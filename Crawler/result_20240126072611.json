        "raw_content": "LG Display Showcases Latest Proprietary OLED Innovations at CES 2024\nSEOUL, Korea (Jan. 07, 2024)\u00a0\u2013 LG Display, the world\u2019s leading innovator of display technologies, announced today that\u00a0it will unveil its latest OLED products based on proprietary technology that revolutionize customer values at CES 2024.\nThe company will operate two booths at the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), with its main booth in the North Hall and an exclusive booth dedicated to automotive displays in the West Hall.\nUnder the theme of \u201cA Better Future,\u201d signifying the company\u2019s various display solutions based on cutting-edge OLED technologies that can revolutionize consumer lifestyles, LG Display will present its latest large-sized OLED technology and next-generation automotive display solutions optimized for Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs).\nAt the main North Hall booth, LG Display will present various large-sized OLED technologies that surpass the limits of OLED picture quality and boast improved performance, including TVs, gaming monitors, and Transparent OLEDs.\nHere, LG Display is set to unveil its latest OLED TV panel that pushes the boundaries of OLED picture quality once again, featuring a significant enhancement from the innovative \u2018META Technology,\u2019 an important milestone reached after a decade of OLED innovation.\nThe company showcased its proprietary \u2018META Technology\u2019 last year, which combines \u2018Micro Lens Array (MLA),\u2019 which maximizes the light emission from organic materials, with a brightness-enhancing algorithm to achieve the highest level of brightness of any existing OLED TV panel.\nIn addition, LG Display will also present its comprehensive lineup of gaming OLEDs spanning from 20 to 40 inches, including the high-performance 27-inch QHD gaming OLED panel that features the world\u2019s first 480Hz ultra-high refresh rate for an OLED display. By generating a remarkable 480 frames per second, the 27-inch 480Hz QHD gaming OLED panel provides the optimal gaming experience with its smooth and sharp visuals, even during fast screen transitions.\nThe 34- and 39-inch panels offer an ultra-wide (21:9) aspect ratio\u00a0for an immersive gaming experience, while the 31.5-inch panel supports a clear UHD (3840\u00d72160) resolution that makes it suitable not only for gaming but also for office work and content consumption.\nLG Display\u2019s gaming OLED panels include millions of self-emitting pixels without a separate backlight source to boast high refresh rates and resolutions, as well as a fast response time of 0.03ms. In addition, the company has incorporated \u2018META Technology\u2019 into its OLED gaming displays to further enhance the overall image quality while minimizing external light reflections during darker scenes.\nFurthermore, LG Display will present its full lineup of Transparent OLEDs, including the 30-, 55-, and 77-inch displays, to present new shopping experiences to retail spaces by creating unique applications through the use of mid-sized and ultra-large Transparent OLED panels.\nAs the world\u2019s only manufacturer of Transparent OLED, LG Display maximizes OLED\u2019s self-emissive nature to achieve a transparency rate high enough to seamlessly replace glass windows, portray accurate color expression, and provide design flexibility that boosts space utilization.\nTransparent OLEDs are also suitable for indoor use thanks to their lower heat generation compared to conventional LEDs, while their versatility allows for installation in almost all spaces and interiors such as windows, walls, and floors of various sizes.\nIn its West Hall booth, LG Display will showcase its ultra-large \u2018Pillar-to-Pillar (P2P)\u2019 display solution optimized for Software Defined Vehicles (SDV), which utilize the company\u2019s differentiated automotive display technologies such as P-OLED, ATO (Advanced Thin OLED), and LTPS (Low-Temperature Polysilicon) LCD.\nThe \u2018Ultra-large P2P P-OLED\u2019 seamlessly integrates a \u201812.3-inch P-OLED\u2019 dashboard display and \u201934-inch P-OLED\u2019 center screen to create a sleek, sophisticated design that covers the entire dashboard as a large singular display. Meanwhile, the \u201948-inch P2P LTPS LCD\u2019 boasts an expansive screen that allows drivers and passengers to see useful driving information while enjoying entertainment features.\nWith the emergence of large displays like P2P, LG Display is also introducing its \u2018Switchable Privacy Mode (SPM),\u2019 which effectively keeps the driver\u2019s focus on the road by controlling the passenger display\u2019s viewing angle.\nLG Display will also showcase solutions that maximize space efficiency within the limited confines of a vehicle while offering new in-car experiences, including the \u201817-inch Foldable OLED\u2019 designed for RSE (Rear Seat Entertainment) and the \u201818-inch Slidable OLED\u2019 that is hidden in the ceiling and can be extended downwards for use.\nIn addition, the company\u2019s differentiated \u2018Thin Actuator Sound Solution\u2019, which is just 30 percent of the weight and 10 percent of the thickness of a conventional car speaker, can be installed in various areas inside the vehicle, such as the display, ceiling, and floor, for a richer, more 3D immersive sound experience.\nMoreover, LG Display will present cutting-edge technologies engineered to make spaces more aesthetically pleasing, such as an \u2018Under Display\u2019 that conceals the cameras installed on the display by adjusting the overall transparency, and \u2018Decorative Film\u2019 that allows screens to resemble interior materials such as wood or carbon when inactive.\nBy unveiling display solutions that unlock new experiences for global consumers, LG Display plans to strengthen its business competitiveness even further and secure potential customers through its differentiated products and technologies.\nRelated Posts\nLG Display Presents a New Era of OLED Picture Quality with \u2018META Technology 2.0\u2019 at CES 2024\nLG Display Presents Latest OLED-Inspired Experiences at K-Display 2023\nLG Display Showcases Innovative OLED Technologies at CES 2023\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2021 LG DISPLAY CO., LTD.\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2024 LG DISPLAY CO., LTD.

        "raw_content": "The best monitors we saw at CES 2024\nIt was all about monitors at CES 2024, and we had a chance to see a lot of them. Samsung has exciting new gaming displays, Asus is pushing refresh rates to places they\u2019ve never gone, and Acer is experimenting with some exciting glasses-free 3D tech. And that\u2019s just the products I could fit in a three-item list.\nYes, we saw some exciting monitors at CES this year. Here are the best monitors we had a chance to lay our eyes on.\nLG dual refresh rate OLED\nIt really didn\u2019t take long for refresh rates to shoot up on OLED monitors. Just last year, we saw the first crop of 240Hz OLED displays, and we already have a 480Hz OLED from LG this year. It\u2019s not 480Hz across the board, but LG is able to provide such a high refresh rate with its interesting dual refresh rate feature.\nBasically, the monitor is a 32-inch, 4K OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate in its base form. However, LG lets you toggle over to a 1080p resolution at 480Hz with a single button. It plays both the high-resolution, cinematic side of gaming and the super-fast competitive side, allowing you to have the best experience for the game you\u2019re playing.\nI suspect something like this has been possible for a while \u2014 lower resolution should mean you can achieve a higher refresh rate. LG is just making it a reality. Last year, we were singing the praises of the first 500Hz displays, regardless of how mediocre the image quality was. Now, you can get that same speed on an OLED panel, and that\u2019s something to get excited about.\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G8\nSamsung is finally being boring, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited. Instead of insane curves and crazy aspect ratios, the 2024 Odyssey OLED G8 is a flat, 32-inch gaming monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It earns its stripes with a second-gen QD-OLED panel, however, and the introduction of 4K to the world of OLED gaming monitors.\nOn top of that, it sports a brand-new design that manages to look even better than last year\u2019s model. It has the same slim silver frame, but the CoreSync bias lighting on the back is now brighter, and the stand is slightly smaller. The look elevates a gaming space, and that\u2019s more than I can say for most other gaming monitors.\nThe specs are definitely here, too. You\u2019re getting a 4K panel with a 240Hz refresh rate and, as usual, the stunning contrast of OLED. We\u2019ll have to get this display under the microscope once it\u2019s available, but it looks like an easy pick for the best gaming monitor of 2024 if it holds up. This is just the start, too. Other monitors are packing these same panels, including the new Alienware 27 QD-OLED and 32 QD-OLED.\nDell UltraSharp 120Hz displays\nGaming monitors have received all the love over the past few years, but Dell is changing that. Its new UltraSharp productivity displays are getting a big upgrade with a 120Hz refresh rate, finally bringing the smooth, premium feel of a gaming monitor to the desktop.\nThe UltraSharp 34 and UltraSharp 40 are curved 21:9 monitors, both of which use an IPS Black panel. The key feature here is the refresh rate, of course, but they come with a slew of other premium features, as well. Those include an integrated Thunderbolt hub and a built-in KVM switch.\nThe displays are pricey, with the 34-inch model coming in over $1,000, but it\u2019s still nice to see some premium options in the world of productivity monitors. For too long, productivity displays have been stuck with the same bog-standard IPS panels and 60Hz refresh rates, and these two new Dell displays are changing that.\nAsus 480Hz OLED monitor\nThis one definitely came out of left field. Asus has a 1440p OLED monitor with a native 480Hz refresh rate. No, that\u2019s not a typo. 1440p. OLED. 480Hz. I would do the cliche of asking what more you could want, but the specs really speak for themself here.\nI\u2019m shocked. LG Display and Samsung Display make the lion\u2019s share of panels for gaming monitors, so we normally know what to expect from brands like Asus at CES. Not this year. It seems Asus is the only one pushing this high of a refresh rate on an OLED monitor at 1440p, truly putting it in a class of its own.\nEven more impressive is that Asus is claiming this display can hit a peak brightness of 1,300 nits, which would certainly make it the most impressive OLED we\u2019ve ever seen. This is one we\u2019ll need to test thoroughly once it\u2019s available, but the specs alone are enough to get me excited.\nSamsung 2D/3D gaming monitor\nI\u2019ve never been on the train of glasses-free 3D monitors. They just haven\u2019t worked that well, but Samsung is changing that. The 2D/3D gaming monitor, as you might guess from the name, is more of a tech showcase than an actual monitor you can buy. But it\u2019s a tease of what Samsung is cooking up, and we\u2019ll hopefully hear more about it later this year.\nAs the name implies, this is a monitor that you can instantly switch from 2D to 3D, allowing you to have a solid gaming display when you need it or an immersive 3D monitor when you want it. It works with two cameras that track your eyes and head, providing a 3D view in any game you can throw at it. What surprised me most was that the tracking actually worked, getting around the dreaded sweet spot issue we\u2019ve seen with previous glasses-free 3D displays.\nIn addition to standard games, the monitor supports VR games and content so that you can play them without a headset. We need to see more from this monitor, but for early impressions, it was definitely among the most impressive displays I saw at CES this year.\nPredator SpatialLabs View 27\nSpeaking of glasses-free 3D, Acer has been chipping away at the tech for years with Spatial Labs. We saw this tech for the first time last year at CES, but only in laptops. Now, Acer is applying it to a 4K gaming monitor, fit with a 27-inch size and a resolution of 160Hz.\nAcer\u2019s implementation is better than Samsung\u2019s, mainly because only a select list of games is supported through Spatial Labs. The list is fairly large at 50 titles and growing, and you can still use the monitor for standard 2D titles.\nAcer may not have support for any game, or support for VR titles, but the experience is much better, and it\u2019s a real monitor that you\u2019ll be able to buy. Acer says the display will be available in the first half of this year for $2,000. Pricey, but that\u2019s the cost of cutting-edge gaming tech.\nAsus ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH\nWhat\u2019s better than an OLED monitor? A portable OLED monitor that you can fold and put into a backpack, obviously. That\u2019s what Asus is offering with its ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH. It\u2019s a 17.3-inch OLED display that folds into a 12.5-inch package, and with a weight of only 2.4 pounds, it\u2019s easy to carry with you wherever you go.\nFoldable screens still aren\u2019t perfect, but this is the best application of foldable OLED we\u2019ve seen so far. A kickstand is built into the display, allowing you to configure it for either a horizontal or vertical orientation. It\u2019s quite a hefty stand, but if you\u2019re looking for a more secure mount, Asus also includes a tripod mounting hole.\nWe don\u2019t have a ton of details on the display yet, namely its price or availability. Asus tells me it will likely be on the more expensive end, but that\u2019s expected for an OLED display you can throw in your bag.\nHP Omen Transcend 32\nHP has released plenty of gaming monitors under its Omen brand, but it\u2019s certainly not the first company you think of when it comes to premium gaming displays. That\u2019s changing with the HP Omen Transcend 32. It\u2019s a QD-OLED monitor that measures 32 inches, and it\u2019s capable of a 4K resolution at up to 240Hz.\nWe\u2019ve seen a handful of similar monitors this year at CES, but this one is shocking because it comes from HP. It definitely wins some style points, too. The white shell looks wonderful, especially contrasted against a square of RGB lights around the back of the monitor.\nElsewhere, the monitor supports 140 watts of power delivery over USB-C, which is a first in this class of gaming monitor. This is HP\u2019s first QD-OLED gaming monitor, so we\u2019ll have to test it properly before making a judgment. It\u2019s certainly a stunner from our early preview, though.\nI\u2019m sorry to say it, but I'd be lying if I said otherwise. NPUs are useless. Maybe that comes off as harsh, but it doesn\u2019t come from a place of cynicism. After testing them myself, I'm genuinely convinced that there\u2019s not a compelling use for NPUs right now.\nWhen you go to buy your next laptop, there\u2019s a good chance it will have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) inside of it, and AMD and Intel have been making a big fuss about how these NPUs will drive the future of the AI PC. I don\u2019t doubt that we\u2019ll get there eventually, but in terms of a modern use case, an NPU really isn\u2019t as effective as you might think.\nI'm worried about Nvidia's upcoming RTX 4080 Super, but probably not for the reason you think. Nvidia revealed the long-rumored GPU at CES 2024, and perhaps the most shocking news around the announcement was that Nvidia was going to drop the price. Instead of releasing at the same $1,200 list price as the original RTX 4080, the RTX 4080 Super is launching at $1,000.\nIt's a great price, and a positive step for Nvidia, which has largely been seen as the driving force behind high GPU prices over the past year. I'm worried the price might be too good, though.\nMSI is entering the handheld arena, and its debut is more significant than you might think. The MSI Claw doesn't look dissimilar from the Asus ROG Ally or even the Steam Deck OLED, but the specs underneath mark a significant departure for handheld gaming PCs.\nI had a chance to try the device at CES 2024, and it's definitely a contender. Bolstered with a new chipset, a comfortable design, and software designed to tackle the issues with Windows on a handheld, this might be the portable gaming PC to buy this year.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nLana Del Rey Channels Old Hollywood Screen Sirens in Skims' Valentine's Day Line -- Here's When It Launches Online\nA New 'Barbie' Book Will Reveal Margot Robbie's Never-Before-Seen Press Tour Looks, Rare Mattel Photos and More\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office. It\u2019s expected to launch on Amazon this year.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nSofia Richie Expecting Baby Girl With Husband Elliot Grainge\n\u2018Mission: Impossible \u2014 Dead Reckoning\u2019 Is Now Streaming: Here\u2019s Where To Watch It Online\nDetroit Lions vs. San Francisco 49ers: How to Stream the NFC Championship Game Online Free\nCES 2024: The 15+ Best Smart Home Tech Finds for Your Kitchen, Bathroom, Nursery and More\nHow to Watch the Gypsy Rose Blanchard \u201820/20\u2019 Special on TV and Online\n\u2018Masters of the Air\u2019: Where to Watch the World War II Drama Miniseries Online\nMost Popular\nBody Language Experts Noticed the \u2018Unusual\u2019 Gesture Barron Trump Extended to Dad Donald\nBarstool, DraftKings Near Sports Betting Deal After Penn Lock-Up\nArtist Who Performed in the Nude at MoMA's 2010 Marina Abramovic Exhibition Sues the Museum\nJess Hilarious Calls DJ Envy, Charlamagne The God \"Trash\" After Months Of Co-Hosting 'The Breakfast Club'\nYou may also like\nThis Best-Selling Flybird Weight Bench Is Just $111 on Amazon Today\nThis Massive New Superyacht Doubles as a Submarine That Can Dive 820 Feet Underwater\nKanye West Shares Our Bestie \u201cMiss Westie,\u201d North West, Storyboarding Her Own Music\u00a0Video\nBrent Faiyaz Teases Short Film Starring Actress Lupita\u00a0Nyong\u2019o\nSubscriber Support\nThe Hollywood Reporter\nLegal\nFollow Us\nNewsletter Sign Up\nHave a Tip?\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nOur Sites\nNews\nExpand news menu\nFilm\nExpand film menu\nTV\nExpand tv menu\nAwards\nExpand awards menu\nLifestyle\nExpand lifestyle menu\nBusiness\nExpand business menu\nMore Essentials\nExpand more-essentials menu\nFollow Us\nAlerts & Newsletters\noptional screen reader"
