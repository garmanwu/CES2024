The Joint Pavilion is expected to draw more attention in Eureka Park with the scale of integration and expansion compared to the previous year.\nThe selected companies will receive one-stop integrated services, from pre-consulting for CES, on-site exhibition and interpretation, IR presentations, and follow-up management. In particular, consulting training was conducted in order to receive the Innovation Award given to companies possessing innovative technology and aesthetic design at the CES. With this, 17 companies succeeded in winning the CES 2023 Innovation Award.\nIn addition, SBA signed separate partnerships with the business groups of 4 universities (Kyunghee, Kookmin, Sogang, Chung-ang) and the Korea Institute of Startup & Entrepreneurship Development to give effective support for the exhibition. 50 university student supporters were also selected for close local support for the 50 exhibiting companies in the KOSTARTUP Joint Pavilion.\nThe selected university students are set to be matched 1:1 with startups in their desired fields and taught about their corresponding companies in advance to improve their understanding of these companies. In addition to preparation for the exhibition and on-site interpretation, these measures are also expected to support the companies' business communication.\nHyunwoo Kim, the CEO of the Seoul Business Agency (SBA), said that \"While we plan to propose a future vision of Seoul evolving with technology with the world's biggest IT expo, CES, as the stage, we also plan to actively support the expansion of innovative startups, which lead Seoul's startup ecosystem, into global markets.\"\nSOURCE Seoul Business Agency\nModal title\nAlso from this source\nSeoul Integrated Pavilion at CES 2024 Showcased Advanced Seoul Lifestyle, Growing Startups Into Global Unicorns\nSeoul Business Agency (SBA), Seoul's support organization for small and medium-sized enterprises, announced that it successfully exhibited the 'Seoul ...\nSeoul Business Agency (SBA) Hosts Seoul Innovation Forum at CES 2024\nSeoul Business Agency (SBA), Seoul's innovation support organization working towards creating a smart city in Seoul, held the Seoul Innovation Forum...\nExplore\nComputer & Electronics\nGreen Technology\nEnvironmental Products & Services\nTransportation, Trucking & Railroad\nSign up for Top Stories & curated News delivered to your inbox\nThank you for subscribing!\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout\nMy Services\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout"
