With Active Tread, we can achieve both and be ahead of the rest of the world.\u201d\nThe company also boasts \u201cSensing Core\u201d technology, which transforms tyres into sensors by gathering real-time data on road conditions, tyre wear, load, and air pressure, using data such as tyre rotational speed and the amount of tyre slip on the road surface as key indicators.\n\u201cIn the future, we aim to create tyres that can be used continuously regardless of region or season and are less susceptible to weather changes. Additionally, by reducing the need to replace tyres, we will reduce the burden on the environment and contribute to the realisation of a more sustainable society,\u201d added President Yamamoto.\nThe specific features, prices, and availability of the new tyres with Active Tread will be announced in 2024.\nRefining new technologies\nWith the rise of electric vehicles, autonomous vehicles, car sharing, ride sharing and other new types of mobility services, the automotive industry is increasingly seeing a shift in the role that vehicles play. Consequently, there are major changes in the functional and performance requirements of tyres.\nWith an eye toward the Mobility Society of the Future, the Sumitomo Rubber Group is actively pushing ahead with research and development under its Smart Tyre Concept. This catchall term describes the group\u2019s ongoing efforts to develop the various technologies that will create the tyres of the future.\nLocally, Sumitomo Rubber South Africa is investing significantly into its passenger car radial production facility which will allow the company to manufacture a wider set of products that meet and exceed OE specifications and future automotive industry requirements. The investment includes new plant equipment and machinery.\nThe new high-spec, technology-driven equipment and optimised production processes will reduce the plant\u2019s environmental impact, aligned to Sumitomo Rubber Industries\u2019 global sustainability goal of zero carbon emissions by 2050.\nLiana Shaw\nDownload Latest SATreads Digital Magazine\nDownload Latest SATreads Digital Magazine\n\u00a9 2020\n- SA Treads news & tyre portal\n\u00a9 2020\n- SA Treads news & tyre portal\nWelcome Back!\nLogin to your account below\nRemember Me\nRetrieve your password\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\nAdd New Playlist\n- Select Visibility -PublicPrivate"

The three companies will collaborate with LanzaTech on the joint development, aiming to pioneer groundbreaking technologies that enable a circular economy, transforming waste materials, including rubber, resin, urethane, and metal, into valuable resources.\nThe Sumitomo Electric Group \"2030 VISION\" calls for company-wide efforts to promote carbon-free and other businesses in order to achieve a \"Green Society.\u201d Additionally, the Mid-term Management Plan 2025 promotes initiatives to realize a circular economy. To date, we have promoted activities to collect used products and recycle them as raw materials.\nThis time around, we are taking another step forward to accomplish a circular economy for raw materials. Together with Sumitomo Riko and Sumitomo Rubber, we are pushing ahead with the development of new technologies in collaboration with LanzaTech. We aim to leverage LanzaTech\u2019s biorecycling technology to turn waste materials, such as tires and resins, into isoprene, which can be used as new rubber materials.\nThis will be achieved by gasifying the waste materials and purifying the resulting gas, and then putting them through a fermentation process that transforms the gas into new raw materials. Our ultimate goal is to work with raw material producers to explore the feasibility of establishing a recycling technology that enables the reuse of isoprene as materials for rubber and resin. Since we manufacture number of products made of resin and metal, such as wiring harnesses and power/communication cables, we will also consider recycling the metals recovered during the gasifying process and reusing them as raw materials.\nThrough the joint technological development, we will accelerate our contribution to the achievement of a \"Green Society\" through our products and services.\nCollaborative R&D framework\nCompany Overview\nSumitomo Riko Company Limited\nHeadquarters\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\uff1a\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01-1-1 Meieki, Nakamura-ku, Nagoya-shi, Aichi, Japan\nRepresentative\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\uff1a\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Kazushi Shimizu, Representative Director, President & CEO\nFounded\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\uff1a\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01929\nBusiness Overview\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\uff1a\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Harnessing its core competencies in polymer materials technology and comprehensive evaluation technology, Sumitomo Riko operates across four fields: Automotive (Mobility), Infrastructure and Housing Environment, Electronics, and Healthcare.\nSumitomo Rubber Industries, Ltd.\nHeadquarters\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a03-6-9 Wakinohama-cho, Chuo-ku, Kobe, Hyogo, Japan\nRepresentative\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Satoru Yamamoto, Representative Director, President & CEO\nFounded\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a01909\nBusiness Overview\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0:\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0Sumitomo Rubber manufactures and sells tires, sporting goods, and industrial products.

One of the steps taken was discontinuing the production of styrene solution butadiene rubber at its Singapore plant.\nThe plant, which has been operational since 2014, can produce approximately 40,000 metric tons of synthetic rubber materials per year. As part of its strategic steps, the company has decided to withdraw from the production of Caprolactam, dyestuffs, and chemical fertilizers segments. At present, the company is actively reviewing its display materials operations to optimize efficiency.\nAs part of its cost-reduction measures, the company plans to purchase low-priced raw materials and improve yields to lower manufacturing costs. The company also aims to enhance work efficiency through digitalization while reducing general expenses. During a financial presentation on May 15th, the group announced that it is almost done with its exit from the EPDM segment.\nSumitomo Rubber Industries Ltd. aims to attain a core operating income of approximately $1.5 billion within two years. The company, based in Tokyo, disclosed that its core operating income for the fiscal year 2022, which ended on March 31, was $668.2 million. However, Sumitomo Chemical projects that the figure will decline by more than half to approximately $290.5 million for the following fiscal year. Exiting from the markets is expected to yield roughly $181.5 million for the company by the end of fiscal 2024, which concludes in March 2025.\nSumitomo Chemical has announced its decision to halt the production of elastomer materials in Chiba, Japan by March 2023. The move comes as part of the company's efforts to enhance the value proposition of its product offerings and minimize manufacturing expenses, thus bolstering its overall competitiveness in the market.\nDue to the advanced age of the facility, it has become increasingly challenging to maintain a balance between production efficiency and profitability while also dealing with rising maintenance and repair costs. The manufacturing plant located in Chiba specializes in producing EPDM materials and currently has an annual capacity of 40,000 metric tons per year.\nSumitomo Chemical currently holds a 50% stake in the Petro Rabigh joint venture with Saudi Aramco, which produces 75,000 metric tons of EPDM annually in Saudi Arabia. It remains uncertain whether Sumitomo Chemical intends to withdraw from its partnership with Petro Rabigh.\n24X7\nTrack Real Time Prices\nRelated News\nSUBSCRIBETODAY\nIndustry Report\nEthylene Propylene Diene Monomer (EPDM) Rubber Market Analysis: Industry Market Size, Plant Capacity, Production, Operating Efficiency, Demand & Supply, End-User Industries, Grade, Sales Channel, Regional Demand, Foreign Trade, Company Share, Manufacturing Process, Policy and Regulatory Landscape, 2015-2035\n24X7\nTrack Real Time Prices\nFollow Us On:\nCopyright \u00a9 ChemAnalyst - 2020 | Terms & Conditions | Privacy Policy"

Both Sumitomo Rubber and Sumitomo Electric will now join this partnership to form a circular economy by transforming waste materials \u2013 including rubber, resin, urethane and metal \u2013 into new resources.\nThrough the TOWANOWA circular economy concept, Sumitomo Rubber will use LanzaTech\u2019s bio-recycling technology to transform waste materials from tires into isoprene, which can then be used as new rubber materials. The collaboration will achieve this by gasifying the waste materials and purifying the resulting gas. This will then be put through a fermentation process to turn the gas into new raw materials.\nThe collaboration\u2019s end goal is to work with raw material manufacturers to evaluate the feasibility of establishing a recycling technology which enables the reuse of isoprene as materials for rubber and resin. The group is also seeking to recycle metals recovered during the gasifying process, before reusing them as raw materials.\nThe group manufactures and sells a diverse selection of tires globally \u2013 annual tire sales total 110,000,000 (as of 2022). As new tires are manufactured and sold, a significant number of tires are thrown away every year. Many tires that get discarded in Japan are later incinerated, with the generated heat being put to practical use.\nSumitomo Rubber states it must advance its \u201cRecovery and Recycling\u201d initiatives to make the TOWANOWA circular economy concept work.\nLiberty Tire Recycling announces new president and CCO\nToyo Tires develops concept tire using 90% sustainable materials\nContinental takes strides toward sustainable operations\nType above and press Enter to search.
