Here\u2019s how it works.\nI just rode Segway\u2019s new $500 electric scooter at CES 2024 \u2014 and it's perfect for commuters\nTaking the new Segway for a spin at CES 2024\nAt CES 2024, Segway introduced its newest made-for-commuters electric scooter, the $499 E2 Pro. While it has somewhat modest performance specs by the standards of some of the best electric scooters, it does offer a few safety features not found on other scooters in its price range.\nI was able to take the E2 Pro for a test ride at CES, and also check out Segway's other offerings, including two new radical electric bikes and an updated GoKart that can be used to play video games. Here's a rundown of everything I saw.\nAlso, be sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nElectric scooters\nSegway E2 series\nThe E2 series \u2014 The E2, E2 Plus, and E2 Pro \u2014 look to be Segway's new bread-and-butter offering this year. All three share some commonalities, such as a 2.8-inch display and IPX6 water resistance, but there are a few variations between each model.\nWhen I rode the E2 Pro around a parking lot at CES 2024, it accelerated smoothly and quickly, was very nimble and felt smooth.\nThe Segway E2, which is the starting model, has a 12.4-mile range at top speed and a max speed of 12.4 m.p.h. Its 450W motor can handle grades of up to 12 percent, and it has a front electronic brake, a rear drum brake, and 8.1-inch tires. When I rode the E2 Pro around a parking lot, it accelerated smoothly and quickly, was very nimble and felt smooth (though there were very few bumps).\nThe E2 Plus has a slightly more powerful 500W motor, and can reach a top speed of 15.5 MPH. In addition, it has ambient RGB lights underneath the bottom deck, so you can put on a bit of a light show.\nThe E2 Pro is the standout model, with a 16.8-mile range, 15.5 MPH top speed, and a 750W motor that can handle grades of up to 18%. In addition, it has turn signal indicators in its handlebars (like the Segway Ninebot Kickscooter Max G2), Apple FindMy, ambient lights like the E2 Plus, a traction control system and 10-inch tires.\nAll three models can be preordered now; the preorder price for the E2 Pro is $449; its regular sale price will be $499.\nSegway Superscooter ST1\nIf you're looking for something a bit more wild, the Segway Superscooter (ST1) has a maximum speed of 31 mph and dual suspension, putting it in the same class as the Apollo City 2023. However, the ST1 has larger 11-inch tires and dual disc brakes. Other features include a 2.4-inch color display, Apple Find My built-in (in case someone tries to steal it), and a switchable hi- and low-beam headlight, a first for any scooter I've seen.\nSegway has not released expected range, but the ST1 has a 716Wh battery. That's about 200Wh less than the Apollo, but should get you at least 30 miles on a charge. Pricing has not been announced, but the ST1 should be available for sale in late 2024.\nElectric bikes\nSegway is also expanding into the electric bike category with two very striking models, the Segway Xafari (pronounced \"safari\") and the Segway Xyber (\"cyber\"). While neither could be described as having \"traditional\" ebike looks, the Xafari comes closest, while the Xyber looks like a futuristic cafe racer.\nWhile both have different use cases in mind, they do share some common features, including a \"smart cockpit\" display that will give the rider constant updates on their speed, mileage, sensors and navigation.\nA feature called Active Scene Perception will cause the bikes to adjust power output, lighting and other settings based on the road conditions and what the rider is doing.\nBoth bikes will also connect to an app, and have several anti-theft features, such as hidden real wheel hub locks, GPS and location-based alarms.\nPricing has yet to be revealed for either model, both of which should be available later this year.\nThe more radical of the two bikes, the Segway Xyber, looks even better in person than in the renders. It's packed with a 175Nm Torque high speed motor that can accelerate the ride from 0 to 19.8 mph in 2.5 seconds. The seat is designed to accommodate a rider and a passenger.\nThe bike can be outfitted with two batteries, for a maximum output of 1440 Wh, which Segway says can extend its range up to 95 miles. Additionally, it has front and rear 120mm suspension, as well as custom wide tires.\u00a0As it's classified as an electric bike, its top speed will be limited.\nI wasn't able to take the Xyber out for a real ride, but I was able to pedal it around for a little, and despite the bike's size and weight, it was fairly easy to get around. However, I expect that most riders will just use the throttle.\nThe Xafari is an off-road ebike, with a full suspension design (80mm in the front and 70mm in the rear) with fat 26x3.0 all-terrain tires. It's powered by a 750W motor and a 913 Wh battery. It has a step-through design, and can fit riders from 4'11\" to 6'3\". The bike also comes standard with a rear rack, though I would have also liked to see fenders, given its offroad capabilities.\nGo-Karts\nLast but not least, Segway is releasing its second-generation Go-Kart, the GoKart Pro 2, which looks to be as much fun on the road as well as when it's parked in your house.\nOn the street, the Go-Kart can hit speeds of up to 26.7 m.p.h \u2014 faster than that of the current Go-Kart Pro's 23 m.p.h \u2014 and has a range of up to 15.5 miles. A new detachable Bluetooth speaker also lets you listen to tunes on the road, and can also simulate engine sounds.\u00a0Like Segway's earlier GoKarts, this one was serious fun to drive, though it is a bit cramped for someone who's as tall as me.\nBut the fun continues inside your home, too, as the Go-Kart can turn into a racing controller \u2014 complete with haptic feedback \u2014 when connected to a gaming console. At the time of this writing, Segway would not say which consoles or games it would work with, but I imagine that Mario Kart would be pretty epic.\u00a0(I'll have more on this in a later story.)\nThe GoKart Pro 2 can be preordered for $1,799; its regular price will be $2,299.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "Micromobility at CES 2024: Segway Test Rides!\nOur final day at the Consumer Electronics Show was all about Segway! Tyson left the show floor and trekked to Segway\u2019s test track location, where they had assembled a variety of scooters, electric bikes, and even a go-kart for test rides. We were especially excited to see their new prototypes: The Xyber, an electric motorcycle masquerading as an electric bike, and the Xafari, a comfortable and sporty adventure e-bike.\nHello friends, and welcome to my final article recapping micromobility tech at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show. There was so much there that I couldn't get to it all! If you missed the rest of the series, here's Part 1 and Part 2. For my final day in Las Vegas I focused on Segway, a widely recognized brand that brought a wide array of light electric vehicles to the show. Even better, they rented an off-site parking lot and offered free test rides! While I was sad they didn't have their fully electric dune buggy available for testing, they did have a full lineup of scooters as well as their new e-bike prototypes. Watch the below video to ride along with me as I test ride everything they have on offer; If reading is more your thing, I'll cover the highlights below, and also share some of my off-camera thoughts.\nMany people are very excited about Segway's prototype two-wheelers, so let's just start with them. First up, the Xyber: It's part motorcycle, part electric bike, and incredibly fun to ride. It definitely feels more motorcycle than it does e-bike; knobby motorcycle tires, huge brake rotors, heavy-duty suspension with a wide triple-clamp fork, and two enormous batteries. I didn't get an official weight but I estimate about 120 lbs (54 kg)... this thing is heavy. Plus it's got a 3,000 watt rear hub motor, and I was able to quickly accelerate to 30 mph (48 kph) on the test track. It could have gone much faster, but sadly the test track was pretty small.\nSo far, I was loving everything about the Xyber, except for the fact that it had pedals on it. Some footpegs would have felt perfect! The Xyber has a very compact geometry, even more so than the usual minibike-style e-bike, so pedaling just kinda sucks, especially on my lanky 6'3\" frame. Things get even stranger when you look more in-depth at the drivetrain: it's single speed, and pedal assist uses an impressively responsive torque sensor. Torque sensors are great, of course, but... why on this bike? The compact design makes pedaling so uncomfortable that almost no one will want to use pedal assist, except maybe in short bursts. \"But Tyson, if you run out of battery you can still pedal home!\" Yeah, sure, you try pedaling this 120-pound tank with no electric assist and only a single speed drivetrain. The final head-scratcher is that Segway plans to release the Xyber as a Class 2 electric bike restricted to 20 mph (32 kph). Unless they change pretty much everything about the bike, I just can't see anyone wanting to buy it in that configuration... and what a waste to have a 3,000 watt motor and then restrict it so much! I'm hoping they at least have an optional \"offroad mode\" that unlocks it's full power.\nSegway's other e-bike prototype, the Xafari, was a different story: it has a clear design vision as an adventure e-bike and that vision is executed flawlessly. I honestly didn't have anything bad to say about it, though there were a few things that weren't yet functional (like the turn signals) due to it being a prototype. It features 3\" wide tires which are what I consider the sweet spot for an off-road adventure bike, providing plenty of float and traction but being much lighter and more nimble than 4\" fat tires. The torque sensor is perfectly tuned for a responsive pedaling experience, and the motor is surprisingly quiet, especially for how zippy it is; hitting and maintaining the top speed of 28 mph (45 kph) is easy on the highest setting. The geometry is comfortable with a forward-ish seating position, and I really liked the design aesthetics. The best way to describe it is \"undeniably Segway\".\nSegway's got a scooter for every rider: entry-level commuters, premium commuters, all-purpose scooters that can handle some off-road adventuring in addition to pavement, and beastly speed demons that can conquer anything. I was impressed by Segway's design consistency across their entire line; they use similar control systems and layouts on all of their scooters, and - unsurprisingly - it's a good setup. The controls are intuitive to use, headlights are positioned high up on the handlebars where they should be, and turn signals are embedded in the ends of the grips, excellent positioning for maximum visibility. Plus you get bright brake light activation, seamless internal routing of cables... every one of their scooters is designed and built extremely well.\nScooter performance was excellent across the board, although I of course had the most fun on their high-end models. The GT2 is their \"beast mode\" model: It has a top speed of 43 mph (69 kph), and it can reach that speed in a terrifyingly short amount of time. I was able to get to about 35 mph (56 kph) in roughly two seconds before I had to start braking due to how small the test track was. This scooter has two motors outputting 1,500 watts each, easily the most powerful scooter I've ever ridden. The acceleration curve is impressively smooth with a nice roll-on of power, although adrenaline junkies can enable Turbo Mode which enables instant acceleration. It also turns the entire display red, and you'll want to hold on tight when hitting the throttle.\nWhen it comes to build quality and design, the GT2 is easily the best scooter I've ever ridden. It's amazingly rugged, with a beefy stem, thick deck, and nice large 12\" wheels. The stem does fold down, but only at roughly the halfway point; clearly, Segway decided to prioritize rugged strength over portability, a decision which I support 100%. At some point you have to accept that your 90 lb (41 kg) scooter is just never going to be convenient to move or store, and simply make it as good as possible at it's intended purpose: high-speed adventure riding! The steering column is also significantly dampened, meaning it's hard to turn which provides excellent stability at speed. Most scooters require an aftermarket dampener to be installed, so kudos to Segway for doing it the right way.\nFor those who want a thrilling ride but aren't ready for the aggressive behemoth that is the GT2, the ST1 is the perfect choice. It can still go plenty fast with a top speed of roughly 33 mph (53 kph), with satisfying acceleration from the 1,000 watt motor in the rear hub. It is also sturdily built, with a dampened steering column for stable high-speed riding. It's wheels are a smaller 10\" in diameter, so it can't roll over obstacles as well as the GT2, but will still perform well on light trails, and of course in urban environments.\nOverall, I'm quite impressed with Segway's lineup. It's clear that they have put a lot of R&D into each one of their products, and - with the exception of the Xyber - it has resulted in products that are expertly tailored for their intended use case. I love their focus on safety, with integrated lighting and signaling features executed as well as I've seen any company do it. I'm stoked to test out the final versions of the Xafari and Xyber, and to see what other products Segway brings to market in 2024!\nSubscribe to Ride Review\nJoin Ride Review Newsletter"

        "raw_content": "Segway\u2019s New E-Bikes Are Basically High-Tech Motorcycles\nThe Xyber and Xafari blur the line between e-moto and e-bike.\nIf you\u2019ve ever ridden an e-bike, you might get the sense that they feel like the future \u2014 they\u2019re fast, sustainable, and most importantly, not another car clogging up roadways.\nFeeling like the future isn\u2019t enough; they have to act like the future, too. And on that front, Segway is seemingly prepared to deliver.\nAt CES 2024, the e-mobility faithful introduced two sleek e-bikes called the Xafari and the Xyber. Somewhat cringe cyberpunk branding aside, both e-bikes bring some pretty cool tech to the two-wheeled table.\nThe Xafari and Xyber E-Bikes\nThe biggest sell here is what Segway is calling Active Scene Perception, which adjusts bike parameters based on \u201cperception of the road conditions and the user...\u201d Segway doesn\u2019t get into too much detail on how this works exactly, but I assume it\u2019d have to take advantage of some kind of suite of sensors.\nSegway also says the bikes have an integration with mobile health apps (this is still a bike after all, and you could theoretically exercise on it) that can track metrics like mileage and speed in real time. Both e-bikes also have speakers, sensor-equipped headlights, music playback, and navigation that\u2019s displayed on a color screen.\nSegway\u2019s Xyber e-bike.\nIt\u2019s not all software, though. Part of what makes Segway\u2019s bikes noteworthy is how close they come to qualifying as motorcycles. The Xyber, for example, which is the more performance-oriented model, uses a \u201cmotorcycle-class double cradle frame system\u201d according to Segway.\nIt\u2019s also designed to transport two riders at once, which is atypical for an e-bike. And design-wise, I\u2019d say it comes pretty close to Sondors\u2019 Metacycle \u2014 an affordable electric motorcycle with Cybertruck-like vibes. When it comes to speed, this is firmly still an e-bike in the end, though. Segway doesn\u2019t list top speed but says that the Xyber can go from 0 to 20 mph in about 2.5 seconds. With both batteries equipped, Segway says the Xyber can get a formidable 95 miles of range.\nSegway\u2019s Xafari e-bike.\nAs you may have guessed from the name, the Xafari model is more geared toward riders who want to go offroad. This beastly e-bike has full suspension, a 750W motor, and all-terrain tires. Plus, Segway says the \u201cintelligent power adjustment system dynamically responds to real-time user status and environmental conditions, ensuring seamless support for riders.\u201d This sounds like part of the aforementioned Active Scene Perception, but the details are a little sparse.\nXyber and Xafari Release Date\nIf you\u2019re liking what Segway is putting down, you\u2019ll have to wait a little bit before you throw your money down; both bikes will be released in \u201clate 2024.\u201d And speaking of money, there\u2019s no official word on how much either will cost. My advice would be to start saving now.\nINVERSE brings you everything from the fun and futuristic world of consumer technology at CES 2024.

        "raw_content": "Segway expands its smart home footprint with robot lawn mowers at CES 2024\nSegway \u2014 the company responsible for Paul Blart\u2019s preferred mode of transportation \u2014 already has a surprisingly robust smart home lineup. The company expanded its catalog at CES 2024, revealing a new series of robot lawn mowers (Navimow i Series) and a new portable power station (Segway Cube Series).\nThe upcoming Navimow i Series makes a few big improvements over Segway\u2019s existing H Series. Along with the ability to work without wires (which are typically used to set boundaries for the robot), the i Series employs a technology known as the Exact Fusion Locating System (EFLS). Segway says this will let the robot lawn mower better track its location and ensure it\u2019s cutting your lawn as close to specifications as possible.\nAlong with the EFLS location-tracking tech, the Navimow i Series comes with a built-in vision system to avoid obstacles and better pinpoint its location. This should improve its performance in areas with heavy tree cover that would otherwise inhibit its ability to monitor its positioning.\nAs you\u2019d expect, the lineup is IP66-rated for waterproofing and is capable of climbing up to 30-degree slopes. You can even customize cutting patterns through the accompanying smartphone app, as well as program cutting times for autonomous operation.\nSegway also announced the Cube Series portable power station. These are designed to offer reliable power while on the road or at home. Three versions will be available (1kWh, 2kWh, and 3kWh), all of which support over 4,000 cycles and should last around 10 years of normal use. If you need something smaller, the Lumina 500 is a 600W power bank with an adjustable ambient light display and is small enough to fit in your trunk alongside your camping gear.\nExpect to learn more about pricing and launch dates for all Segway\u2019s new products later this year.\nEufy is a big name in the smart home space, and it had plenty of cool gadgets to show off at CES 2024. Along with giving consumers a closer look at four recently launched security cameras, Eufy revealed the X10 Pro Omni robot vacuum and mop, which looks to be an affordable alternative to flagships from Roborock and Ecovacs.\nThe X10 Pro Omni doesn't make any huge innovations in the world of robot vacuums. Most of its features we've already seen on other robots, such as its ability to empty its dustbin, clean its mop, then dry it to prevent the accumulation of mildew. It also boasts an avoidance system to ensure it's not bumping into any shoes, toys, or other items that have accidentally been left in its path. And while its 8,000 Pa of suction is impressive, it's a number a handful of other robots have already hit.\nAnker showed off several products at CES 2024, but few were as compelling as the Solix F3800 Portable Power Station. With a staggering 6,000W output (and the option to chain two together for 12,000W), it's shaping up to be a portable power station that can tackle every task around your home, garage, or campsite.\nThe Solix F3800 is designed as an all-encompassing solution for portable power. Its output allows it to power RVs, directly charge EVs, and run home appliances like your microwave and refrigerator. Along with its 6,000W output, it benefits from up to a 53.8kwh capacity; in other words, it should have more than enough juice to run your gadgets before it needs to recharge itself.\nSamsung SmartThings -- an application designed to connect and control your smart home devices -- doesn't quite get the same attention as platforms like Google Home or Apple HomeKit. However, it made some big announcements at CES 2024, and it's shaping up to be a big year for Samsung's first-party platform. Along with enhanced support for TVs and new uses for QR codes, SmartThings is rolling out a brilliant Map View feature, which creates a digital map of your home and shows you exactly where all your connected devices are located.\nHere's how it works. Instead of scrolling through a list of all your devices or jumping between groups in your smartphone app, Map View lets you see a 3D representation of your home on your smartphone. Inside this map, you'll find icons for all your smart home gadgets corresponding to their actual physical location. That means you can quickly find exactly which device you want to control without needing to scroll through a long list.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."
