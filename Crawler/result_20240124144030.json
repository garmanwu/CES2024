Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "8 of the most innovative and impressive TVs from CES 2024\n1, 2\nGet a daily digest of the latest news in tech, science, and technology, delivered right to your mailbox. Subscribe now.\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Policies You may unsubscribe at any time.\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 is well underway and, rather predictably, the Las Vegas Convention Center show floor is awash with massive, dazzling new screens as well as many other examples of impressive consumer technologies.\nThe main themes when it comes to TVs at this year's CES are transparency, brightness, foldability, and artificial intelligence. Aside from showing off the sheer brightness and sharpness of the latest screens, demos at the CES show floor this year showcase floating images on transparent displays and the dynamic enhancements of AI chips.\nHere are 8 of the most impressive displays shown off at this year's CES tech showcase.\n1. C Seed N1: The world's first 137-inch folding TV\nC Seed\nOne of the biggest trends at this year's CES when it comes to TVs is the idea that they should be aesthetically pleasing when not in use. That can mean they are used as an image display, or that they simply disappear after they are turned off.\nC Seed describes its new foldable N1 TV as the first-ever folding TV of its size. In a press release, the company says it takes just over a minute to unfold the five separate panels into a large 4K display that rises to a height of 7.8 feet (2.3 m). Once no longer in use, the screen then quickly folds back into an inconspicuous box-shaped showpiece that slightly resembles a small cupboard or table.\n2. LG's transparent OLED TV\nLG\nLG's new transparent TV is a show stealer at this year's CES, and it provides a vision of a TV as an art installation when not in use as a regular TV. As with many other TVs at the tech showcase, the concept highlights the fact that a TV should add to the aesthetic quality of the room it's in, rather than detract from it.\nDuring LG's press conference at CES 2024, the company unveiled its wireless and fully transparent TV, the 77-inch Signature OLED T. On the CES show floor, demos of the Signature OLED T displayed fish swimming in transparent glass, orange blobs walking and floating in mid-air, and several other impressive futuristic applications.\n3. Samsung's transparent MicroLED TV\nSamsung always has a big presence at these types of shows and this year was no different. This year, the South Korean tech giant revealed its own transparent offering, the new MicroLED transparent TV.\nThe company's new TV is only a centimeter thick, making images on the screen appear almost like a hologram. The image is much sharper, though, than your typical hologram.\nMicro LED is \"the pinnacle of finely crafted display technology,\" described Jonathan Gabrio, Head of Connected Experience Center, Samsung Electronics America, speaking at the company's\u00a0CES 2024 event.\n4. Samsung's new AI-powered TV\nSamsung\nArtificial intelligence was a massive talking point last year with the emergence of ChatGPT, an AI language model that is already replacing people in many jobs that were previously considered safe from automation.\nUnsurprisingly, AI is now also a big talking point when it comes to new TV tech. Samsung described its new AI TV, the Neo QLED 8K, as a \"beast of an AI screen\" during its CES 2024 press conference.\nThe display is powered by Samsung's latest TV processor, the NQ8 AI Gen3, which features a neural processing unit that works at twice the speed of its predecessor. It also contains 512 neural networks, rather than the 64 in the previous model.\n5. The Samsung S95D glare-free OLED TV\nThe Samsung S95D makes reflections and glare much less noticeable thanks to an anti-glare technology featured on the TV's display. Samsung explained in a press release that the new technology was specifically designed for 2024's OLED screens.\nWhat's more, \"the OLED-optimized, low-reflection coating overcomes the trade-off between gloss and reflection thanks to a new, specialized hard-coating layer and surface coating pattern.\" According to Samsung, it does all of this while preserving \"perfect whites, deeper blacks, and accurate colors.\" In other words, it will retain the impressive picture quality Samsung's OLED TVs are well known for.\n6. Hisense's new rollable 4K laser TV\nHisense\nHisense also showed off its new TV, which it describes as the world's first\u00a08K\u00a0Sonic Screen Laser TV. In a press statement, the company explained that the new TV boasts the \"world's most giant sonic screen with 3.4\u33a1\u00a0sound area and 100,000+ sound units,\" and sound \"that rivals that of a professional cinema.\"\nWhat's more, the laser screen is rollable, meaning users can easily hide the screen away when not in use. This draws comparisons to the C Seed N1's foldability and LG's vision for its transparent TV as an aesthetic centerpiece to a living room. Hisense's rollable 4K laser TV is another example of a TV designed to preserve the aesthetics of your living room.\nWhether consumers really want to go to the trouble of hiding their TV every time they finish using it is a different question altogether. It may turn out to be one of those features where it's nice to have the option, even though the TV stays out 99% of the time.\n7. Hisense 110UX ULED\nHisense's 110UX TV features a 110-in ULED display and it also comes with a newly-revealed Hi-View Engine X AI processor. The TV's AI chip can perform screen enhancements such as dynamically adjusting contrast and depth ratios and the screen comes with a 4.2.2 channel speaker with Dolby Atmos FlexConnect support.\nNot only that, the company says the 110UX has 40,000 backlight zones, which is a first for the industry. It also reaches 10,000 nits of brightness, making it one of the brightest TVs at the CES. The 110UX's combination of incredible brightness and AI advances may give it an edge over competitors.\n8. The TCL QM891G\nWith 5,000 nits of peak brightness, TCL's QM891G isn't quite as bright as the Hisense 110UX. That's still very bright, though, and the 115-inch screen is the largest mini-LED TV there is, according to TCL.\nSo while TCL's QM891G might not be quite as impressive as some of the other TVs on this list, it still packs a punch and it will likely come at a more affordable price than the Samsung and LG TVs shown off at CES 2024.\nThis year's CES has delivered once again with impressive innovations in TV technologies. If the trends shown off at the tech showcase are anything to go by, we'll all soon be pretending that we don't have TVs at all, only to then unfold or reveal a massive display capable of rivaling some of the most impressive cinemas."

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

LG\u2019s energy-efficient residential and commercial HVAC lineups on show at this year\u2019s event deliver exceptional performance and demonstrate the company\u2019s steadfast commitment to environmental responsibility.\nIn the Air Solution booth, LG is putting the spotlight on several of its cutting-edge HVAC solutions. These include the R32 air-to-water heat pump and furnace, and the Multi F heat pump, both designed for residential applications, and the new Multi V\u2122 i Variable Refrigerant Flow (VRF) solution for commercial use.\nVisitors to the Home Electrification Solutions Zone can get a firsthand look at LG\u2019s R32 air-to-water heat pump, which employs the low Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerant, R32. Meeting the latest refrigerant standards,1 R32 contributes to the solution\u2019s ability to deliver a reliable heating performance at low temperatures. The zone also features the stylish ARTCOOL\u2122 Gallery air conditioner. First unveiled at CES 2023, the distinctive ARTCOOL Gallery boasts the company\u2019s state-of-the-art DUAL Inverter Compressor\u2122 and 3-way indirect flow.\nAdditionally, the Home Electrification Zone highlights LG\u2019s expertise in custom HVAC system design using versatile solutions such as the Multi F heat pump. Compatible with various indoor units and able to adapt to a wide range of buildings and appliances, the Multi F ensures a comfortable indoor environment, even in extreme climates.\nDisplayed in the Home Air and Water Solutions Zone, LG\u2019s Inverter heat pump water heater is an energy-efficient alternative to a conventional electricity- or gas-powered heater.2 It can heat up to 80 gallons of water at a time, providing a large supply of hot water and a dependable performance. LG\u2019s innovative water heater enhances user convenience as well, offering seamless remote control and handy maintenance notifications via LG ThinQ\u2122 app.\nThe company\u2019s Multi-Position Air Handler Heat Pump provides homeowners with a new level of flexibility and comfort, even in cold climate zones. This solution provides optimal temperature control year-round, cooling in the summer and heating in the winter, and can be configured for vertical upflow, downflow, or horizontal left or right installation, fitting seamlessly into your home\u2019s existing setup.\nIn the Commercial Zone, LG is presenting its new Multi V\u2122 i VRF solution, which is designed for use in mid- to high-rise commercial buildings. Equipped with LG\u2019s highly evolved AI engine, the new Multi V i analyzes operational data to enhance comfort, save energy and provide smart diagnosis functions.\nLocated next to the Air Solution booth, the Component Solutions booth illustrates LG\u2019s ongoing commitment to sustainability and energy efficiency. Among the core product components displayed there are the company\u2019s new residential compressors with low-GWP refrigerants, which are already compliant with new U.S. regulations on refrigerant use.1 The booth also features LG\u2019s scroll compressors for the commercial market and the company\u2019s latest HVAC fan motor lineup.\n\u201cOur cutting-edge HVAC solutions at AHR Expo 2024 show that LG is playing a leading role in the global progress towards \u2018electrification,\u2019 and in prioritizing sustainability in HVAC design,\u201d said James Lee, head of the Air Solution Business Unit at LG Electronics Home Appliance & Air Solution Company. \u201cWe will continue to introduce energy-efficient and high-performance HVAC solutions that further solidify our strong position in the global air conditioning market and support LG\u2019s global strategy as a Smart Home Solution provider.\u201d\nVisit LG\u2019s booth (#S8345, #8349, McCormick Place) at AHR Expo 2024 to explore the full portfolio of LG HVAC solutions.\n# # #\n1 The state of California has passed legislation that will ban the use of refrigerants with a GWP over 750 from the year 2025.\n2 LG\u2019s Inverter Heat Pump Water Heater using a DUAL Inverter compressor heats water with an efficiency of 3.93 Uniform Energy Factor (UEF), whereas conventional electric water heater achieves 0.93 UEF, and conventional gas water heater achieves 0.70 UEF.\nLG Opens New Scroll Compressor Production Line in Mexico\nIncreased Manufacturing Capacity to Strengthen Company\u2019s Competitiveness,\nHelp It Meet Growing Demand From North American Businesses\nSEOUL, Jan. 19, 2024 \u2014 LG Electronics (LG) announces the opening of a new scroll compressor production line at its factory in Monterrey, Mexico. The new line bolsters LG\u2019s scroll compressor manufacturing infrastructure, enabling the company to produce more of its acclaimed, eco-conscious solutions while creating a shorter supply chain for servicing customers across North America.\nLG\u2019s decision to establish a production line in Mexico comes at a time when many U.S. heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) manufacturers are facing challenges due to escalating logistical disruptions. The strategic move places an LG scroll compressor production base in close proximity to key North American markets; setting up a production/logistics system that will help the company better respond to regional demand and lessen the impact on customers of factors such as logistic issues.\nLG\u2019s scroll compressors play a major role in the company\u2019s HVAC components business. At AHR Expo 2023 in Atlanta, Georgia, LG showcased its energy-efficient Gen 3 Scroll Compressors for residential air conditioners and heat pumps, as well as large-capacity scroll compressors for commercial system air conditioning.\nDesigned with the future in mind, Gen 3 Scroll Compressors are symbolic of LG\u2019s continuing leadership in HVAC innovation. In anticipation of refrigerant regulations taking effect in 2025,1 and in line with the company\u2019s commitment to the environment and sustainability, the compressors utilize low Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants. With GWPs less than 700 \u2013 far lower than the 2,088 GWP of R410A \u2013 these refrigerants easily meet the newest eco-focused standards for refrigerants. The structure of the Gen 3 Scroll Compressors also helps to ensure compliance with the latest efficiency standards2 by reducing energy waste and heat loss.\n\u201cThe new, state-of-the-art production line in Mexico will enable us to produce more of our eco-conscious scroll compressors and fortify our ability to service the North American market,\u201d said Kim Yang-sun, head of the Component Solution Business Unit at LG Electronics Home Appliance & Air Solution Company. \u201cLG will continue to provide advanced technologies and components to meet the diverse needs of its global customers.\u201d\n# # #\n1 The state of California has passed legislation that will ban the use of refrigerants with a GWP over 750 from the year 2025.\n2 LG\u2019s compressors meet the requirements of the U.S.\u2019s new HVAC efficiency standard, which went into effect on January 1, 2023.\nReinvent Your Laundry Experience With the LG WashCombo\nIn today\u2019s fast-paced world, finding the time to take care of our household chores is no easy thing.

The success of the collection also sparked anticipation for further collaborations between LG and premium designer furniture brands.\nA successful demonstration of the combination of technology and contemporary design, this partnership formed the perfect amalgamation of noble materials and refined finishes with both brands\u2019 products. The LG Objet Collection Pos\u00e9 was on display at 24 BoConcept showrooms across France until the end of last December, providing the perfect opportunity for customers to explore the premium TV that will redefine the ambience of any home. With this event, LG further solidified itself as a brand with a strong sense of aesthetics and points to an optimistic future of collaborative design.\nMore details of this partnership can be found on the LG x BoConcept website.

The team secured three consecutive season victories \u2013 starting from the 2022 summer season through to the 2023 summer season.\nChovy, a gold medalist in the League of Legends event at the 19th Asian Games Hangzhou and the mid-laner for Gen.G\u2019s League of Legends team, praised LG UltraGear gaming monitors saying, \u201cTheir quick response times and high refresh rates provide an advantage in complex in-game situations, enabling more precise control and smoother playmaking.\u201d While very impressed by all of the high-performance options in the UltraGear monitor lineup, Chovy\u2019s personal favorite is the 27-inch UltraGear OLED gaming monitor (model 27GR95GE).\nIn addition to supporting Gen.G team members in their pursuit of championship goals, LG actively collaborates with them in the development of new LG UltraGear gaming monitors. The feedback from professional players helps fine-tune the latest models. The recently unveiled League of Legends-themed UltraGear OLED gaming monitor (model 27GR95QL) offers an incredibly immersive gaming experience with a unique \u2018League of Legends\u2019 aesthetic, and its design was influenced by input from professional players. LG also supports the Gen.G Global Academy by providing ultra-fast gaming monitors (model 25GR75FG) to students aspiring to become esports professionals.\n\u201cIt is such an honor to enter into our fourth year of partnership with LG UltraGear. Since 2021, they have been our partner in innovation, enriching the world of esports for gaming fans around the globe,\u201d says Arnold Hur, CEO of Gen.G Esports. \u201cThey support not only our professional teams, but also the development of the next generation of gamers in the Gen.G Global Academy.\u201d\n\u201cWe are very proud and pleased that LG UltraGear is helping Gen.G players to deliver consistently excellent results in major tournaments,\u201d said YS Lee, vice president and head of the IT business unit of LG Business Solutions Company. \u201cLG UltraGear remains committed to developing high-end gaming products and to supporting the latest gaming technologies, with the goal of delivering a gaming experience that can satisfy all esports players, whether they\u2019re enthusiastic amateurs or top-ranked professionals.\u201d\n# # #\nLG Opens Its First U.S. Factory to Produce Advanced EV Chargers\nTexas Production Factory to Solidify Company\u2019s Position\nas a Trusted EV Charging Solutions Provider\nSEOUL, Jan. 15, 2024 \u2014 LG Electronics (LG) has expanded its electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions infrastructure, opening its first EV charger production factory in the U.S. The new, 5,500-square-meter facility, located in Fort Worth, Texas, will focus on delivering chargers for the North American market and is expected to have an annual capacity of more than 10,000 units.\nThe factory is LG\u2019s first EV charger production site outside of South Korea, where the company last year opened an EV charger manufacturing operation under its affiliated company HiEV Charger.\nLG chose to establish its U.S.-based EV charger production factory in Texas for multiple, strategic reasons, such as the ability to utilize existing facilities. The state also boasts excellent logistics and transportation networks and is home to major operations for companies in industries ranging from automobile manufacturing to finance.\nIn 2023, when announcing the company\u2019s future vision, LG CEO William Cho noted that \u2018Electrification\u2019 would be a major driver of rapid mid- to long-term growth. LG\u2019s entry into the U.S. EV charging market will enable the company to address rising local demand and discover new business opportunities. Strategically and philosophically aligned with several of the energy and environmental goals set out in the U.S. government\u2019s Inflation Reduction Act, the sustainability-focused company is committed to bolstering its EV charger business, and has commenced plans to grow its presence around the world, including in Asia and Europe.\nLG has started assembling 11kW chargers at its Texas factory and will begin production of 175kW fast chargers within the first half of the year. LG also aims to introduce a 350kW ultra-fast charger in 2024, expanding its EV charger lineup to meet the varied needs of customers, especially those operating in areas such as commercial travel and long-distance transportation.\nThe company is quickly earning a reputation as a reliable EV charger provider thanks to its manufacturing capabilities, quality control and after-sales service. Through emphasizing its differentiated offerings, including control and advertising solutions, LG is confident that the EV charging solutions business will continue to improve its market position over the mid- to long-term.\nFurthermore, LG intends to tap into the diverse EV charging demands of various businesses and facilities, such as hotels, shopping malls, retail stores, gas stations and parking garages, to drive future growth. LG\u2019s B2B experience in the U.S. hotel TV and digital signage sectors provides valuable insight that is expected to aid in the U.S. expansion of the company\u2019s EV charging solutions business.\nThe global EV charging market is expected to grow to USD 186 billion by 2030, according to Roland Berger, a global management consulting firm. The market expansion is being driven by several factors, including the ongoing implementation of regulations aimed at protecting the environment and the continuous progress of vehicle electrification.\n\u201cBy establishing our EV charger production factory in Texas, we will be able to actively respond to the rapidly growing demand for EV infrastructure in the U.S.,\u201d said Jang Ik-hwan, president of the LG Business Solutions Company. \u201cLG is dedicated to delivering uncompromising quality and will offer customers reliable EV charging solutions that combine efficient charger units with advanced control systems.\u201d\n# # #\nInnovations Lifting Customer Experience on Full Display at CES 2024\nFrom January 9-12, LG displayed its newest innovations at CES 2024 under the theme of \u2018Reinvent your future.\u2019 This meticulously curated booth, featuring zones across various spaces, demonstrated LG\u2019s expansion beyond the home into new areas, such as mobility and commercial spaces, in its journey to become a \u2018smart life solution company.\u2019\nLet\u2019s take a look at some of LG\u2019s cutting-edge products introduced at CES 2024, designed to make life better not only for customers but the earth as well.\nBefore entering LG\u2019s booth, visitors were welcomed by the familiar hues of LG Active Red, a signature color for the company. The entrance featured two large displays showcasing the company\u2019s Life\u2019s Good brand promise incorporating new creative elements aimed at resonating with younger audiences, infusing the brand with a touch of youthful exuberance. This preview set the stage for an exploration of how LG\u2019s advancements in technology are poised to enhance the customer experience to, ultimately, make life better.\nThe spotlight of the show was the LG SIGNATURE OLED T, the world\u2019s first 77-inch 4K wireless transparent TV \u2013 a truly spectacular innovation unlocking new possibilities. The massive media art display, comprised of fifteen 77-inch LG OLED Ts seemingly floating in the air, highlighted the TV\u2019s ability to move freely without being constrained by wires or cords \u2013 a feat made possible by the Zero Connect Box.\nIn the \u2018Life with OLED T\u2019 zone, created in collaboration with premium Dutch lifestyle brand Moooi, LG presented how the LG OLED T can redefine the screen experience, liberating the space and transforming into a design object to open a realm of possibilities like never before. The TV\u2019s Transparent Mode enables it to blend with the surroundings, transcending the traditional dominance of a television and becoming a part of interior design. When it\u2019s time to view content, users simply have to raise the black screen to enjoy the exemplary LG OLED picture quality to the fullest.\nThe zone also featured other TVs, including the Pos\u00e9, a lifestyle TV from the LG OLED Objet Collection, which also elevates the home as an object of d\u00e9cor.

Unveiled for the first time at CES, the LG gram Pro 2-in-1 is the newest model that takes the ultra-lightweight, compact design and powerful performance that LG gram is known for to the next level. Next to the LG gram Pro, visitors had the opportunity to try out the newly unveiled LG MyView Smart Monitor, equipped with LG\u2019s webOS platform, providing access to OTT streaming services, home office applications and various content, all without the need for a PC connection.\nLG\u2019s smart TV platform, webOS, provided a wealth of entertainment and engaging experiences, aligning with LG\u2019s objective to transform into a media and entertainment platform company. Inviting users to explore the world of entertainment powered by webOS, the \u2018webOS Experience Zone\u2019 comprised numerous self-lift OLED displays playing an endless stream of content from webOS content partners. Placed at the end of the tunnel, the 97-inch LG OLED M stood as LG\u2019s first 4K 144Hz wireless TV, powered by Alpha 11, the world\u2019s first processor dedicated to OLED. This innovative technology played a crucial role in ensuring lifelike picture quality and immersive, space-filling sound by adapting to the viewer.\nNext, the \u2018Smart Home\u2019 zone highlighted CEO William Cho\u2019s insights shared during LG World Premiere, where he introduced the concept of redefining AI as \u201cAffectionate Intelligence.\u201d To offer visitors an idea of the rich ecosystem created by LG products and connected through ThinQ, the zone was filled with a wide variety of LG appliances equipped with AI-supported intelligent sensors, optimized to study and analyze users\u2019 unique life patterns to generate data that can be used to train LG\u2019s AI.\nAt the zone, visitors were able to witness a demonstration of LG\u2019s smart home AI agent, an all-around home manager and companion that showcased the company\u2019s commitment to realizing the vision of a \u201cZero Labor Home.\u201d The AI agent, featuring an advanced \u2018two-legged\u2019 wheel design, autonomously navigates through the home. Leveraging multi-modal AI technology, it possesses the capability to comprehend context and intent, enabling seamless communication with users.\nAfter exploring LG\u2019s TVs and home appliances, visitors moved on to see how LG is expanding into new spaces, starting with mobility. Introduced at IAA Mobility in September 2023 and showcased for the first time at CES 2024, LG Alpha-able proposed a future mobility experience where vehicles transcend mere transportation functions, evolving into spaces for efficient use of time and diverse experiences.\nThe zone also featured the EV Charger section, demonstrating LG\u2019s capabilities as an integrated solution provider in the mobility space, with LG e-Centric standing as the company\u2019s solution for the optimal operation and efficient management of EV chargers.\nTransitioning to the \u2018Commercial\u2019 Zone, attention shifted to LG\u2019s B2B products.

The company aims to overcome challenges, such as persistent market and supply chain uncertainties, and accelerate growth by building a high-performance, results-oriented organization with a winning spirit.\n\u201cIf 2023 was the year in which we set the direction for new changes, we will make 2024 the year in which we truly accelerate these changes,\u201d said CEO Cho. \u201cFuture Vision 2030 is our promise to the market and to our customers, and we will strive as a company to deliver on this promise.\u201d\nAnnounced by the CEO last year, Future Vision 2030 is LG\u2019s long-term goal to transform into \u2018Smart Life Solution Company\u2019 that can connect and expand the customer experience across various spaces, including home, commercial, mobility and virtual.\nStrengthening Future Competitiveness Through Investment\nCEO Cho set \u2018Break through Limits\u2019 as the key phrase for, and underlying philosophy of the company\u2019s management policy in 2024. Having already established three focus areas for future growth \u2013 a non-hardware business model, B2B expansion and the development of new businesses \u2013 LG will now make an all-out effort to further refine its portfolio.\nTo start with, the company will maximize the potential of its future growth engines by expanding investment based on the strategic priorities of the business. This year, the company will more than double its level of investment; putting USD 8 billion* into R&D and other critical areas to strengthen competitiveness, moving forward.\nHigh-growth and high-profit core businesses will also see larger investment in 2024. These include B2B businesses, such as vehicle components, HVAC, built-in appliances and digital signage, as well as the webOS platform business. LG will continue to invest in new businesses, such as electric vehicle (EV) charging and robotics, and has already announced plans to invest more than USD 40 billion* by 2030 to transform its portfolio for qualitative business growth.\nFurthermore, beginning this year, LG will actively seek inorganic growth opportunities, such as mergers, acquisitions and partnerships, in addition to adopting strategies designed to invigorate its internal growth engines. Emphasis will also be placed on game-changing areas of technology that add customer value, such as AI and mixed reality (MR).\nThe CEO identified the newly established Overseas Sales and Marketing Company as a valuable asset for helping LG \u201cbreak through limits.\u201d Already playing an important role in LG\u2019s global success, the new organization accounted for approximately two-thirds of the company\u2019s total sales. The Overseas Sales and Marketing Company implements specialized strategies that take into consideration the unique characteristics of each region and market. Its efforts have maximized the performance of the business, worldwide, and have played a significant role in strengthening the capabilities and growth of LG\u2019s international subsidiaries.\nAchieving \u2018Triple Seven\u2019 Goals for Growth, Profit and Value\nWith platform-based service businesses, the B2B business and new businesses as its three, main growth engines, the company aims to reach its goal of \u2018Triple Seven\u2019: an average growth rate and operating profit of seven percent or more, as well as enterprise value that translates to an EBITDA ratio of seven.\nLast year, despite a decline in market demand, the company performed impressively thanks to the growth of its B2B business. Over the past five years, the compound annual growth rate of LG\u2019s B2B businesses has easily exceeded double digits, with the average annual growth rate of overall sales reaching around eight percent.\nThe Vehicle component Solutions (VS) Company has likewise emerged as a key business for LG, achieving annual sales of USD 8 billion* in its 10th year of existence. The global transition to EVs is expected to increase the demand for high-value EV parts, one of the VS Company\u2019s core areas of expertise.\nBased on the three pillars of in-vehicle infotainment (IVI), e-powertrains and vehicular lamps, the VS Company is projected to enjoy continuous, rapid growth. From 2024, it will focus primarily on securing software-defined vehicle capabilities, expanding its EV parts customer-base, and strengthening its leadership in smart lamps. To respond to the increasing number of new orders, the company will invest in boosting production capacity in Central America, South America and Europe.\nThe HVAC business, another important part of LG\u2019s B2B portfolio, is growing quickly in emerging markets such as Asia and Central and South America, while in advanced markets, including Europe and North America \u2013 where demand for high-efficiency, eco-friendly products is strong \u2013 it continues to uncover new opportunities.\nLG\u2019s HVAC business aims to leverage the competitiveness of its technologically advanced components, such as motors and compressors, to expand its product lineup. After establishing a consortium for advanced heat pump research in Alaska, U.S.A., last November, LG plans to build an R&D base in Europe this year. The company also intends to broaden its business with the introduction of differentiated air conditioning products, such as the Dedicated Outdoor Air System.\nRecognizing that B2B companies are impacted less directly by the economy than B2C companies, LG is actively bolstering its B2B business as a means to maintain sales and profit stability. The company has announced plans for the expansion of its B2B businesses, and is seeking to raise sales volume to more than USD 32 billion* (double the current level) by 2030 through launching a variety of new, value-added solutions.\nLG will also fast-track the evolution of its overall business model, entering non-hardware areas, such as content, services and subscriptions, to complement its existing product-centric home appliance and TV companies. Leveraging the hundreds of millions of LG products already in use around the world as \u2018platforms,\u2019 the company expects to generate continuous sales and profits.\nIn line with this shift in business direction, the Home Entertainment (HE) Company aims to become a media and entertainment platform company and accelerate the growth of its webOS platform business. The HE Company is rapidly reinforcing the foundations of its platform business by expanding the webOS ecosystem to include smart monitors, IVI systems, and other TV makers. LG expects the webOS platform business to become one of the most potential growth engines \u00a0in the near future.\nThe Home Appliance and Air Solution (H&A) Company, whose success is playing a preeminent role in supporting LG\u2019s organization-wide transformation, is also developing a smart home solution business that combines services and subscriptions. The H&A Company\u2019s ultimate goal is to deliver on its \u2018Zero Labor Home, Makes Quality Time\u2019 vision, which goes beyond home appliances to make homelife smarter and more convenient than ever.\nThe subscription business, encompassing \u2018daily\u2019 services that augment LG\u2019s home appliance products, has been growing at a fast pace in South Korea. The overseas expansion of the subscription business is underway, with strategic markets in Asia the first outside of Korea to experience its many benefits.\nThe percentage of LG\u2019s total sales accounted for by its non-hardware businesses \u2013 such as the webOS platform-based content and service business, and the home appliance subscription business \u2013 has more than doubled over the past five years.\nAdditionally, LG will aggressively promote the commercialization of intangible assets, such as its standard essential patents in critical areas of technology including communications, media, mobility and IoT connectivity. And, during its recent reorganization, the company established new business entities to commercialize its know-how in the construction of smart factories.\nMoreover, LG will secure growth opportunities offering high potential and a high degree of business synergy. As a prime example, the LG NOVA will increase its startup promotion fund to more than USD 100 million by the end of 2024, enabling the company to help discover new technologies and solutions to drive future innovation, and to lead new business segments.\nLG\u2019s recently created EV charging business is emerging as a comprehensive EV charging solutions provider, boasting advanced charging units and control solutions, remote diagnosis and servicing capabilities, as well as vehicle battery diagnosis and robust manufacturing and sales infrastructure. Entering the North American market, the company has completed the construction of a charger production line in Fort Worth, Texas, U.S.A.\nIn the digital healthcare segment, the company is expanding its telemedicine business in cooperation with Amwell, and will also review the viability of offering services in areas such as prevention, diagnosis, post-management and recovery. In virtual reality, another promising business area, LG is preparing for the commercialization of MR devices. At the end of 2023, the company established an eXtended Reality business unit within the HE Company, and is continuing to collaborate on augmented reality solutions with various technology partners.\nIn addition, the company\u2019s Chief Technology Office (CTO), which leads the development of future technologies, is conducting intensive R&D programs to strengthen business competitiveness and discover new core technologies. In particular, the CTO is focusing on eight areas of technology: software, system on chip, AI, robotics, materials and parts, standards, next-generation computing and cloud/data.\nAccelerating DX Through Data-Driven Practices and Next-Gen ERP Investment\nThrough digital transformation (DX), LG will provide customers with F.U.N. \u2013 First, Unique and New \u2013 experiences, and further enhance its customer-centric management system.\nThe company is making large-scale IT investments to establish DX across the entire organization. On top of this, LG is building N-ERP, or Next-generation Enterprise Resource Planning, to seamlessly integrate and link the company\u2019s business processes and systems. Intellytics Customer 360, a customer data platform that enables integrated management of data gathered from diverse customer contact points, will be rolled out globally from this year.\nLG\u2019s DX efforts extend beyond the innovation of the customer experience to the improvement of value chain efficiency; from purchasing and manufacturing to delivery and sales. Last year, by applying DX to each value chain, LG raised productivity and efficiency to the value of more than USD 240 million.*\nTransforming Into a High-Performing Organization and Spreading \u2018Life\u2019s Good\u2019 Values and Philosophy\nWhen speaking with employees, CEO Cho often quotes noted American management scholar, Peter Drucker: \u201cCulture eats strategy for breakfast.\u201d The CEO truly believes that a strong organizational culture is essential to turning strategy into good performance.\nDuring his \u2018CEO F.U.N. Talk\u2019 with employees last December, Mr. Cho outlined the company\u2019s vision for 2024, which includes becoming a high-performing organization. He stated that, \u201cTo accomplish this, we need to intricately connect our mission, vision and goals, and have a relentless focus on execution.\u201d\nUnited under the brand promise of Life\u2019s Good, a variety of integrated brand activities, spanning marketing, ESG and CSR, will be initiated starting this year. The company will spread the values and philosophy that underpin Life\u2019s Good with the spirit of a brave optimist, while also infusing the brand with a youthful dynamism. A self-professed \u2018brave optimist,\u2019 LG is an innovator that daringly faces difficulties, believes in pursuing opportunities for improvement, even during tough times, and finds solutions by listening and paying attention to its customers and the market.\nVisitors can experience LG\u2019s latest innovations at its CES booth (#16008, Las Vegas Convention Center) from January 9-12.

The company\u2019s AI-powered smart home utilizes various sensors to not only digitize people\u2019s lives but also proactively detect needs as well as propose tailored solutions based on customers\u2019 words, actions and even emotions.\nFor example, the non-contact sensors installed in the house can measure and digitize customers\u2019 heart and breathing rate, analyzing their health status to automatically adjust the indoor temperature and humidity.\nIn the future smart home, LG ThinQ will connect sensors and IoT devices installed throughout the home, acting as a service platform that autonomously controls the devices to ensure ideal settings without the need for customer intervention.\nIf, perhaps, a customer brings home a new pet cat, the microphones, cameras and mmWave sensors embedded in household devices detect the furry friend\u2019s presence, automatically asking whether to download the \u2018pet mode\u2019 on LG ThinQ UP home appliances or recommending accessory kits specifically for pets. Additionally, the sensors even prioritize energy efficiency by switching smart products in unoccupied rooms to power-saving mode or turning them off when no one is home. The sensors can even activate crime prevention mode, sending notifications through the LG ThinQ app if any unusual activity is detected.\nThe zone also introduces the newly unveiled smart home AI agent, which moves on its own two wheels to welcome visitors. This AI agent serves as a versatile household assistant and a smart hub, offering comprehensive support in customers\u2019 daily lives by connecting and managing household appliances and IoT devices. Equipped with a camera, speaker and a range of home monitoring sensors, it can gather real-time data of the home environment to facilitate appliance control. Its front display allows for expressive facial expressions, actively engaging and communicating with customers.\nThe commercial zone showcases a variety of customized services connected under the theme of traveling in Las Vegas. One notable example is the integration of LG MAGNIT, a Micro LED Display, with facial recognition and AI advertising solutions. This combination allows for personalized advertisements to be delivered to users in various locations, such as hotels, retail spaces and transportation areas. Other scenarios include customers receiving guidance from the GuideBot at a hotel or making payments through facial recognition at a cafe.\nAlpha-able, LG\u2019s Future Mobility Concept\nGoing beyond the home, LG recently redefined future cars as a \u201cpersonalized digital cave.\u201d To demonstrate this concept, the company established a dedicated zone featuring Alpha-able within its exhibition space. Alpha-able serves as a tangible representation of LG\u2019s mobility vision, offering passengers a preview of the innovative solutions they can expect to experience in the future mobility environment.\nThe future mobility concept aims to deliver unique customer experiences based on three themes: Transformable, Explorable and Relaxable. By transforming the car into spaces reminiscent of home or office environments, passengers can find rest or work on the go. Alpha-able utilizes cutting-edge display technologies, including rollable, flexible and transparent displays, along with LG\u2019s unrivaled home appliance technologies and solutions, to provide Transformable experiences that adapt to passengers\u2019 needs. Additionally, Alpha-able offers Explorable experiences by delivering tailored information and content for unique situations, as well as Relaxable experiences for passengers to unwind and enjoy some personal time.\nIn addition to Alpha-able, LG has also dedicated a zone to showcase its electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions, a key growth area for the company. This zone highlights LG\u2019s EV charger and control solution called e-Centric.\nExperimental yet Innovative LG Labs and Sustainable Solutions Aligned Under ESG Vision\nLG also unveiled a range of new products developed through LG Labs, the company\u2019s experimental yet innovative product and services development project focused on creating unique customer experiences.\nThe LG Labs zone showcases a range of innovative products, including DukeBox by LG Labs, the all-in-one audio device seeking to reinvent the depth of audio and video experience with a modernized jukebox concept; DUOBO by LG Labs, a capsule coffee machine that extracts two flavors at once; and Bon Voyage by LG Labs, a customized living space designed to extend the life quality at home to nature. In addition, the zone includes products like LG CineBeam Qube and brid.zzz by LG Labs, which offer bold and innovative approaches to elevate the customer experience.\nThe company also set up the Better Life for All zone, dedicated to highlighting its efforts in environmental, social and governance initiatives. A notable feature in this zone was the LG mycup, a tumbler washer that made its debut at CES. Furthermore, LG presented its sustainable home solution, leveraging the capabilities of LG\u2019s home energy platform to optimize energy management and utilization. This comprehensive solution offers users efficient usage, easy control and the ability to distribute renewable energy.\nIn addition, LG presented its \u2018Universal UP Kit\u2019, a range of accessories designed to assist all users in conveniently operating LG home appliances, regardless of gender, age or disabilities. Visitors had the opportunity to experience these accessories firsthand. The company also placed a strong emphasis on accessibility for everyone through its TV accessibility experiences.\nVisitors can experience LG\u2019s latest innovations at its CES booth (#16008, Las Vegas Convention Center) from January 9-12.

The LG SIGNATURE OLED T is a true technological marvel, combining a transparent 4K OLED screen and LG\u2019s wireless video and audio transmission technology to transform the screen experience in ways that have never been possible before. The OLED T unlocks a world of near-limitless potential, giving users the unprecedented freedom to meticulously curate their living spaces. This is complemented by the class-leading picture quality and performance of LG OLED, powered by the new \u03b1 (Alpha) 11 AI processor. A genuine game changer, LG\u2019s transparent OLED is the winner of five CES 2024 Innovation Awards, including a Best of Innovation honor.\nLG SIGNATURE OLED T liberates users from a dominant black screen that competes with the d\u00e9cor in their home. Maintaining its 77-inch screen size, OLED T and its innovative transparent display seamlessly harmonizes with its environment. Practically invisible when turned off, it blends into the environment and frees users from the long-standing problem of what to do with the \u2018big black screen.\u2019 The TV\u2019s beautiful see-through screen also helps to make one\u2019s space feel larger, providing a sense of openness.\nThe unique LG OLED T brings with it many new possibilities, from where it can be placed in the room, to the kinds of user experiences that LG can now deliver.\nIts transparent OLED screen removes the usual constraints that come with conventional TVs. No longer does the TV have to be placed against the wall. Instead, users can place the OLED T in the middle of the room to become a divider or prop it against the window without blocking the view outside. The included Zero Connect Box, which leverages LG\u2019s cutting-edge wireless transmission technology to send 4K images and sound to the OLED T, also enables users to place their TV anywhere, regardless of where the electrical outlets are located in the room. With no cables between the Zero Connect Box and the OLED T, users can enjoy a clean, cable-free viewing environment.\nWhat\u2019s more, the modular design of the LG OLED T facilitates diverse installation methods. The OLED T comes in stand-alone, against-the-wall or wall-mount options. Customers can further customize by adding standing or floating shelves on either or both sides of the screen to best suit their unique tastes and preferences.\nLG\u2019s transparent OLED lets owners discover new forms of entertainment and use via its dual viewing experiences: transparent and opaque. The OLED T becomes a transparent digital canvas for showcasing artwork, videos or photos with the Always-On-Display (AOD) feature. Content displayed on the transparent screen appears to float in air, yet simultaneously fuses with the surrounding space to create a compelling and atmospheric visual effect. Another option is the T-Bar feature that offers a helpful info-ticker running along the lower part of the screen. The T-Bar displays news alerts, weather updates or the title of songs being played while the rest of the screen presents a clear, unobstructed view of the space behind it.\nFor viewing in picture perfect OLED, simply click a button to raise the contrast screen. In this way, users can instantly switch to take full advantage of LG OLED\u2019s enhanced picture quality through the new \u03b1 (Alpha) 11 AI processor with 4-times greater AI performance. This provides a 70 percent improvement in graphic performance and a 30 percent faster processing speed compared to its predecessor. OLED T offers the best of both transparent and vibrant-color screen experiences with just a click of a button.\n\u201cAn incredible feat of consumer-driven innovation, LG SIGNATURE OLED T offers brand-new screen experiences plus the picture quality and performance of our award-winning OLED technology,\u201d said Park Hyoung-sei, president of the LG Home Entertainment Company. \u201cLG\u2019s transparent OLED gives customers greater freedom to curate their living spaces, completely redefining what\u2019s possible and pointing the way to an exciting future for the television industry.\u201d\nThe stunning LG SIGNATURE OLED T will be on show during CES 2024 from January 9-12 at the company\u2019s booth (#16008, Las Vegas Convention Center).

Having gained a rich understanding of global consumers and their living spaces for close to seven decades, the company is now going beyond the home, expanding its business into diverse spaces including mobility, commercial and virtual. In every arena, the company aims to improve the customer experience by focusing on five key elements dubbed 3C2S: Care, Connectivity, Customization, Servitization and Sustainability.\nAI Redefined as \u2018Affectionate Intelligence\u2019\nIn its journey to innovate and elevate the customer experience, LG has identified AI as one of the most essential enablers of success. Rather than fixating on the evolution of the technology itself, LG is dedicated to demonstrating how AI can provide tangible benefits in the real world.\nThe company redefined AI as \u201cAffectionate Intelligence,\u201d revealing a belief that AI can foster a customer experience that is more caring, empathetic and attentive.\nReal-Time Life Intelligence\nDuring the press conference, CEO Cho highlighted the unique characteristics of LG\u2019s AI solutions, starting with its capacity to harness a wealth of data, in both scale and quality. Among the 500 to 700 million LG products currently in use worldwide, there are many smart devices equipped with AI-supported intelligent sensors that are optimized to learn and analyze users\u2019 \u2018physical\u2019 and \u2018emotional\u2019 life patterns.\nWhereas many companies rely on internet-based data to train their AI, LG has the advantage of being able to draw on \u2018real life\u2019 data gathered from billions of connected devices, encompassing LG smart products and a wide range of IoT devices. This dataset can provide valuable insight into customer-device interactions, as well as customers\u2019 environments, behavior patterns and emotional states. This multi-faceted data can also give the company a more complete picture of its customers\u2019 lives at home, enabling the delivery of better and smarter lifestyle solutions.\nOrchestrated Intelligence With LG AI Brain\nCEO Cho went on to explain the integral role played by the LG AI Brain, a powerful processing engine driven by LG\u2019s large language model. Leveraging the company\u2019s vast repository of user data, the AI Brain forecasts customers\u2019 needs based on user-product interactions and contextual learning, performs advanced reasoning processes and generates optimal solutions through orchestrating the actions of physical devices.\nUltimately, this allows the company to provide intelligent services and experiences for the various spaces in customers\u2019 lives, all delivered in a more intelligent and efficient manner, showcasing the attentiveness embedded in LG\u2019s concept of Affectionate Intelligence.\nCommitment to Responsible Intelligence\nLG is acutely aware of its responsibility to employ AI in an ethical manner and is dedicated to being accountable for the impacts and consequences of its decisions and actions. The company aims to develop AI systems that benefit all users, promote safe behavior and ensure the security of all collected personal data.\nHighlighting this commitment is the company\u2019s robust data security system, LG Shield, designed to protect personal data and information at every stage of the process, from collection and storage to utilization. Dedicated to realizing Responsible Intelligence, LG aims to surpass required industry benchmarks for the implementation of AI.\nIn his concluding remarks at LG World Premiere, CEO Cho emphasized that LG\u2019s approach to AI is firmly rooted in the belief that customers should have full control. He also added, \u201cLife\u2019s Good. This is our solid and uncompromising promise that motivates us to create a better life for our customers, even in the age of AI.\u201d\nAt the event, CEO Cho was joined on stage by Jung Ki-hyun, vice president and head of LG\u2019s Platform Business Center, and Eun Seok-hyun, president of LG Vehicle component Solutions (VS) Company, who introduced AI-based innovative technologies and strategies.\nStarting with the home, vice president Jung presented a blueprint for LG\u2019s AI-based smart home. In line with the vision to transform into a smart life solution company, the company is incorporating LG\u2019s unique \u2018Affectionate Intelligence\u2019 technology into the ThinQ platform. Mr. Jung not only unveiled innovative new services, such as \u2018ChatThinQ,\u2019 a generative AI chatbot that enables natural conversations with customers, and \u20183D Home View,\u2019 a 3D visualization of the home for integrated control of spaces in an intuitive way, but also revealed plans to launch a new smart home hub.\nAnd, in mobility, the company shared its vision for cars as a \u2018living space on wheels\u2019 powered by software-defined vehicle (SDV) solutions. In line with this vision, Eun Seok-hyun, president of LG VS Company, introduced LG AlphaWare, the company\u2019s suite of software solutions for SDV. LG AlphaWare includes versatile software modules to enhance existing vehicle operating systems and to assist in building new platforms; operation solutions to help software developers throughout the SW development process from design to deployment; in-cabin entertainment solutions that enable high definition content viewing and high quality sound; and human-machine interface solutions that utilize AR/MR and AI technologies to provide an immersive in-vehicle experience.\nVisit LG\u2019s dedicated CES site (www.LG.com/CES2024) and the LG Global YouTube channel for more information on what the company has in store for CES 2024, and to keep up with all the latest news during the event (January 9-12).\n# # #\nLG Releases Preliminary Earnings for Fourth-Quarter 2023\nSEOUL, Jan. 8, 2024 \u2014 LG Electronics Inc. (LG) today announced its preliminary earnings results for the fourth quarter and full-year of 2023.\nLG reported an annual consolidated revenue of KRW 84 trillion, marking the third consecutive year of achieving the highest annual revenue, and an annual operating profit of KRW 3.5 trillion. These figures demonstrate a resilient business performance, approaching the results observed during the prior period of pent-up demand, despite challenges posed by delayed demand recovery from the economic slowdown as well as heightened market competition.\nThe historic high in annual revenue can be attributed to the robust fundamentals of LG\u2019s core businesses and the growth experienced in B2B sectors. Notably, the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of LG\u2019s revenue over the last three years stands at over 13 percent. Additionally, the annual operating profit demonstrated a solid performance, reaching levels comparable to the preceding year.\nLG\u2019s effective management performance in the face of a challenging external environment is particularly noteworthy, setting it apart within the industry. Strategic efforts to enhance the business portfolio, including the early identification of market turning points to drive high growth in B2B sectors, played a pivotal role. Business model innovation, such as diversifying from hardware-oriented businesses to platform-based service business, also contributed to maintaining stable profitability.\nIn the home appliance & air solution business, LG is expected to have achieved an annual revenue milestone of KRW 30 trillion. Strategic market approaches, such as expanding volume zone lineups while retaining premium leadership to address demand polarization, played a key role in this success. B2B expansion in areas like HVAC, components and built-in appliances further contributed to overall growth. Going forward, LG will concentrate efforts on strengthening core competencies in product and manufacturing competitiveness, while accelerating changes in business models, including direct-to-consumer (D2C) and subscriptions, to prepare for the future. The company will also accelerate efforts to evolving its smart home solutions, reflecting the value of \u201cZero Labor Home,\u201d by expanding the lineup of home appliances embedded with operating systems.\nThe vehicle component solutions business is anticipated to have exceeded KRW 10 trillion in annual revenue within a decade of its establishment, becoming one of LG\u2019s core businesses. The average operating rate of production facilities has surpassed 100 percent since last year, driving growth. Starting this year, LG will intensify efforts to secure capabilities in the evolving trend of software-defined vehicles while aiming for growth in volume. Leveraging differentiation technologies accumulated in home appliances and IT, the company plans to enhance in-vehicle experiences while accelerating the efficiency and synergy of the entire business, including EV components and headlamps.\nDespite challenges in key markets like Europe, the home entertainment business experienced meaningful growth in webOS content and services. This year, the expansion of the webOS ecosystem will extend beyond TVs to encompass smart monitors, in-vehicle infotainment and other areas, further broadening the business scope. From a product perspective, LG will significantly strengthen both the top-tier OLED lineup and the QNED lineup, following a dual-track strategy to lead the premium market.\nThe business solutions company is concentrating on the early commercialization of key areas such as EV charging and robotics. As a leader in LG\u2019s B2B business, the segment aims to accelerate the shift from supplying single products to integrating and providing adjacent solutions. With a significant proportion of new businesses within the organization, investments are prioritized for future preparations rather than short-term management performance.\nIt is important to note that these figures represent tentative consolidated earnings based on the Korean International Financial Reporting Standards and are provided as a service to investors before LG Electronics releases its final earnings results. The official announcement of confirmed results, including the net profit for the year 2023 and the management performance of each Company, is scheduled for later this month.\n# # #\nLG Accelerates Next-Generation Autonomous Driving and Infotainment Solution\nLG\u2019s Innovative In-Vehicle Infotainment Capabilities Combine With Magna\u2019s Cutting-\nEdge ADAS and AD Technologies in Companies\u2019 Latest Collaboration\nSEOUL, Jan. 4, 2023 \u2014 LG Electronics (LG) will hold a private demonstration for major automakers at CES 2024, introducing a new cross domain platform integrating Advanced Driver Assistance System (ADAS), Automated Driving (AD) and In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI) technologies. Developed by LG in collaboration with Magna, a global mobility tech company, the game-changing future mobility platform is expected to arrive on the market in the near future.\nInitiated in 2023, the collaboration leverages the combined technological prowess of LG and Magna, to help deliver differentiated user experiences in the vehicle cabin. The two companies have successfully integrated a cross domain cockpit computing system into a single System on Chip (SoC) representing a flexible and cost-effective solution for OEMs.\nThe single electronic module supports multiple IVI systems and ADAS/AD domain integration, and can efficiently handle various Automotive Safety Integrity Level (ASIL) requirements while using fewer electronic control units and taking up less packaging space. This scalable solution is ideal for the coming transition towards the Software-Defined Vehicle (SDV) and for the consolidation of its electrical/electronic architecture. The integration of functionalities into a single module enables the real-time sharing of rich data across domains.\nVia a dedicated Human Machine Interface (HMI), LG\u2019s platform can provide drivers and passengers with compelling, new experiences \u2013 and more intuitive interactions \u2013 when using advanced automotive displays, digital clusters, Augmented Reality-Head Up Displays (AR-HUD) and visualization software. Additionally, the solution can be customized to meet any OEM\u2019s integrated communications and IVI system needs. 2027 model year vehicles are expected to be the first to benefit from this advanced technology.\n\u201cWe are extremely pleased with the progress we have made on this future mobility technology,\u201d said Eun Seok-hyun, president of LG Vehicle component Solutions Company. \u201cLG and Magna\u2019s joint efforts will help push the industry forward, facilitating the rapid adoption of crucial technologies that elevate driving safety and the on-road experience.\u201d\nAnother successful collaboration between the two companies, LG Magna e-Powertrain unites Magna\u2019s expertise in electric powertrain systems with LG\u2019s capabilities in component development for e-motors, inverters and on-board chargers. Announced in 2021, the joint venture, which encompasses engineering, design and manufacturing, enables LG and Magna to proactively respond to market trends and deliver innovative solutions to fulfill customers\u2019 evolving needs.\n# # #\nMore LG Smart TV Owners Set to Enjoy the Latest webOS Upgrade, Making Their TVs Feel Brand New\nComing to Earlier LG Smart TV Models, webOS Re:New Program Gives More Users\nAccess to the Elevated Home Entertainment Experience Most Recent Platform Provides\nSEOUL, Jan. 4, 2024 \u2014 LG Electronics (LG) announced that it is offering the latest upgrade* of the webOS smart TV platform to owners of older LG Smart TVs, effectively evolving their smart TV into the ultimate home entertainment hub.\nIn early 2024, the webOS Re:New program will bring the latest webOS upgrade to every model in LG\u2019s 2022 OLED TV lineup, LG OLED Flex, LG OLED Objet Collection Pos\u00e9 as well as LG\u2019s 2022 QNED Mini LED 8K (QNED99/95 series), promising users the joy of a new TV experience for the next five years.
