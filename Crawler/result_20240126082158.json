Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

This year\u2019s theme is Human Security for All, which emphasizes the critical role technology plays in making the world safer and more sustainable for everyone, encompassing topics from environmental protection to healthcare access and food security. With keynote conversations featuring leaders in technology, consumer goods and healthcare spaces, CES 2024 invites us to consider how we can come together to engineer solutions that solve global human security issues.\nIn the opening keynote, Siemens AG CEO Dr. Roland Busch will kick off these conversations by revealing how combining the real and digital worlds empowers manufacturers everywhere to transform the everyday, for everyone. Throughout the four-day event, we\u2019ll dive into the various ways that Siemens technology is helping our customers make the world more accessible for all, with one of the key areas being the medical device industry. Read on for a sneak peak of what awaits at CES and discover more ways that Siemens digital solutions are reshaping the medical device and healthcare industries.\nUnlimited Tomorrow: Breaking barriers in access to prosthetics\nOur booth at CES will highlight multiple customer success stories from across industries. One story we\u2019re excited to share comes from Unlimited Tomorrow, a manufacturer of personalized, affordable prosthetic arms.\nThe traditional process of creating prosthetic limbs is costly and can take up to a year. For users who are children and may still be growing, this process can leave them with a prosthetic that no longer fits at the time of delivery. Using Siemens NX software, Unlimited Tomorrow is able to drastically shorten the time it takes to create a prosthetic. Unlimited Tomorrow makes it easy for users to order a prosthetic from the comfort of their home using a scan app on a mobile device. Once the scans are received, Unlimited Tomorrow designs a man/machine \u201csocket\u201d to fit the prosthetic to the patient\u2019s partial arm, 3D prints the prosthetic and ships it to the customer. They typically receive their lightweight prosthetic arm five times faster than the traditional process.\nHow additive manufacturing is reshaping the medical device industry\nUnlimited Tomorrow isn\u2019t the only example of how additive manufacturing can be used to transform the medical device industry and elevate patient care with high-quality, durable products. Additive manufacturing makes it possible to easily develop custom prosthetics, implants and orthopedic surgical guides that are as unique as the patients they serve.\nSimilar to the process of producing prosthetics, custom orthopedic surgical guides can also be created from patient scans and developed individually. Surgical cutting guides are used to limit cuts to a specific area, allowing surgeons to make precise cuts when removing a diseased or injured area of a bone before inserting a replacement. Traditionally, surgeons would use patient scans to determine the position and location of the cuts, then estimate what size of cutting guide is necessary. During the operation, they would then make the final decision about the size and position of the guide, selecting from a collection of generic sizes.\nWith additive manufacturing and modern design software, surgeons can use the same patient scan data to mold the cutting guide\u00a0to the shape of the patient\u2019s bone and virtually place it in the exact position necessary to make the most precise cut. The end result? Less invasive surgeries and faster recovery times for patients.\nAdditive manufacturing is also broadening the types of implant materials available. Traditional implants used in procedures such as knee replacements are bonded to the bone using a cement adhesive. This adhesive will gradually weaken over time, often leading to an implant replacement later down the line. Several companies are now using metal-based lattice structures to promote bone growth into knee, hip and shoulder replacements.\u00a0Lattice structures are three-dimensional arrangements of a material at a small scale. They form a scaffold-type structure that is lightweight yet strong. Medical companies including LimaCorporate have designed lattice structures that can integrate directly with new bone growth when used as implants. Unlike cement, this bond actually grows stronger over time, leading to long-term durability.\nEnhancing digital health security\nMedical devices are becoming a daily part of our lives, whether it\u2019s a patient using a device that connects to their cell phone to help manage a chronic condition, or healthcare professionals managing healthcare workflows. These devices make our lives easier and more connected, but they collect sensitive information that must be handled carefully. In order to protect patient safety and confidentiality, it\u2019s imperative that medical devices are secured against bugs and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nSiemens Connected Care solutions equip medical device manufacturers with tools to improve the safety, quality and performance of their products. With our low-code application development platform, Mendix, and a robust cybersecurity framework, manufacturers can work collaboratively to build devices that enhance user experience and create apps for all forms of interaction \u2013 handheld to augmented reality. For the best user experience, our solutions improve device functionality and future-proof the software to ensure smooth upgrades.\nVisit Siemens at CES\nAre you attending CES 2024?

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nMonitoring People's Health Was A Notable Theme At CES 2024\nNew tech devices for health-monitoring populated the aisles of CES 2024.\nLast week, I mentioned in my Consumer Electronics Show columns that this January show was my 49th winter CES. In a small way, I have become a historian of this event. That has led people who know about my history of attending the show to ask how CES has evolved since I first attended it in the late 1970s.\nWhen I first went to CES, the focus was on VCRs and large hand-held video cameras. It even had a shady side, as the early adopters of VCRs were the adult entertainment industry. Many vendors who had new VCRs and video cameras to hawk, and even unrelated product companies would hire Playboy and Penthouse models and even porn stars to sign autographs in their booths to attract buyers. Interestingly, this was the origin of the \"booth babes\" term that was part of the CES vernacular until the show banned this practice in the late 1980s after it received significant criticism for this practice. This era was decades before flat-panel TVs and the more advanced technology we see at the show today.\nHowever, its evolution in the past 10 years has made CES a catchall show in tech that now includes smart cars, smart homes, health and fitness, advancements in televisions, streaming video, high-end gaming and just about anything that has a tech angle to a product or service.\nHowever, the one new area that CES has focused on that is a huge deal is the area of health, fitness and, more importantly, health monitoring.\nClose to 100 booths and private rooms showed products in this category. I admit that as I age, health, fitness and health monitoring have become more important to me, but it is an area that everyone should be interested in to stay healthy and fit.\nWith that in mind, here are a few of the products I saw this year that got my attention.\nWithings BeamO\nDemocrat Goldman Introduces Censure Resolution Against GOP\u2019s Stefanik For Calling Jan. 6 Defendants \u2018Hostages\u2019\nGovernment Shutdown Deadline Expected To Move To March\nEnroll Now For Early Student Loan Forgiveness, Says Biden: How To Apply\nDigital health company Withings announced its BeamO \"multiscope,\" a device that can perform four health checks in under a minute.\nThe BeamO fuses the capabilities of a thermometer, electrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope in an at-home checkup device. It is a multiscope that can do more than a fitness watch.\nBeamO combines these specialized sensors to turn their device into a powerful tool for regularly monitoring heart and lung health. It is portable and smaller than a smartphone.\nBeamO's design is to help individuals and families perform at-home checkups and substantially improve the quality of telehealth visits.The aim is to let people do more tests at home and talk to doctors on remote calls about the results, advancing the efficiency of telemedicine.\nStelo by Dexcom\nI have been a Type 2 diabetic for 27 years and have to monitor my blood sugars constantly. I am also insulin-dependent and use the Dexcom G7 CGM to help me determine my insulin dosages. Dexcom has now launched a new product that should be available later this year called the Stelo.\nWhat's different about the Stelo is its design for Type 2 diabetes patients who don't need insulin. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% or more of diabetes cases, yet these people don't always have a clear idea of which foods spike their blood sugar and what to do about it.\nFor someone on insulin, knowing their blood sugars is a life-and-death issue. For those not using insulin, learning about their blood sugars and how certain foods impact their blood sugars is a health issue that can help prevent their diabetes from getting worse. Abbot has a similar product called the Lingo Glucose Monitoring Biosensor. Both are essential tools for people with diabetes to manage this disease proactively.\nUltraHuman Smart Ring Air\nThere were many smart rings at the show, but the UltraHuman Ring Air is the only smart ring that uses fighter jet titanium that I have tested that monitors sleep, movement, recovery, nutrition and many fitness tracking data points. It has a six-axis motion sensor delivering accurate data and is water-resistant at a depth of 330 feet. I met with them at the show and was allowed to test it during CES. I found the sleep data better than the fitness tracker I wore at the show, and its step counter was very accurate.\nVivoo\nVivoo is a home testing tool that uses urine to diagnose nine important health-related data points. The company calls it a wellness platform that gives real-time data on water, magnesium, calcium, vitamin C, PH, keytones, sodium, oxidative stress and protein. A one-time purchase, which includes four Vivoo tests, is $39. They also offer monthly subscriptions for people who want or need to test more often to monitor these data points regularly.\nThis test highlights this new category of home health monitoring that has emerged to allow people to be more proactive in managing their health. This category includes smartwatches, fitness trackers, etc. Indeed, I saw at least 25 new smart health watches, fitness trackers and other health monitoring devices, including highly portable blood pressure tools and other health-related wearables.\nAlthough many dedicated medical shows have highlighted these health monitoring products, CES has become the leading consumer technology show in North America, where health has become a significant focus of this yearly event."
