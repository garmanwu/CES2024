Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

Israeli tech firm iRomaScents is hoping to help you avoid embarrassing situations with technology that will allow you to smell movies, TV shows and video games.\nPhoto by iStock/GoodLifeStudio\nBy Adam Kovac\nJanuary 9, 2023\nHave you ever been watching a movie and had a burning desire to sniff Ryan Reynolds? An Israeli tech firm is working to make that a reality.\nOn Sunday, the annual Consumer Electronics Show wrapped up in Las Vegas. During the four-day expo, hundreds of companies showcased their wares, with products running from Elon Musk\u2019s Boring Company demonstrating their supposed transport tunnel system of the future to the latest in smart home appliances. But Israeli firm iRomaScents may have had the most unusual ideas on display.\nFounded in 2019, iRomaScents plans to introduce \u201cthe next generation of scented movies & commercials.\u201d On its website, the company says it has plans for three applications of the technology. Retail applications will provide a \u201csmarter way of shopping for fragrance,\u201d the company says.\nForwarding the News\nThoughtful, balanced reporting from the Forward and around the web, bringing you updated news and analysis of the crisis each day.\n\u201cBuying an aftershave today is a long process, at the end of which, after smelling several products, shoppers just give up and leave the store,\u201d founder and CEO Avner Gal told CTech. \u201cWe are able to provide the consumer, according to their requirements and preferences, with the smell of the product that suits them best alongside three different alternatives, and the possibility that they will make a purchase is much higher.\u201d\nThe other two applications will allow audiences and gamers to get more immersed than ever in movies, TV shows and video games. At last, film buffs will be able to smell the sweat as Tom Cruise runs through his next Mission: Impossible.\nAlthough arguably the funkiest, iRomaScents was just one of dozens of Israeli tech firms on display at CES. Other companies included CORRactions, which produces tech that monitors subconscious movements to determine a person\u2019s cognitive state; SavorEat, which offers on-demand vegetarian meals prepared by a robot chef; cutting-edge carseat company babyark, as well several autonomous driving technology and other mobility firms.\nAn official Israel Pavilion displayed the best of the country\u2019s latest developments in artificial intelligence, vehicle safety, digital health and other technology.\nRelated\nAdam Kovac is a staff reporter at the Forward, covering breaking news.

Or, imagine you\u2019re traversing an old dungeon in a video game and a musty odor fills your nostrils.\niRomaScents believes that it can elevate the experience of TV, movies, and video games with the added dimension of scent. Its device, which looks like a regular humidifier, contains up to 45 different scents that can be released on demand.\nDirectors can add them to movies or commercials, just like a regular video editor would add music to a\nscene.\nThey simply select the aroma they want, drag it onto the timeline, and it will automatically be triggered at that point in the movie. The device holds a refillable store of 5,000 \u201cwhiffs\u201d.\n\u201cVisitors were so excited from our iRomaScents device and the different applications,\u201d said Co-founder and CEO Avner Gal.\n\u201cThose who experienced our retail application were amazed about the ease of use, and immediate result they get, leading them to the most suitable product.\u201d\nThe company says in the future it aims to provide perfume shoppers with sample fragrances online.\nNext-generation dice, Rubik\u2019s cubes, and chess sets\nFrom binge-worthy Netflix shows to video games with stunning graphics, entertainment is shifting to an almost entirely digital medium \u2013 and board games are quickly becoming a thing of the past.\nParticula has combined the two, blending the online and offline worlds with its smart-connected dice, Rubik\u2019s cube, and chess set.\nIts electronic dice connects with a companion app, turning a tablet into an interactive board game with tons of games for the family, games for adults, and educational games.\n\u201cIt is our goal to empower kids especially to enjoy games away from screens through the medium of smart-connected toys,\u201d said Udi Dor, Co-founder and CEO.\nSign up for our free weekly newsletter\nEach dice is equipped with 3D sensors, wireless connectivity, a colorful light system. It needs just 10 seconds of charge for two hours of gameplay.\nIts smart cube connects to any mobile device and tracks the player\u2019s moves in real time, and its companion app has a battle mode to compete with friends or strangers, and participate in live competitions.\nTrain your reflexes with \u201cSimon Says on steroids\u201d\nImprove your workout \u2013 and brain processing power \u2013 with a fitness accessory reminiscent of the children\u2019s game Simon Says.\nBlazePod is paving the way for fun, competitive and cognitive exercises with light-up pods attached to suction cups. The small LED pods blink on and off in eight colors according to pre-set patterns to guide the user\u2019s flash reflex training routine.\nUsers can attach the pods to a punching bag, then punch them when they flash green, or kick them when they flash red. It can also bring a fun element of competition to workouts, as\nathletes try to smack their respective pods as many times as they can in 60 seconds \u2013 all while doing core-strengthening planks.\n\u201cMy mission in creating BlazePod was to motivate, educate, and inspire the world to think quicker and perform better by offering a revolutionary training experience,\u201d said Yaniv Shneiderman, the company\u2019s Founder and CEO.\nHe says using BlazePods during workouts can improve agility, balance, coordination, reaction time, and strength.\nGrow your own vegetables with an \u201cindoor wine cooler\u201d\nMany of us dream of growing our own vegetable garden, but find our crops wilting from too much or too little sun and rain.\nThe AgwaGarden \u2013 which looks like an indoor wine cooler \u2013 guarantees amateur gardeners perfect crops every time.\nIt\u2019s powered by artificial intelligence to grow vegetables more predictably and more consistently than anything planted in the field.\nThree cameras and an array of sensors collect data twice a day to adjust the temperature, humidity, light and water levels for all the plants. And because it\u2019s a closed system, there\u2019s no need for pesticides.\nThe indoor gardener simply places capsules of their desired vegetable into empty slots, refills the machine with water as necessary and harvests the veg within three or four weeks, as instructed by notifications sent to their smartphone.\nThe AgwaGarden can grow up to 60 plants at once, including eight varieties of lettuce, greens like kale, chard, arugula, and bok choy, and a variety of herbs and spices.\n\u201cWe monitor your plants twice a day remotely, and collect all of this data to our cloud service, which is today based on human agronomists\u2019 knowledge and AI.

This year, there are just 10.\nWhile there are always additional Israeli exhibitors at the show independent of the pavilion (such as Nuance and Foretellix), representation is definitely smaller this year.\nWe see that as a glass-half-full kind of thing, transforming these few brave companies into bigger fish swimming in a slightly smaller pond.\nISRAEL21c takes a look at what will hopefully not be staying exclusively in Vegas in 2024.\nARTI\nApple is due to release its highly-anticipated Vision Pro augmented reality (AR) glasses soon. These high-tech goggles will allow wearers to watch 3D movies, take video calls, record movies and interact with their computers without a keyboard and mouse.\nARTI is jumping on the AR bandwagon with tools to add 3D graphics to a video stream \u2013 no hardware or design skills needed. ARTI combines live video with its 3D cloud rendering to create a real-time mixed reality scene that the company says: \u201cwill make any webinar, Zoom call, Twitch stream, sales or training video three times more engaging and 70% more memorable.\u201d\nCarteav\nWhen San Francisco banned most of Cruise\u2019s self-driving car tests in October 2023, with the local DMV calling them \u201cnot safe for the public\u2019s operation,\u201d it highlighted a dirty secret in the tech space: Full Level 5 autonomy is not ready for primetime yet\u2026 and may not be for at least 10 to 15 years. Less than a month later, Cruise voluntarily restricted its vehicles to \u201cclosed course training environments.\u201d\nThat decision fits into Israeli autonomous vehicle startup Carteav\u2019s mission statement: promoting low-speed vehicles to transport people and goods in regulation-free, privately run areas such as resorts, retirement villages, airports, gated communities, university and hospital campuses, and car-free zones (such as dedicated busways).\nCarteav\u2019s hardware and software turns electric golfcarts into self-driving LSVs (\u201clow speed vehicles\u201d) which you can order using a mobile app. The service is being tested in senior communities in Israel and soon in Turkey, too.\nCorrActions\nYou\u2019ve had too much to drink. Or maybe you didn\u2019t sleep the night before. Both represent cognitive states of impairment that should prevent you from getting behind the wheel. But who\u2019s going to stop you?\nIsraeli startup CorrActions enables the car itself to state, \u201cSorry, mate, tonight you should take a taxi home.\u201d\nCorrActions can determine cognitive states such as fatigue, inattention and anxiety, as well as alcohol or drug influence, by monitoring data from the motion sensors already in the car \u2013 starting with the steering wheel.\nOur bodies generate micromotions we\u2019re not even aware of, CorrActions CEO Ilan Reingold told ISRAEL21c. These come from electrical brain activity that affects the motor cortex. These same electrical signals can \u201cleak\u201d out, resulting in unconscious micromotions that sensors, like those in a steering wheel, can detect.\nThe company already has partnerships with Volkswagen and Hyundai.\nEZinGrow\nGrowing food at home used to be complicated. Not anymore. EZinGrow has developed a controller that, when attached to the bottom of an off-the-shelf pot, turns it into a \u201csmart habitat\u201d that can control a plant\u2019s growing parameters. A remote phone or tablet application helps home farmers tweak each pot\u2019s growing plan.\nThe service runs in the cloud, so EZinGrow is able to compare your pot with all other pots it\u2019s seen; home growers don\u2019t need to have any horticulture experience or prior knowledge. The pot controller, which runs on rechargeable batteries, operates irrigation and lighting according to the growing instructions.\nEZinGrow says its patented product is \u201ccurrently in the final stages of product development.\u201d\nHailo\nHailo develops specialized AI processors that enable high performance AI applications on edge devices \u2014 cameras and other types of hardware that operate on the \u201cedge\u201d of your computer network and in autonomous vehicles, smart homes, retail environments and security, among other sectors.\nThe Hailo-8 edge AI processor, for example, is blazingly fast, at 26 tera-operations per second. Yet the processor itself is smaller than a penny. The Hailo-15 is a full system-on-a-chip for smart cameras and AI vision processors.\nWhen the company was founded in 2017, AI was only available in expensive data centers. Hailo\u2019s mission is to move that computing power out of the data center and onto the edge. Significantly, the company raised a $136 million Series C round in 2023.\niRomaScents\nYou\u2019re watching a movie and it starts to rain on screen. Wouldn\u2019t it be great if you could smell the wet leaves? Or you\u2019re shopping for perfume online \u2013 is there a way to get a whiff of the scent without visiting the perfume counter at the closest mall?\nIsraeli startup iRomaScents, which is returning to CES for the third time, has developed a device loaded with up to 45 fragrances that can be released on demand. Each device can store over 5,000 \u201cwhiffs\u201d \u2014 iRomaScents\u2019 terminology for the odors it emits.\nThe iRomaScents tech can be \u201cpencil-beamed\u201d so that the smells reach a specific viewer. For creators, an \u201ceditor\u201d lets you add scents to a video.\nIt\u2019s not just for the movies or the mall: A home device could help consumers enjoy a cooking program in a delicious new way.\nNimble Beauty\nYour nails are looking ragged, but you have no time to get to the salon. Israeli startup Nimble Beauty brings the nail salon into your home. Using robotics and AI algorithms, the Nimble Beauty system scans, paints and dries your nails autonomously.\nIt\u2019s a huge market \u2013 worth $60 billion globally. In the United States alone, 100 million women paint their nails on a regular basis.\nDuring Nimble Beauty\u2019s 2021 Kickstarter campaign, some 5,000 devices were ordered generating $2 million in the first month.\nOperation is relatively simple: insert three capsules into the machine, put your hand inside and push the start button. A tiny robotic arm applies a base coat, two layers of color and a topcoat. Warm air dries each coat. The robot completes each hand in about 10 minutes. Suggested retail price for the unit is $399 with a set of three polish capsules costing another $10.\nResight\nMark Zuckerberg has bet big on the metaverse \u2013 even rebranding the parent company he runs from Facebook to Meta. But will Meta\u2019s future focus be able to staunch the flight of young users to other social media platforms? That depends in part on what content the company will offer in its version of the metaverse.\nAnd for that, Meta is going to need Israeli startup Resight. Resight is \u201cbuilding a visual index of the world, linking users, apps and augmented reality (AR) content to physical locations.\u201d Resight calls these replicas \u201cdigital twins.\u201d\nResight crowdsources data from its users to build a 3D map of the physical world onto which can be embedded AR images, text and video. Resight allows creators to overlay 3D virtual \u201cobjects\u201d on the scene \u2013 say, a bouncing blue monster \u2014 that will still be there when the next user enters the metaverse in the same location.\nVisionary.ai\nDo your phone or camera photos look poor in low light or at night? Whether from a home camera or a professional application, images and video have always appeared worse when there\u2019s not enough light available.\nEnter Israeli startup Visionary.ai, which applies computer vision and artificial intelligence to improve the quality of images and videos. That should help with facial recognition, too \u2013 for example, when you try to unlock your iPhone in the dark. Visionary.ai\u2019s product features blur and noise reduction, improved HDR performance and enhanced object recognition.\nVisionary.ai\u2019s partners include Qualcomm, Synopsys, Cadence, NVIDIA, and CEVA. Initial target markets include transportation (cameras on buses and bus stops), drones and mobile devices.\nVisual Layer\nAs companies amass sprawling databases of images and video, exploring, visualizing and curating such a large amount of non-text data requires unparalleled speed.\nThat\u2019s what Visual Layer does. Its software can automatically understand your data; bring to the surface possible negative events; and fix data quality issues.\nVisual Data started by offering a free open-source tool, fastdup, which signed up more than 320,000 users in its first year alone and has now processed more than 50 billion images.\nVisual Data says that by using its software, customers can save up to 95% of the labeling costs for billions of images and videos and can accelerate development by up to 20%. Visual Layer customers include Honeywell, Jerusalem-based Lightricks and Meesho.\nMore on Innovation\nRead more:\nMore on CES\nRead\nAbout\nJoin\nFollow"

Another key question will be around attendee numbers, which recovered post-pandemic to 115,000 visitors in 2023, according to show organiser, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).\nCES 2024: What to expect\nHere we\u2019ll take a look through a selection of the biggest media and tech launches at the show, some of the key trends, and what impact these are likely to have throughout the coming year.\nCES has always been a key moment in the AV calendar, when the biggest manufacturers in panels come together, promote their various enhancement technologies and announce the newest ranges. With Samsung, LG, Sony, all vying for the same space, there will be some serious innovation on show. The big news will be in the 100-inch TV segment (a fact that was also true way back in 2019), but there will be plenty of OLED and Mini-LED activity too, as well as a slew of transparent displays from both LG and Samsung in particular, which look to be moving from the prototype stage of former years towards a more production-ready design.\nLG\u2019s new OLED lineup makes much of an updated Alpha 11 AI processor that offers four times the performance of last year\u2019s models, upscaling objects and backgrounds to reduce blur and claims to analyse and adjust colours to \u201cbest convey the mood and emotional elements intended by filmmakers.\u201d While the resolution remains at 4K, refresh rates have increased to 144Hz.\nRead more\u00a0The Best Stories of IBC2023\nSamsung, meanwhile, is sticking to the \u2018bigger is better\u2019 UHD playbook, with two new 8K TV lines at CES, along with an 8K home theatre projector. The Neo QLED QN900D relies on Samsung\u2019s 8K AI Upscaling Pro image processing engine to convert 4K content into 8K, and also upscale lower-res content to 4K. The flagship QN900D supports variable refresh rate (VRR) at up to 240Hz, while the QN800D offers a 120Hz refresh rate and no AI upscaling.\nSeparately, Samsung Display has also teased that the 2024 QD-OLED TV panel will be capable of \u201cutilising advanced panel drive technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve a maximum brightness of over 3000 nits. This makes it the brightest OLED TV panel available\u2026\u201d The new S95D QD-OLED TV also features an unusually competent glare-free display that minimises reflections.\nThe projector market continues to diversify too, with Xgimi\u2019s Horizon Max - claimed to be the world\u2019s first IMAX Enhanced long throw projector, debuting at CES2024. The projector follows last year\u2019s Xgimi Horizon Ultra, the world\u2019s first Dolby Vision-compatible long throw projector. Both devices have Google TV onboard, ensuring they\u2019ll be relatively plug-and-play.\nOf course, the battle for eyeballs is not restricted to the living room, with the world of esports commanding vast engagement. In clear recognition of this market, LG is demonstrating what it claims is an \u2018industry first\u2019 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display, an ultra-high refresh rate coupled with the fastest response time (0.03ms) of any panel on the market today.\nCES 2024: LG Display unveils industry\u2019s first 480Hz QHD gaming OLED display\nLG Display is set to launch the 27-inch 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display during the first half of the year. The company will unveil its full lineup of Gaming OLED displays in sizes 27, 31.5, 34, 39, and 45 inches at CES 2024 as it announces its entry into the high-end gaming display market.\n\u201cTo strengthen our leadership in the high-end gaming display market, we will continue to harness the power of OLED\u2019s distinctive qualities such as ultra-high refresh rates, fast response times, and perfect black for next-level viewing experiences,\u201d said Won-seok Kang, Vice President and Head of the Large Display Product Planning Division at LG Display.\nMeanwhile, gaming brand Razer is promising two gaming world firsts at CES2024, in the shape of a brace of laptops with a 18-inch 4K display that\u2019s capable of running at up to 165Hz and a 16-inch 240Hz OLED respectively.\nAlso worthy of note is Acer\u2019s Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition, which offers glasses-free 3D at a more affordable level than ever before - though whether this will attract developers and buyers is another matter.\nInterestingly, LG is also tackling the content side of the equation, displaying a\u00a0new lineup of \u2018LG MyView\u2019 smart monitors. The monitors have\u00a0webOS platform\u00a0baked in, so that users can stream content and listen to music without connecting to a PC, and feature\u00a0LG IPS 4K displays to boot.\nThey might not be new technologies, and certainly the hype around mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) has proved to be a slow-burner, but 2024 is set to be the year of XR. With Apple\u2019s Vision Pro set for launch early in the year, the market will be on tenterhooks to capitalise on the renewed interest, which will also centre around the Qualcomm XR2+ Gen2 VR chip. That chipset is apparently at the heart of a Samsung/Google XR headset, of which much is rumoured and little known for sure, but a launch date of late 2024 is often mentioned.\nUnsurprisingly, AI is set to be a key player at CES2024 - \u2018front and center\u2019 as the organisers put it, with examples from exhibitors as diverse as Garmin, Intel, Qualcomm and Walmart - the latter three likely to incorporate AI into their respective keynotes. Other touchpoints include a presentation on \u2018Great Minds, Bold Visions: What\u2019s Next for AI?\u2019, \u2018Emerging Technologies Shaping the Tech Workforce\u2019 and research that will outline \u2018Technology and AI Building a Sustainable, Secure, Superior Future\u2019.\nAI may be big business, but the classic Asimov-era artificial intelligence requires a humanoid automaton, which might not be particularly practical, but always steals the show, as Tesla has proved several times, most recently with the Optimus 2.\nCES2024 will star the Kepler Humanoid Robot, a 178cm (5 \u201910\u201d), 85kg (187 lbs.) humanoid bot with a dexterous hand capable of 12 degrees of freedom. Kepler\u2019s series of humanoid robots are apparently poised to enter mass production and commence shipping in Q3 2024, priced at approximately US$30,000.\nCES has long been a guiding light in the automotive tech sphere, and 2024 looks to be no different, with Honda announcing that it will be showing off new EVs at the event. Toyota and Hyundai are likely to make a splash too.\nCES 2024: LG M4\nOne announcement from set-top boxes (STB) and smart TV software firm 3SS features the integration of Dolby Atmos into an automotive entertainment platform, 3Ready Automotive, highlighting the potential applications for immersive entertainment in-vehicle.\nThe CES2024 demo will feature German VOD service maxdome\u2019s Dolby Atmos-enriched programming and will allow automakers to bring premium studio content via maxdome to all their cars with streamlined technical integration and certification. The Dolby Atmos-capable 3Ready entertainment platform can be deployed and scaled across Android Automotive OS, Linux, QNX and AOSP (Android Automotive Open Source Project).\n\u201cTogether with Dolby and 3SS, we\u2019re enabling carmakers to bring the latest premium video content to their customers with the most immersive audio experience,\u201c commented Hans D. Henseleit, CEO at maxdome.\nAs well as big tech names, a selection of media industry stars are also set to shine at the show, with the prospective cast including Robert Downey Jr, Game of Thrones Producers David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss, Blake Griffin and Ryan Kalil of Mortal Media, Chiara and Bianca D\u2019Ambrosio of Mirror Image Films, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, content creators from T-Pain to Wu-Tang Clan, Ludacris and almost inevitably, Will.i.am.\nRead more\u00a0What to Expect in 2024: Womens Sport Bid Wars, AI and the Olympics\nTopics\nAdvertisement\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nRelated articles\nCES2024 Review: What We Learned\n2024-01-18T13:31:00Z\nBy Mark Mayne\nThe established bellwether of the tech industry, CES2024 has delivered in its usual frenetic style.

Getting in touch with a local window installer is the best way to get an accurate cost estimate for your home.\nHow Installing Energy-Efficient Windows in Ashburn Saves You Money\nThere are several benefits of switching to energy-efficient windows. A few reasons you may want to consider making the switch include the following:\nEstimated Cost of Window Replacement in Ashburn\nWindows come in different styles, purposes and shapes, so costs and services will vary remarkably depending on several factors. Below, we go over the average cost and services that you'll find from window installation companies.\nHow Much Do New Windows Cost?\nAccording to our research, the national average cost to replace a single window is around $600. However, window replacement costs can range from $200 to $1,200 a window. But costs will vary significantly depending on your location, the number of windows you need, the current condition of your home and the quality of your products. Many window companies also offer door installations and other add-ons like shutters, coating, baths and more. These extra services will increase your overall project costs.\nWhether or not you want to install energy-efficient windows is another factor that will determine the cost. These will almost always cost more than other windows, but on the other hand, you can save about $353 a year on your energy bills in Ashburn.\nGetting free quotes from multiple companies is the best way to find out which one will work best for your budget.\nWhat Services do Window Installers Offer?\nThe first step when planning a window replacement is to decide whether you want a full-frame or pocket installation.\nFull-frame installations involve replacing the whole window \u2014 the sill, frame, trim and all. These are most common when you want to change the style of your window or when it has significant deterioration. Full-frame installations are more time-consuming and will increase overall costs. A pocket installation involves replacing a window within the frame that's already there. So, instead of tearing out the whole window and rebuilding it, the contractor will just put the replacement window (also called a retrofit or insert window) into the frame.\nYour window installation company should be able to help you choose which type of installation you should get.\nBest Availability\nBest Energy-Efficient Features\nWindow Veteran\nHow We Choose the Best Window Installers in Ashburn\nIn our hunt to make your home improvements easier and more eco-friendly in Ashburn, EcoWatch landed on the above companies as the best window installation companies in the city. Along with energy efficiency, we reviewed window companies all across the state and ranked them based on the following methodology:\nService Area\nBecause this is a guide for Ashburn, we only included companies that cover the city. There are other reputable providers that didn't make our list because of the low odds that they would serve the average homeowner in Ashburn.\nWork Quality\nWe're certain that you're looking for professionals who do a great job installing windows. We've vetted each installer included in our guide to ensure its technicians are well-qualified and that the company has received plenty of positive customer feedback to vouch for its service.\nCustomer Reviews\nAnother self-explanatory yet very important review factor is customer feedback. If most customers don't have positive things to say about their experience with a certain company, you won't see it featured on EcoWatch.\nCost\nCheaper windows certainly don't mean better windows, but we know many of our readers want to keep costs as low as possible. When analyzing the prices of providers, we awarded higher scores to companies with reasonable prices and accessible financing rather than \"cheaper\" services.\nWarranty\nProtecting your investment in new windows is important. For that reason, window installation companies that give you lengthy warranties for products, parts and labor rank higher with EcoWatch.\nYears of Experience\nBecause of Ashburn's climate, homeowners need to be wary of water damage, rot and low efficiency. We factored in local experience to reflect the ability of Ashburn window companies to prepare homes for the climate.
