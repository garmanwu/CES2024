        "raw_content": "Belkin brought a lot of new chargers to CES 2024, and they look fantastic\nBelkin is supercharging its accessory lineup at\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0with a new lineup of wireless charging accessories and smaller, more powerful wired chargers \u2014 all thanks to two relatively new technologies being embraced by the popular accessory maker.\nThanks to the new Qi2 standard, Belkin is releasing a new BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand that will provide universal 15-watt wireless charging support and the BoostCharge Pro Magnetic Power Bank, which delivers more power for on-the-go charging needs.\nOn the wired front, a new 200-watt charger promises enough juice to safely top up to four USB-C devices simultaneously in a remarkably compact form factor. There\u2019s a compact 6-in-1 laptop dock as well.\nBoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand\nBelkin\u2019s BoostCharge Pro stands\u00a0are some of the most elegant and popular charging solutions for iPhone users with multiple devices, and the new BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand is no exception.\nIt follows the same design as the company\u2019s iconic MagSafe stand with a handy twist \u2014\u00a0literally. The charging pad is now adjustable to nearly any angle, from laying your iPhone flat to propping it up perpendicular to your desk or table.\nThis is facilitated by an adjustable hinge that\u2019s conspicuously absent from every MagSafe stand we\u2019ve ever seen. We\u2019ve generally assumed it\u2019s something forbidden by Apple\u2019s MagSafe certification requirements, forcing users to choose between an adjustable stand and the fastest 15W charging.\nHowever, Belkin\u2019s new stand doesn\u2019t need to follow Apple\u2019s rules, as it now uses modern Qi2 charging with the open-standard Magnetic Power Profile (MPP) that can deliver 15W charging to any compatible iPhone \u2014 that\u2019s any iPhone 15 or iPhone 15 Pro or an iPhone 13 or iPhone 14 running iOS 17.2 or later.\nAs with Belkin\u2019s other stands, the new BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand also offers an Apple Watch charger that supports fast charging for the Apple Watch Series 7 or later\u00a0and the Apple Watch Ultra series, as well as an optimized charging pad for your AirPods or other wireless earbuds.\nThe BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand will sell for $150 and be available in select markets worldwide in March.\nBoostCharge Pro Magnetic Power Bank\nIn the same vein as Belkin\u2019s new magnetic stand, the company has also unveiled a Qi2 MPP magnetic power bank under the same brand that\u2019s capable of delivering up to 15W of wireless power to iPhone 13 or later models and other Qi2-compatible devices.\nAn integrated kickstand lets you prop up your phone for watching videos or reading on the go, and like other magnetic battery packs, it\u2019s compatible with MagSafe cases.\nThe BoostCharge Pro Magnetic Power Bank will be available in 5,000mAh, 8,000mAh, and 10,000mAh options for $60, $80, and $100, respectively. It also supports passthrough charging via the USB-C port so that you can juice up the power bank and your smartphone at the same time. It\u2019s coming in March to select markets worldwide.\nBoostCharge Pro 4-port USB-C GaN Charger\nOn the wired side, Belkin is taking advantage of relatively new gallium nitride (GAN) technology to produce some of the smallest and most powerful wired chargers and docks it\u2019s ever made.\nFirst up is a 4-port USB-C GaN Wall Charger that packs 200W of power \u2014 enough to let you fast charge up to four devices simultaneously. For example, it can deliver full-speed charging to a high-powered gaming laptop, with more than ample power left over for your smartphone, tablet, and more.\nThanks to the GaN technology, it\u2019s a deceptively small design given the power it delivers, measuring only 92 by 118.5 by 35.5mm and weighing 650 grams. You can easily tuck it into your laptop bag for use on the go.\nThe BoostCharge Pro 4-port USB-C GaN Charger will sell for $130 and is coming to select markets worldwide in March.\n6-in-1 Core GaN Dock\nBelkin\u2019s new 6-in-1 Core GaN Dock is another example of the miracle of GaN technology. At about 3 inches on each side, this pocket-sized dock provides connections for 4K HDMI and Gigabit Ethernet, as well as two USB-A and two USB-C ports, one of which provides 96W power delivery.\nThe small size means you\u2019ll not only be able to reduce clutter on your desk, but it\u2019s also an excellent solution for taking on the road for use in conference rooms and hotel rooms.\nThe 6-in-1 Core GaN Dock is available now from Belkin.com for $140, and should be coming soon to select retailers worldwide.\nDropping an iPhone through the cracks of the floor sounds like a nightmare for anybody who owns one. David Cogen, founder of TheUnlockr.com, lived this particular nightmare when he dropped his iPhone 14 Plus and it slipped beneath the floorboards during a night out at a bar. Luckily, MagSafe\u00a0came to the rescue.\nCogen shared a video on Twitter on Thursday showing the exact moment he dropped his iPhone 14 Plus through the floorboard at a local bar the night before \u2014 and everyone who attempted to help him fish it out from underneath, including the bar manager, using various tools to no avail. The next day, he returned to the bar, slipped a MagSafe Duo charger through the crack of the floorboard, and successfully fished his phone back to the surface and his hand.\nMany iPhone owners these days have more than just their smartphone to charge up at night. because of Apple\u2019s robust product ecosystem, an iPhone is often joined by an Apple Watch and a set of AirPods, and there\u2019s no shortage of accessories designed to make it easy to manage and charge these devices together.\nSuch is the case with the $130 Ugreen 3-in-1 MagSafe Charging Station, which takes advantage of the MagSafe technology built into iPhone 12 and newer models. Ugreen's charging station holds your phone in place while fast charging it and juices up your Apple Watch and a set of AirPods\u00a0(or other small wireless charge-capable earphones) at the same time. It's an impressive-sounding package on paper. But what's it like to use?\nMagSafe vs. magnetic charging\nWireless charging has become the most popular way for most folks to power up their smartphones, and the Qi wireless charging standard guarantees you\u2019ll be able to charge up from just about any wireless charger you happen upon.\nUnfortunately, if you want the best charging experience and speeds possible, things can get a bit complicated. For folks using Apple\u2019s latest iPhone models, that means getting an Apple-certified MagSafe charger.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

        "raw_content": "Content is created by CNN Underscored\u2019s team of editors who work independently from the CNN newsroom. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn a commission. Learn more\nThis $180 iPhone stand follows you while you shoot video \u2014 and it\u2019s seriously impressive\nCNN Underscored is on the ground at CES 2024 in Las Vegas to pick out the tech products that are actually worth your attention. Be sure to follow our CES 2024 coverage hub for the latest hands-on previews straight from the world\u2019s biggest electronics show.\nWatching people shoot video on the CES 2024 show floor, it was plain as day how annoying filming oneself can get. Constantly futzing with framing and such gets plenty annoying, and Belkin\u2019s in seeming agreement with me on that. Its new Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is the cameraperson you didn\u2019t know you needed \u2014 at least if you own an iPhone.\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nTired of making sure you\u2019re in your own shot while recording video? This iPhone stand makes it super easy and does all the work for you. It even rotates 360 degrees. Belkin says it\u2019ll start taking preorders on this gadget later this month.\nThe first accessory compatible with Apple\u2019s DockKit technology, the $180 Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is a MagSafe-enabled iPhone stand that can track you (and others) with your phone\u2019s cameras. After pairing your iPhone to the stand once, you pop it on the MagSafe puck (where it will \u201cnod\u201d up and down) and it will start following you.\nThe Stand Pro rotates 360 degrees, so it can follow you in whatever room you\u2019ve deemed fit for shooting, and it even tilts 90 degrees, so I could pop a squat. And while the first demo I got with the Stand Pro was primarily focused on the front-facing selfie camera, I later learned the rear cameras work with DockKit as well. All you need to do is tap the button to switch cameras and your iPhone will rotate around on the stand so the better cameras can see you.\nAll the while, the Stand Pro operates silently so it doesn\u2019t interfere with your video recording. All it requires is an iPhone 12 or later (for MagSafe compatibility), and don\u2019t worry about app compatibility, it works with the cameras in every iOS app. So, whether you need to be following on a Zoom or you\u2019re making footage for Instagram, you\u2019re covered. Its internal battery offers five hours of juice on a single charge, so it\u2019s also fit for the field.\nThe takeaway\nIf you\u2019re as excited as I bet you will be, know that Belkin reps told CNN Underscored that the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro will be available \u201cvery soon.\u201d And since it\u2019s built on Apple\u2019s own DockKit tech, you can feel more confident that this feature will be supported by the Cupertino-based tech titan for years to come. We look forward to filming lots of auto-tracked video once this unique stand launches, so stay tuned for more.\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

        "raw_content": "Belkin just announced one of the coolest iPhone accessories I\u2019ve ever seen\nBelkin has announced a new stand at CES 2024 that will take your iPhone\u2019s video capabilities to the next level.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is the first accessory to use Apple\u2019s DockKit, which means it uses the iPhone\u2019s recognition technology to move your iPhone around, keeping you in frame through an enormous range of motion. This incredible new accessory means you can move around freely while on camera, whether you\u2019re shooting the latest TikTok trend or just catching up in a video call.\nThe auto-tracking feature is the headline here and absolutely a reason to stand up and pay attention. Belkin\u2019s stand is the first to use Apple\u2019s DockKit, a revolutionary piece of technology that takes the iPhone\u2019s ability to identify and track objects within the camera frame and translates it into real-world movement.\nPut simply, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro communicates with your iPhone to work together to track you or someone else through the physical rotation of the stand. The Stand Pro has a wide range of movement, a full 360 degrees around the stand and 90 degrees tilt up and down. Positioned well, that\u2019s a wide enough array of movement to accommodate a number of videos.\nYour iPhone is attached to the Stand Pro through MagSafe, which gives it a strong and secure bond. But that\u2019s not the only advantage of the MagSafe connection. You can also use the Stand Pro as a wireless charger with up to 15W fast wireless charging when plugged in with the included 30W charger and five-foot-long USB-C charging cable. Need to film away from a charger? No problem \u2014 the Stand Pro also has a built-in battery that lasts for up to five hours of use.\nNot a creator? It\u2019s still worth considering. The Auto-Tracking Stand Pro works with the iPhone camera, FaceTime, WhatsApp, Microsoft Teams, and other messaging and social media platforms, so it\u2019s great for avid video-callers as well as those who want to create content for Instagram, TikTok, or Canva.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro costs $180 from Belkin\u2019s website, and it will be coming to selected retailers across the world soon.\nCES typically isn't a big show for mobile, but CES 2024 has been a strange exception to that rule. From the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro to futuristic foldable concepts from Samsung, there's been a lot of exciting mobile tech to look at.\nThat also includes Clicks \u2014 a new accessory that essentially transforms your iPhone into a BlackBerry.\nMophie, a brand known for its mobile power accessories, has announced the return of the fan-favorite Juice Pack case for the iPhone at CES 2024. Yes, the Juice Pack is back.\nMophie was the first officially Apple-certified battery case maker and has been around since the very first iPhone. Mophie was acquired by Zagg in 2016. It\u2019s gone through a few variations over time, with the Juice Pack Air and Juice Pack Access in 2019, and then it disappeared for a while. It didn\u2019t help that Apple had its own Battery Case for a while that's now discontinued, but Mophie is making a comeback with the Juice Pack.\nTCL has done the unthinkable at CES 2024. It has announced seven new smartphones to kick off the new year. The TCL 50 Series is the company\u2019s fifth generation of smartphones and includes everything from cost-effective 5G devices to all-new TCL NxtPaper models. This isn't the first time TCL has created a NxtPaper smartphone, but it is the first time we're seeing them come to the U.S.\nTCL says the TCL 50 Series represents its dedication to providing users with various options and a satisfying experience. The lineup features numerous advancements, including an e-reader mode for book lovers and speedy 5G connectivity for those often on the move. Every model in the series has been crafted to offer a smooth entertainment experience, effective productivity, and a comfortable user experience.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."
