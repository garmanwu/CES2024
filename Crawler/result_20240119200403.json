CES truly attracts innovation from around the world.\nThis year, we were not sure about CES, so it was a last-minute decision, yet we hosted an amazing event.\nThis post is a reminder that we reached the end of the show.\nThese 6 days in Las Vegas were full of networking, meetings, and new connections with people around the world.\nApart from this networking, I enjoyed roaming around to see what the world is doing. It's overwhelming to see how seriously some countries are innovating and trying to solve almost every problem humans encounter.\nWe mostly know that China is good at product innovation, but here at CES, South Korea stole the show. They are incredible, I must say, and their product quality is far superior to China at almost the same price point.\nAt the same time, I have struggled to see Indian companies exhibiting, other than just a few. We are mostly selling services and software, not much hardware innovation.\nI believe the government of India must focus on building, subsidizing, and promoting Indian brands on foreign land, which I feel is lacking. I am not sure if government officials visited CES; if not, they must visit next time to see what other countries are innovating.\nIt is necessary for India to work sector-wise, solve real-world problems, and the government must run competitions and subsidize brands that are building world-class, unique, and innovative products.\nAs a country, let's not just replicate what China and other countries have already built or start a business that is popular in the West. Let's do something new that the whole world can take inspiration from.\nHere are some images that conclude CES for SparxIT.\nCES see you next year.\n20,459 followers\nTech talk from Day 3 at #CES2024 featuring our CBO Sumit S Sengar\n#SparxITatCES2024 #SparxITEvents\n20,459 followers\nHappy faces on Day 3 of CES 2024 \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\ufffd\n#SparxITEvents #SparxITatCES2024 #CES2024\n20,459 followers\nTrust building with prospects on DAY 3 at CES 2024 \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\ufffd\n#SparxITEvents #SparxITatCES2024 #CES2024\n20,459 followers\nA busy day with media and prospects on Day 2 of CES 2024 \u00f0\u0178\u201c\u00b8\n#SparxITEvents #SparxITatCES2024 #CES2024\nSparxIT reposted this\nFrom India to Boston: Catalyzing Digital Transformations for Businesses \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Let's Accelerate Your Growth Journey in United States \u00f0\u0178\u2021\u00ba\u00f0\u0178\u2021\u00b8 Together!\nThrilled to announce that I've been selected by the Tech Podcasts Network to go live today at CES!\nIt's an incredible opportunity to share our company's vision with a global audience.
