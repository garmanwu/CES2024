And it has been gathering research on consumers for decades so it can spot the trends that are shaping technology and vice versa. GenZ accounts for about 69 million people in the U.S. and a quarter of the world\u2019s population now. Overall, there are 5.4 billion people on the planet, including 90% of the global GenZ population in emerging markets.\nWhile 92% of the population is online in the U.S., just 46% are online in India, 55% in Nigeria, 73% in China and 87% in the European Union. A billion more people will come online by 2027, the CTA said, and Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink is going to be a big contributor to that. Add to that expectations for 6G wireless as well as the internet of things.\nOne of the things coming, Comiskey said, is Li-Fi, or using light to transmit data. Comiskey said much of the consumer gadget world will revolve around AI and robotics, cloud and cybersecurity. Big topics at the show include AI, sustainability and inclusivity, Boothe said.\nWhile generative AI thanks to ChatGPT is big, AI is going to be bigger than that with chipmakers like Intel, AMD, Nvidia and Qualcomm committing to AI computers and Microsoft announcing its Copilot key as the first new addition to the Windows keyboard in 30 years. Comiskey described AI as a horizontal wave of technological innovation that cuts across all industries.\n\u201cAI is honestly going to be everywhere,\u201d Comiskey said.\nHe noted that nine out of 10 U.S. adults are familiar with AI, and those familiar with it tend to have positive sentiments around AI. But they have concerns about privacy, disinformation and job loss. And 74% believe the federal government should be regulating safety around the use of AI.\nComiskey noted that Siemens will focus its talk on the industrial metaverse, with robotics technology that will be captured in digital twins, where a factory is simulated first and then built in real life. The real-life factory will be instrumented with sensors to refine the design of the virtual factory.\nCTA touted new technologies like lightweight exoskeletons that allow you to lift more weight than you can otherwise. (At CES Unveiled last night, I tried out the Muscle Suit from Innophys, which enabled me to life more weight \u2014 making 25 pounds feel like you\u2019re lifting five pounds. I saw a woman lift a man while wearing the exoskeleton.\nComiskey noted sustainability is both revolutionary and evolutionary as a trend. He noted that nuclear fusion ignition was achieved multiple times in 2023. And he said electric vehicles, renewable power and consumer electronics recycling is pushing forward. The Paris accords on climate change were signed in 2017, and we are halfway to the target of hitting climate change goals by 2030. Some countries are accelerating their efforts to meet targets.\nIn the U.S., $97 billion has been allocated to achieve carbon-free electricity by 2035 and net zero energy use by 2050. To that end, Air Farm from Nit Bar is a smart food that can grow sustainably in deserts.\nBoothe said companies are embracing inclusive tech design, and she noted companies with diverse management teams see 19% higher revenue than other companies. She said there are 1.8 billion people in the world with disabilities, and it\u2019s a market that can be targeted with accessible products.\nCES Unveiled featured a number of products aimed at disabled people. Ives from France showed off the Iris chatbot that can interpret sign language for deaf people. It is dubbed the Iris Signbot. The women\u2019s health market is expected to hit $1.2 trillion by 2027, and there are products like a cooling pad that can detect hot flashes and deliver cooling to the pad in the middle of the night.\nThe speakers noted how CES is the largest mobility show in the world, with tons of electric vehicles on display, including tech for wireless EV charging. Brunswick has an electric otor for boats, and Supernal has a vertiport to show off its design for a flying car. Kia has purpose-built vehicles for tasks like delivery.\nBoothe said that TV will become the intelligent hub from the home where you can control everything in the home\u2019s internet of things ecosystem. LG showed just that this morning.\nThe rise of gaming\nBoothe noted the success of films like The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which generated $1.36 billion at the box office, and TV shows like The Last of Us. Comiskey noted there are 40 TV series and movies based on games in the works, and she noted the rush to remake retro games and bring them to modern graphics. They noted that Newzoo estimates there are three billion gamers around the world.\nThe CTA also noted a shift in revenues for consumer electronics, with 64% coming from hardware and the remainder coming from software.\nThe post The CES tech trends to watch in 2024 | CTA appeared first on Venture Beat.\nTrending Posts\nJason Kelce carries young Bills fan to see Taylor Swift during Chiefs\u2019 playoff win\nFrench tourist finds massive 7.46-carat diamond in Arkansas state park\nBoston, Chicago: Blue Cities Turning Major Airports into Migrant Shelters\nNancy Mace\u2019s Bizarre Jan. 6 Plan: \u2018Get Punched in the Face\u2019\nI moved from Malibu to Vegas and bought a $1.9 million home.

According to Kinsey Fabrizio, CTA\u2019s SVP for CES & Membership, speaking at CTA\u2019s annual CES press preview, this year\u2019s Las Vegas confab (January 9-12) has already surpassed 3,500 exhibitors, has reached 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space, and show organizers expect more than 130,000 attendees.\nWhile encouraging, these metrics still lag slightly behind the last pre-pandemic CES in 2020, which featured 4,400 exhibitors across 2.9 million square feet, and 171,000 attendees.\nThis year\u2019s CES has been dubbed \u201cAll Together. All On.\u201d with a focus on three overarching themes: access to technology, part of CTA\u2019s partnership with the UN\u2019s Human Security for All campaign, the growth and adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI), and CTA\u2019s 100th anniversary.\nWhile 2024 is an election year, CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro doesn\u2019t view CES or technology as a partisan issue. \u201cWe divide the world into two types, not Republican and Democrat or not of those who are against us and those who are for us, but those that have been to CES and those that have not. Those who have been to CES see the world totally differently. They see the promise of innovation\u2026not just from the biggest companies, not even from smaller companies, but also from people and startups with an idea.\u201d\nFabrizio bragged the show will host 800 new exhibitors, \u201cand we\u2019re adding more every single day.\u201d West Hall is \u201cat capacity,\u201d according to John Kelley, CTA VP and CES Show Director, and will be filled with nearly 300 auto and mobility companies including Hyundai and Kia for the first time. C Space is expanding into the Cosmo Hotel, and Shark Tank\u2019s open casting call returns to CES as well with Mark Cuban speaking during the show\u2019s digital health program.\nEureka Park at the Venetian will house 1,000 startups alongside more than 20 country pavilions. Other CES 2024 \u201chot\u201d categories continue to be digital health, including wearable tech, health tracking, telehealth tools, and food tech; this year\u2019s CES Unveiled press event will feature a new tasting area for \u201calternative\u201d foods.\nShapiro also announced two new keynoters, Intel CEO Patrick Gelsinger, and a C-Suite keynote featuring Snap co-founder and CEO Evan Spiegel and MediaLink chair and CEO Michael Kassan. There also will be nearly 1,000 speakers across 250 conference sessions, including 11 policy panels that will focus on \u201csetting the guardrails for the innovation industry to balance the need for innovation,\u201d Shapiro notes, recognizing \u201cthat government has a legitimate interest in making sure things are done in a way that\u2019s beneficial to their country and their needs.\u201d\nOn the show floor itself, show organizers expect AI to be a pervasive force at the CES 2024.\n\u201cGenerative AI has taken the world by storm and every company is thinking about how to use it,\u201d Shapiro asserts. \u201cMany companies are going to be talking about, introducing, and showing products which take advantage of that. Generative AI is going to be a big, big shift forward for humanity.\u201d\nTo help attendees and exhibitors plan for the show, the CES 2024 app is now available.\nSee also: CTA To Start Centennial Celebration At CES 2024\nStewart Wolpin\nFor more stories like this, and to keep up to date with all our market leading news, features and analysis, sign up to our newsletter here.\nTags \u22c5 CES \u22c5 CES 2024 \u22c5 CTA \u22c5 Eureka Park \u22c5 Stewart Wolpin\nFeatured\nVIDEO: The New Age Electronics Outlook\u2014Part 3\u2014with Steve Koenig\nSupply Shortages And Port Delays Driving Holiday Shoppers To Start Early This Season\nBack-to-School Season Means Gearing Up for More e-Learning and Working From Home\n3 New Nationwide Vendor Partners Available To Boost Home Entertainment Experience\nRelated Articles\nCall For Editorial Coverage In The Official 2024 CES Daily\nITRI To Exhibit Innovations Across Industries At CES 2024\nCES 2024: TCL Raises The Bar For 2024\nCoway Receives CES 2024 Innovation Award For BEREX Reclining Massage Bed\nHisense To Showcase \u2018Future Of Display Technology\u2019 at CES 2024\nAARP Reveals AI-Powered AgeTech Programming For CES 2024\nInfiRay Car Night Vision System To Make U.S. Debut At CES 2024\nCyrusher Set to Unveil Cutting-Edge Electric Bicycle Innovations at CES 2024\nZ-Wave Alliance Kicks Off 2024 with New Members, Updated Educational Materials, and CES 2024 Presence\nCES 2024: AI Pioneers Insist That It Is \u2018Here To Stay\u2019\n\u00a9 2024 TWICE is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher."

And, unsurprisingly, the companies producing said new tech devices were unhappy with the prospect of the government laying a hefty levy on an already expensive product, potentially stifling sales as a result.\nSo, on Saturday night, April 19, 1924, six Chicago radio manufacturers got together at dinner and decided to form the Radio Manufacturers\u2019 Association \u2013 RMA. Within three weeks, RMA lobbying killed the fed\u2019s radio tax, and one of the country\u2019s largest and most effective trade organizations \u00ac\u2013 now known as the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) \u2013 was born.\nCES, run by CTA of course, will mark the beginning of a series of centennial celebrations. \u201cFor 100 years, CTA has ignited innovation by leading the tech industry through advocating for innovation-friendly policies, capturing emerging trends in market research, developing consensus standards, and convening innovators to solve some of the world\u2019s biggest challenges,\u201d said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of CTA since 1991. \u201cThe celebration of CTA\u2019s 100th anniversary will be on full display at CES 2024 from interactive photo opportunities to an exciting look at our history and where the tech industry is heading for the next 100 years.\u201d\nCTA\u2019s centennial will be reflected and integrated into a plethora of events at CES, beginning with the show\u2019s theme, \u201cIgniting Innovation Since 1924,\u201d and Shapiro\u2019s CTA State of the Industry keynote on January 9 at 8:30am in the Venetian\u2019s Palazzo Ballroom on level 5. There will be interactive anniversary events at the CTA Center in the LVCC Grand Lobby, a CTA historical timeline in the West Hall connector, and throughout the show attendees will see signs and be presented with historical photo ops.\nThe official founding anniversary date in mid-April falls during CTA\u2019s TechWeek, during which CTA will gather innovators and policymakers for several events including CTA\u2019s Digital Patriot\u2019s Dinner and CES on the Hill. CTA also is creating digital assets for its website and social media channels to highlight key moments in CTA\u2019s history.\nCES 1967 Registration: In 1967, what would become CTA was then the Consumer Products Division, just one sector within the sprawling Electronics Industries Association (EIA). With no industry-sponsored event, most CE vendors exhibited at a number of other, largely inappropriate, trade shows, primarily the Music Show sponsored by the National Association of Music Merchants (NAMM). In mid-1966, CPD staff VP Jack Wayman convinced the EIA board of the need for a specialty \u201cconsumer electronics show\u201d to shine a brighter light on the industry.\nSo how did the RMA evolve into CTA? The first consumer radios went on sale in late 1920 in time for a handful of early adopters to hear returns of the November presidential election in real time. Although radios cost more than $900 in 2023 dollars, by 1924 their annual factory dollar revenue reached nearly a $1 trillion in today\u2019s dollars. More than 175,000 people \u2013 including inaugural CTA Hall of Fame inductees Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla \u2013 attended the first Radio World\u2019s Fair in New York City in September 1924.\nThe first major technology shift came after WWII with the introduction of television. In 1947, only 250,000 TV sets were in use; the following year, TV set sales leaped more than 500%, following nearly the same hockey stick adoption course as radio had charted 25 years earlier and establishing a template for nearly every other disruptive tech device since.\nAdapting itself to the new reality, RMA re-named itself the Radio-Television Manufacturers Association (RTMA) in 1950, updated to the Radio-Electronics Television Manufacturers Association (RETMA) in 1953, just in time for TV sales to surpass those of radio. But the RETMA era didn\u2019t last long, either; in 1957, RETMA evolved into the more encompassing Electronic Industries Association (EIA).\nWith the rise of other commercial, industrial, and military/government electronics, the consumer electronics industry morphed into a division within EIA. In 1967, the Consumer Electronics Group (CEG) of EIA founded CES in two New York City hotels.\nAt its 50th anniversary in 1974, EIA tracked sales of just four major consumer technology product categories: TV, radio, phonograph players, and audio tape devices. The next 20 years, however, would see perhaps the greatest burst of consumer technology innovation in history, including the compact audio cassette, LCD, telephone answering machines, the cellphone, the VCR, the camcorder, the personal audio player, the microprocessor, the handheld calculator, the personal computer, the video game, the compact disc, GPS, satellite TV, fax machines, digital cameras, solid-state storage, HDTV, and the internet.\nCEG broke off from EIA in 1995 to become the Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), which was redubbed the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA) in 1999, and, finally, the Consumer Technology Association \u2013 CTA \u2013 in November 2015.\nAt CES, attendees will get a lot more granularity of not only the last century of the consumer technology business but hints of CTA\u2019s next century as well.\nSee also: CTA Joins, Adds Tech Pillar To UN\u2019s \u2018Human Security For All\u2019 Campaign\nStewart Wolpin\nFor more stories like this, and to keep up to date with all our market leading news, features and analysis, sign up to our newsletter here.\nTags \u22c5 CEG \u22c5 CES \u22c5 CES 2024 \u22c5 CTA \u22c5 CTA Centennial \u22c5 EIA \u22c5 History \u22c5 RETMA \u22c5 RMA \u22c5 RTMA \u22c5 Stewart Wolpin\nFeatured\nVIDEO: The New Age Electronics Outlook\u2014Part 3\u2014with Steve Koenig\nSupply Shortages And Port Delays Driving Holiday Shoppers To Start Early This Season\nBack-to-School Season Means Gearing Up for More e-Learning and Working From Home\n3 New Nationwide Vendor Partners Available To Boost Home Entertainment Experience\nRelated Articles\nCall For Editorial Coverage In The Official 2024 CES Daily\nCES 2024: TCL Raises The Bar For 2024\nCoway Receives CES 2024 Innovation Award For BEREX Reclining Massage Bed\nInfiRay Car Night Vision System To Make U.S. Debut At CES 2024\nHisense To Showcase \u2018Future Of Display Technology\u2019 at CES 2024\nCTA Announces Nasdaq\u2019s Adena Friedman To Keynote AT CES 2024\nCTA Announces HD Hyundai To Keynote CES 2024\nITRI To Exhibit Innovations Across Industries At CES 2024\nCyrusher Set to Unveil Cutting-Edge Electric Bicycle Innovations at CES 2024\nElevance Health\u2019s Gail Boudreaux To Keynote At CES 2024\n\u00a9 2024 TWICE is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher."
