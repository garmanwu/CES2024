More than 20 cutting-edge solutions will be on display, helping to bring connectivity, sensor integration and passenger comfort to the next level in the mobility revolution.\nAGC, in operation for over a century, is re-envisioning the future of vehicle glass enabling glass transition from being a simple barrier around the vehicle in the past, to becoming a multi-functional interface for the future. As the market focuses on ensuring safety for drivers in the race towards autonomy and self-driving, the industry's interest grows in mounting sensors, enhanced connectivity performances, disruptive car design and driving comfort. Aligned with market trends, our booth will showcase unique on-glass integrated solutions for mobility at booth 6667 in 3 major areas.\nThe connectivity area:\nAn innovative automotive antenna product, seamlessly merging aesthetics with top-tier connectivity and energy efficiency, will make its debut at CES 2024. Its design emphasizes easy integration and optimal performance, catering to the modern demands of vehicle connectivity. This advancement is expected to redefine standards in vehicle design and functionality, marking a significant milestone in the automotive industry.\nIn addition, AGC and Halo.Car, an innovative Las Vegas-based EV driverless car service, will demonstrate a new solution incorporating AGC\u2019s 5G glass antennas expertise. Compatible with all frequencies of 5G, this elegant solution allows points of connectivity all around the vehicle, improving V2V and V2X communications while minimizing communication drops.\nThe detecting area:\nWhile the market is looking to integrate high-position sensors on the vehicle mainly in roof or windshield, Wideye is delighted to unveil two integrations:\nThe first is a fully new concept of integrating a LiDAR into the roof, in the form of a unique shaped glass. The result is visually innovative as the integration is seamless, preserving the vehicle's sleek lines. The concept will give OEM design teams a new perception, paving the way to improve lidar roof integration and solve its numerous challenges.\nThe second is an in-cabin sensor integration, featuring a high Field of View Lidar co-integrated with multiple cameras behind the windshield. The latter, foreseen as the future of LiDAR integration, is an appealing design, coping with latest integration requirements in terms of form factor, performance, and reliability.\nThe comfort area:\nGlass is the perfect match when it comes to blending aesthetics and functional elements for interiors and cockpits revamping. This year, our cover glass for displays, which is a staple in the Mobility sector, is getting a major enhancement to reach a breakthrough for upcoming developments. AGC is at the forefront of new and disruptive HMI technologies of display integration within cockpits: windscreen and blade display showcased by FeelInGlass\u00ae and P-Displays.\nIn addition, for CES 2024, AGC is debuting large, curved displays with Anti-reflective and fingerprint-resistant coatings. All along the event, our Reeflect\u00ae Prototyping experts will be there to discuss your market projects, from a single sample to a small series, challenging the latest innovations & technologies of Automotive glazing.\n\u201cAt AGC, we firmly believe that glass and performance chemicals permeate \u00a0every aspect of your living environment, enabling us to drive innovation across all domains with our cutting-edge technology,\u201d said Hideyuki Kurata, CTO. \u201cWe have been refining core technologies such as material technology, functional design, and production technology since its foundation.

It is specially crafted for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving and can be mounted on multiple vehicle parts to ensure optimal protection while maintaining a sleek design.\nConnection: 5G-compatible Glass Antenna\nElegantly designed, these glass antennas are compatible with all frequencies of 5G. They can be installed from the interior side of existing window glass, thereby converting the windows into antennas. Halo.Car, an innovative Las Vegas-based EV driverless car service that uses 5G, has incorporated AGC's glass antennas, which have been used strategically to minimize communication drops.\nComfortability: Automotive Display Cover Glass\nWe were the first in the world to introduce automotive display cover glass. Leveraging advanced processing technology, quality, and strength, as well as the advantages of film deposition technologies such as anti-reflective and fingerprint-resistant coatings, we have achieved \"safety,\" \"high visibility,\" and \"superior aesthetics.\" This time, we are planning to showcase large, curved displays.\nCES attendees and automotive enthusiasts can visit the AGC exhibition to learn more about these innovations at Booth 6667 in LVCC West Hall Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility. AGC representatives and executives will be at the booth to demonstrate the technologies and answer any questions.\nAbout AGC\nAGC Inc.
