Ultrathin, lightweight, robust and economical to manufacture: these key features distinguish flexible, organic and printed electronics from traditional semiconductor technologies.\nAt a glance\nFlexible, organic and printed electronics stands for a revolutionary new type of electronics \u2013 also called \u201cemerging electronics\u201d \u2013 which is thin, lightweight, flexible, robust, and produced at low cost. \u201cEmerging electronics\u201d means electronics beyond the classic silicon approach, including flexible, printed electronics from organic, polymeric or inorganic materials. The organic and printed electronics technology also enables a wide range of electrical components to be produced and can be directly integrated into low cost reel-to-reel processes. This enables single-use, ubiquitous electronic devices and new applications. Closely related terms to printed electronics are e.g. organic, inorganic, plastic, polymer, flexible, thin-film, or large-area electronics. The majority of these technology areas is covered by OE-A and its members.\nVariety of printing processes\nThe key elements of printed electronics are conductive, semi-conductive or dielectric inks and pastes. These can be economically printed on large area foils, such as polyester or other plastics, as well as on paper, glass or textiles. It is thereby crucial, that these materials can be processed using printing- and coating techniques.There is no standard technique for producing printed electronics. Exactly which method is being used depends on the particular application, ink and substrate. The producer needs to consider whether a high resolution, throughput or homogeneity is required. Nearly all types of industrial printing processes are being used, ranging from gravure and flexographic printing, to screen and inkjet printing. However, these techniques need to be modified to allow the printing of electronics. It is furthermore possible to apply known processes from the classical semiconductor manufacturing, such as vapor deposition. The combination of all these types of process technologies with the knowledge from other industry sectors, such as material development and electrical engineering, has enabled the mass production of printed electronics.\nEnabling new possibilities\nPrinted electronics is the key to the manufacturing of a multitude of electronic components. Varying from transistors, circuits and sensors to displays, light sources, solar cells and touch surfaces. This technology opens up new areas of application using a novel approach to manufacturing electronics. Due to its technical and design freedom, printed electronics complements classical electronics. New markets and innovative products are being created, that were first unthinkable.\n\u00a9 OE-A\n2021"

        "raw_content": "New OE-A roadmap unveils printed electronics industry prospects\n\"In the last couple of years we have seen the accelerating adoption of printed, flexible, and hybrid electronics in a wide range of products and markets,\" states Dr. Klaus Hecker, Managing Director of OE-A.\nThis proves the latest Roadmap Whitepaper published by OE-A (Organic and Printed Electronics Association), a working group within VDMA.\nThe new edition of the \"OE-A Roadmap for Flexible, Organic and Printed Electronics\" offers an in-depth exploration of the industry's advancing maturity. In addition to updates on key technologies and capabilities, the roadmap incorporates the insights of over 100 industry experts, who provide detailed short, medium, and long-term forecasts for various markets. \"These are exciting times for our industry. We will see more flexible and even stretchable displays, building facades that harvest energy with transparent OPVs. Car interiors will change completely with the widespread integration of sensors, light sources and heating in the interior trim. Printed electronics will also play a major role in improving healthcare, for example with sensors that make it easier to monitor vital signs. And these are just a few examples for what is afoot.\" adds Klaus Hecker.\nMarket trend sustainability\nThe market for flexible and printed electronics continues to show strong growth. New technological approaches in both production and products are the basis for significantly increasing energy and resource efficiency along the value chain. It is clear that the technology is opening up new possibilities when it comes to sustainable production processes and sustainable materials. Printing, as an additive process, consumes less material and energy, and reduces the amount of waste. Printing plus related advanced processing enables broader use of recycled or eco-friendly materials to support product lifecycle circularity.\nPanasonic PhotoMOS\u00ae Photovoltaic MOSFET High-Power Drivers\nAdam-Tech Wire-to-Board Solutions\nFurther reading\nA selection of News & Analysis articles for further reading"
