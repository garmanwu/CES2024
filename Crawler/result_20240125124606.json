The investment will see Daiya lead the marketplace with a traditional fermented plant-based cheese across its portfolio, revolutionizing consumers' perception and experience of the category.\nBy combining traditional cheesemaking methods with modern technology, Daiya is making a plant-based cheese with similar characteristics to dairy-based products. While many brands in the category are exploring the incorporation of GMO techniques, such as precision fermentation, Daiya is perfecting the art of plant-based cheese making with an investment in natural fermentation. The fermentation site will sit in the company's state-of-the-art production facility in Burnaby, British Columbia \u2013 the largest stand-alone plant-based facility of its kind in North America.\n\"This is one of the largest investments in next generation plant-based cheese since we started the company 15 years ago, and with it Daiya is raising the bar for what consumers can expect from the category. We believe that the future of plant-based cheese achieving parity to dairy lies in traditional fermentation techniques. I don't believe any brand has fully cracked the code on a formula that cheese lovers feel entirely confident in \u2013 Daiya is going to change that!\" said Michael Watt, CEO of Daiya.\nThe plant-based food industry has grown steadily over the past five years and is projected to reach a market value of US$95.52 billion by 2029*. This growing trend has consumers shifting towards a plant-based diet, creating an opportunity for brands to provide a portfolio of quality and flavorful plant-based products that deliver an exceptional consumer experience. While the alternative milk and meat categories have been key players to date, there is now an opportunity for plant-based cheese to make its mark.\nJamie Siu, R&D Director, Advanced Research and Technology at Daiya said: \"We've worked with experts to develop a facility and formulation that is world-class. For our team to be able to deliver this fermented product has been no small task. It has involved extensive research and development in the traditional art of cheesemaking, applied in a plant-based setting.\"\nThe company expects to see this innovation reach the marketplace by the end of the year.

In addition, they are non-GMO project verified and feature glyphosate-free and certified gluten-free oats.\nAlong with an improved taste and texture, the new product launches feature a change in branding by Daiya, including a logo revamp, a new tagline and a packaging overhaul.

        "raw_content": "Biggest Trends of CES 2024: AI, Transparent Screens and Off-Grid Tech to Power Your Home\nThe trends emerging from the Las Vegas tech show are setting the tone for the year to come.\nAI is one of the most persistent themes at CES 2024.\nThere's an element of predictability when it comes to what we'll see every year at the Las Vegas tech bonanza CES. Big TVs? Tick. Home robots that never go on sale? Tick. An unnecessarily overdesigned toothbrush? Tick.\nEvery CES also brings its standout trends that dominate the big, flashy press conferences, the show floor and the late-night chatter at casino bars. Some of the biggest trends at this week's CES 2024 were easy to foresee; a massive emphasis on AI, for example. Others, such as transparent screens and new solutions to take your house off the grid, were only discernible once we'd scoured the show floors of the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nHere are our key takeaways, distilled for you based on everything CNET's editors have seen, tested and played with.\nAI in everything\nYou have about as much chance of winning at the slot machines as finding a company that doesn't boast of its AI prowess at CES 2024. This is far from the first time AI-powered products could be found amid the booths, but this is truly the year that AI is dominating the show.\nRead more: The Most Captivating Tech at CES 2024\nThe way it's showing up, says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee, is \"a layer of intelligence that sits atop a traditional product or service to enhance the customer experience.\" He points to products such as bird feeders to identify birds and pillows that adjust to reduce snoring as key examples.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nWhat we're witnessing right now is the integration of major breakthroughs in AI that have occurred in the past year or so -- such as OpenAI's ChatGPT -- into devices. \"There's no question that AI -- specifically generative AI -- is going to be a big driver of new products and services,\" says CNET's AI guru Connie Guglielmo.\nGuglielmo highlights Microsoft's decision to change up the Windows keyboard for the first time in nearly 30 years, adding a button that provides a direct link to launch its AI Copilot, as a key example. Another is\u00a0Volkswagen adding ChatGPT as a standard feature in its vehicles later this year. \"You can literally talk your car in a Knight Rider kind of way,\" she says.\nAlong with the AI products we've experienced firsthand, companies are dropping hints left, right and center at CES about what we can expect to see from them in the year ahead. In an\u00a0interview with CNET Senior Editor Lisa Eadicicco, Google's Sameer Samat, general manager and vice president of Android, Google Play and Wear OS, said that AI will play a key role in the evolution of how we interact with our phones.\nThat supports Guglielmo's take that \"we're just starting to see how this foundational tech is going to change the way we work, live and engage with the world.\"\nWe're already curious to see how this rapidly evolving technology will have changed the game again by the time CES 2025 rolls around.\nThe VW Golf will get chatbot technology from Cerence and OpenAI.\nThe screen, reinvented\nScreen technology is always a big deal at CES and this year is no exception, with exciting display advancements seen in everything from massive TVs to concept bendable phones. As CNET's TV expert David Katzmaier puts it, \"TVs are even bigger and brighter this year. Hisense and TCL, both made their mini-LED lineups twice as bright for the same money as last year, and both introduced huge, expensive models with eye-watering specifications at 110 and 115 inches.\"\nNeither model has been priced yet, but they're expected to cost many thousands of dollars. New screen tech never comes cheap, and nowhere is that more obvious than in C Seed's wild, folding N1, which splits its 137-inch display into five sections to neatly fold away -- and which comes with an astonishing $200,000 price tag. What cost-of-living crisis?\nCrazy displays for days.\n\"A new trend this year is transparent displays\" Katzmaier says. \"LG has made transparent OLED screens for the last few years for businesses, but its newest model will go on sale later this year for consumers.\"\nThe idea behind that new model, the OLED T, is to allow a screen to blend more seamlessly into the surrounding room when it's not in use, rather than simply being a gigantic black rectangle. When not in use, the display looks more like a window, with fish, stars or other objects dancing across the glass and a black film rising to cover the rear when you want it to function as a regular TV. As Katzmaier puts it: \"It's one of the coolest TVs I've ever seen.\"\nNot one to let LG have all the fun, Samsung showed off its own transparent display technology using micro-LEDs which look brighter and more colorful than OLED screens. While the demo was cool, it's more likely we'll see Samsung's see-through screen in commercial applications in the near future, rather than for your next TV.\nSamsung showed off new screen tech for its phones, too. Its Flex In & Out Flip concept caught Eadicicco's eye. \"The concept is a Z Flip-style phone that can bend both ways,\" she says. \"With a device like this, you'd be able to use the screen whether the device is opened or closed, potentially making your phone much easier to use in one hand.\"\nTerrible product name aside, the Flex In & Out Flip shows that companies like Samsung --\nalong with Motorola and its awesome rollable phone concept shown last year -- aren't ready to settle on one folding phone design just yet.\nNext-gen gaming technology\nGaming tech remains a staple of the show floor at this year's CES. New Intel 14th-gen mobile chips were found inside new laptops from Alienware, Lenovo, Asus, Razer and others along with expected updates across the board for higher performance. Many products, including HP's new Omen, are eschewing the typical \"battlestar\" aesthetic of many legacy gaming machines, instead giving options for those of us wanting a \"one size fits all\" machine for working during the day and fragging noobs at night.\nWe've also seen new graphics cards from Nvidia, vibrating gaming seats from Razer and refreshed gaming-focused phones from Asus.\nMSI's The Claw is one of the most powerful handheld game consoles yet.\nBut we've also been treated to the first handheld PC gaming console using Intel chips. Valve's SteamDeck gave us our first experience of playing PC games in a hand-held format when it launched back in 2022, and both Asus and Lenovo were quick to bring out their own versions. But while the models from Valve, Asus and Lenovo all use AMD processors, MSI's new Claw handheld packs Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 processors, which CNET Principal Writer Scott Stein reckons could make it the most powerful PC handheld around.\nWindows-based PC handhelds have been generally well received, allowing keen gamers to enjoy their polygon punching from the comfort of their couches without having to always fire up a gigantic, LED-strewn gaming rig. MSI's Intel-based model will bring a fresh injection of competition to the burgeoning category.\n\"What the Claw symbolizes may be even more important than what it does,\" Stein says. \"Intel is joining the party on new handheld-ready gaming chips, which suggests that hardware manufacturers should be even more able to create Steam Deck-like handhelds running Windows.\"\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nEnergy tech evolution\nAt previous editions of CES, the lack of home energy tech and serious solutions to help us tackle the environmental crisis has left us a little puzzled. There's no time like the present to right those wrongs and declare green technology a major trend of the show this year.\nOver the past few years, we've been buffeted by cost-of-living and environmental crises, amid skyrocketing energy prices, a greater need for more sophisticated heating and cooling tech, pressure on the electrical grid and waves of power outages. Smart homeowners everywhere are more aware that they need to take their energy management into their own hands, and CES 2024 has shown us how tech companies are responding.\nProducts such as a portable, whole-home backup battery from EcoFlow and new solar technology in the form of electricity-generating stained glass are just some of the innovations in energy technology. Meanwhile, our road to increasing self-reliance is being paved with things like\u00a0moisture-farming tech that can generate water from thin air and smart energy services that let you switch between on-grid and off-grid energy sources with a single button.\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nAre the products at CES 2024 enough to make a serious statement about the tech industry's commitment to sustainability? No. But as Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson said ahead of the show, it's \"a small step in the right direction.\"\n\"The next stage would be to embed sustainability and circular economy principles into the very design of new technology and product offerings,\" he added.\nIn the meantime, the new technologies we've seen this year can help us imagine what a livable future looks like as the realities of climate change, particularly extreme weather, continue to set in.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 preview: What to expect at tech\u2019s biggest show | The DeanBeat\nDo you want to get the latest gaming industry news straight to your inbox? Sign up for our daily and weekly newsletters here.\nNext week at the CES 2023 trade show in Las Vegas, we\u2019ll once again be able to see and hear about the latest tech trends in person.\nThis year, the organizers of\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0expect more than 130,000 attendees through January 12, with hundreds of speakers, 3,500-plus exhibitors and 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space, according to Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, the trade group that stages the event.\nThat\u2019s a reasonable step up from last year\u2019s event with 118,000 people, 3,200 exhibitors and 2.1 million square feet. And it means showgoers will have to pay attention to how to avoid crowds in Las Vegas. If you\u2019re a veteran of the show, make sure you don\u2019t go to the South Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) because it\u2019s closed this year. I\u2019ve done my tips and tricks for attending CES 2024 already and this story is about what to expect beyond the bigger crowds.\nLast year, there were 4,800\u00a0media at the event. Like me, they will start showing up at the event on Sunday for a tech trends talk at 4 p.m. and the CES Unveiled press event at 5 p.m. Sunday. That\u2019s always a good place for me to spot some trends among the award winners displaying at the event.\nOn Monday, the press conferences will start at 8 a.m. with LG and finished up at 5 p.m. with Sony, with others like Bosch, Panasonic, Samsung, TCL and others vying for the press attention during the day. Most of these affairs will likely be livestreamed in case you can\u2019t be one of the lucky press jammed into a room elbow to elbow with other press. I\u2019m quite fearful I\u2019m going to run out of battery power on this day.\nBy Tuesday, the main show floors will open with nearly 3,500 exhibitors across more than 2.1 million square feet of space, Shapiro said. That\u2019s down from 4,500 exhibitors and 2.9 million square feet in January 2020. But it\u2019s still a sizable show and it runs through Friday.\nAnd while CES is still a place for the giants Samsung in the Las Vegas Convention Center, the show will have tons of small exhibitors, with about 1,100 of them \u2014 many organized by region such as France or the Netherlands \u2014 in the traditional Eureka Park startup space in the Venetian.\nThe big trends\nI like to reminisce about old trends as I think about new ones. Back in 2010, I remember that 3D glasses were the big deal at the show. In 2008, Steve Ballmer touted Microsoft\u2019s Zune player that was going to bring death to the iPod, and digital TV was still an exciting development.\nThis week, PR Newswire announced it has studied its 8,600 press releases issued in November and December 2023. The company said there were 800 press releases that mentioned generative AI in those months, or nearly 10% of the total. It noted there were 1,100 press releases during the past two months that mentioned \u201ccybersecurity.\u201d A year ago, words such as metaverse, NFTs, sustainability and robots were hot topics. Sadly, we didn\u2019t get much more detail out of PR Newswire this year to give us more trends.\nThe U.S. consumer technology retail revenues will grow 2.8% in 2024 to $512 billion, according to the forecast from the Consumer Technology Association.\nThe revenues will be up $14 billion from 2023, and it signals an uptick in consumer spending on tech products and services, according to the CTA, the trade group which will put on the CES 2024 trade show in Las Vegas next week. In the previous two years, the numbers dropped from past years.\nGaming, AI, digital health, smart electric vehicles, sustainability and streaming services are among the categories expected to grow.\nI asked Tim Bajarin, analyst at Creative Strategies who has attended 49 CES shows over the years. He said AI will be the major trend, of course.\n\u201cJust about every keynote and most new products will have some sort of AI theme or connection. While VR and the Metaverse were big themes last year, AI takes center stage this year. however, I expect to see at least two new VR headsets and some innovative smart glasses introduced at the show,\u201d Bajarin said in an email to GamesBeat.\nHe added, \u201cCES also has themed areas for smart homes, health and fitness, and even food tech, these areas have become must-see sections to get a glimpse of how tech is becoming deeply integrated into all aspects of our lives. One other section is the new hall where the smart cars, boats and tractors are located. The auto industry has embraced CES, and it has become a showcase for showing off their tech-savvy vehicles.\u201d\nBajarin also believes smart glasses will introduce the idea of \u201cface computing.\u201d An example already in the market is Meta\u2019s Ray-Ban Meta sunglasses where you will be able to ask AI questions through the microphone in the connected sunglasses and get answers back from conversation AI.\nGenerative AI\nAI is still a kind of invisible product, but its presence will be visible everywhere at the show.\nGenerative AI is finding its way into the announcements of both startups and big companies. Microsoft said it will be adding a dedicated Copilot AI key to Windows PCs, making it the \u201cthe first significant change to the Windows PC keyboard in nearly three decades.\u201d\nThe CTA said over 230 million smartphones and PCs shipping to the U.S. this year will be able to tap the powers of generative AI through mobile apps, browsers and on-device software.\nAI is getting into everything, or at least marketing is catching on that it needs to get into everything. Seergrills\u2019\u00a0flagship product, Perfecta, is billed as the world\u2019s first AI-powered grill. It\u2019s debuting at the CES Unveiled on Monday. Perfecta uses proprietary NeuralFire technology to deliver chef level results at the touch of a button, in as little as 90 seconds.\nI\u2019m happy to be part of the generative AI and games trend. I\u2019ll be able to moderate a panel on AI and the Democratization of Games Design at 1 p.m. on January 10 at LVCC West Hall \u2014 W218. Our panelists include Jani Penttinen, CEO, of Bitmagic; Latoya Peterson, CXO at Glow Up Games; Jonathan Stringfield, Vice President, Global Business Research and Marketing, Activision Blizzard; and Ike Nnoli, Senior PMM, Graphics & Simulation at Nvidia.\neVTOLs on the rise, but not in the air yet\nOf course, we\u2019re going to see a lot of electric vehicles from the likes of Honda and John Deere and such. Sony and Honda are no doubt going to give us another revelation about their Afeela electric car coming in 2025.\nBut we\u2019re also going to see a fair amount of unusual EVs too. I\u2019m talking about the drive-and-fly electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft/car hybrids, which have been showing up for a few years.\nSupernal \u2013\u00a0Hyundai\u00a0Motor Group\u2019s Advanced Air Mobility company \u2013 is returning to the show to reveal its\u00a0eVTOL\u00a0product concept and much more. Supernal is building a \u201cvertiport\u201d exhibition in front of the West Hall entrance to the Las Vegas Convention Center so you can see it. Of course, it\u2019s kind of hard to demonstrate experimental aircraft in the city, so don\u2019t expect to get a free ride.\nHT Flying Car, an affiliate of XPeng, will have a booth in the West Hall of LVCC promoting its X2 eVTOL flying cars, which have received a flight permit in China. It\u2019s also showing off a two-seat X3 model.\nBrunswick will be back with modern designs for its boats. And by late 2024, you won\u2019t necessarily have to be a billionaire or an astronaut to see Earth from the stratosphere.\nYou could make a reservation on the Space Perspective vessel, a space balloon that transports a capsule to the heavens \u2013 safely, slowly, sustainably and in style. With financial backing from Base Ventures, Space Perspective wants to fly more of the general public to the stars.\nThe metaverse?\nWherever AI gets mentioned, the metaverse can\u2019t be far behind. And where the metaverse gets mentioned, Web3 will come up as well.\nWe saw this week that Ernest Cline, the author of Ready Player One, a bestselling book that was turned into a Steven Spielberg blockbuster movie, has created Readyverse Studios in partnership with Futureverse, a Web3 metaverse company that has raised a lot of money. Just like author Neal Stephenson, who coined the term \u201cmetaverse\u201d in his novel Snow Crash, Cline aims to create the products and infrastructure for the open metaverse.\nBlockchain has had a tough year and there has been backlash against the metaverse. I asked the CTA about whether this will affect the presence of these trends at the show.\nBrian Comiskey, CTA director of thematic programs (and one of the two CTA staff who will be presenting Tech Trends at the upcoming CES 2024) weighed in on the answer.\n\u201cA good way to think of tech advancement for later stage hype-cycle technologies like metaverse and blockchain is as a balancing act between consumers and enterprise. Those groups often have different sets of expectations around technology,\u201d Comiskey said in an email to GamesBeat. \u201cWhile metaverse and blockchain may have fallen out of news headlines after huge initial consumer hype, we\u2019re seeing innovation in both from enterprises, and you\u2019ll see those innovations driving a range of sectors forward at CES 2024.\u201d\nComiskey added, \u201cFor blockchain, great examples at CES 2024 include a secure voting system from Zkrypto, Lordystem\u2019s Trip. PASS mobile passport and tech from Galeon designed to help hospitals and caregivers securely share medical data. For metaverse, expect innovations like Dassault Systemes\u2019 Living Heart, which opens new doors to R&D focused on the human heart, innovations from Siemens my in the industrial metaverse and a range of auxiliary hardware designed to support a more immersive metaverse experience.\u201d\nAnd Husson at Forrester said, \u201cContrary to the metaverse hype where innovation is still happening behind the scenes in the industrial space, AI has indeed the power to reshape consumer experiences much faster and across many different verticals. This is one more reason for top consumer-facing brands like L\u2019Or\u00e9al or Walmart to keynote CES. The pervasiveness of technology in consumers\u2019 lives will increasingly force brands to innovate faster and to get a glimpse into the pulse of tomorrow\u2019s technology landscape.\u201d\nThe internet of things\nU-tec will be the latest to launch a smart home ecosystem at CES 2024. GE is debuting a smart in-home smoker for the kitchen with a lot of pre-set cooking features. Just about every major tech giant has its own ecosystem. We\u2019ll see how interoperable all of this stuff is going to be in the end. Samsung always has\nSmartThings announcements at the show, and LG has its own too.\nBut it\u2019s always fun to see the different twists these companies come up with to entertain consumers with the internet of things. There are plenty of smart home gadgets like smart pet doors or pet cameras.\nForrester analyst Thomas Husson observed that some things you don\u2019t see will be a big part of the technology at CES.\n\u201cCES will continue to be about eye-popping connected 8K or microLED bigger TV screens, next-gen gadgets, previews of smarter computers, and showcases of new EV prototype cars from Honda, Hyundai, and the likes. However, over the past few years, CES has been less and less about hardware and devices and more and more about AI, software, and new integrated experiences,\u201d Husson said.\nVR and gaming gear\nQualcomm and its partners will make some news at CES with a new generation of virtual reality and augmented reality chips. Those chips will arm device makers with the means to come up with the next generation of XR hardware.\nAt least five companies (Samsung, HTC Vive, Immersed, Play for Dream and one unnamed firm) will be at the show talking about their tech based on the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 platform, which has 2.5 times the GPU power and the ability to handle spatial computing with 4.3K resolution per eye at 90 frames per second. This is the kind of tech that the metaverse advocates will need to get rid of concerns about underwhelming VR experiences.\nXreal will be at the show to push the augmented reality glasses that it has been working on for years. Intel, AMD, Nvidia and Arm haven\u2019t spilled any beans yet, but you can bet they will be showing off cool stuff that gamers will get excited about.\nThere will also be a refresh of gaming gear such as gaming monitors. Samsung already revealed a trio of fast OLED screens that refresh screen images in a matter of milliseconds. Razer is taking some of those fast screens into its Razer Blade family of laptops. If you\u2019re looking for big screens, LG has a 97-inch OLED TV for you to gawk at during the show.\nWe just ended a pretty tough year in games marked by 11,000 layoffs, even with lots of high-quality games on the market. Consumers didn\u2019t spend as much as the game companies wanted, and so there was a mismatch in expectations.\nBut the CTA believes gaming will see a return to growth in 2024. Product refreshes in tablets, augmented and virtual reality headsets and gaming will boost gaming revenues in 2024. Gaming will also be amplified by a 12% growth in subscription services (growing to $3.5 billion in 2024). And AI is expected to improve the gaming experience while also helping developers bring games to market faster.\nOn the enterprise side, I believe we\u2019ll see a lot of talk about digital twins, which are virtual versions of real-life designs such as factories. Siemens\u2019 CEO is giving the opening keynote talk, and Siemens is one of the big believers in digital twins, which can simulate how a factory will work before a company spends all the money necessary to build it in the physical world.\nAnd, reinforcing that not everything is about games when it comes to VR, Ocutrx is showing a mixed reality headset aimed at restoring vision for patients with Advanced Macular Degeneration. The headset also has applications in manufacturing, surgery, enterprise tech and more.\nHealth tech\nHealth tech will be elevated to a new level as Gail Boudreaux, CEO of Elevance Health, will be the first from her industry to be able to give a major keynote talk.\nFor years, the Venetian expo has been the place where you could find could digital health products like smart blood pressure monitors, glucose monitors, connected toilets \u2014 and yes sexual wellness gadgets too.\nWithings, a pioneer of connected health that did the urine analysis lab in your toilet last year, will be back with more digital health gadgets, which are a category that consumers are embracing in the connected gadget realm, according to Capgemini.\nI\u2019ve been getting a number of product pitches that target elderly people and their caregivers, as tech has finally woken up to the demographic trend of the baby boomers get older. Some of these use radar systems to detect whether a senior has fallen in their home or not. Tech isn\u2019t going to be just for the young anymore.\nRetro trends\nIf you\u2019re not into all this new stuff, you can see old stuff too. RCA will be among the retro brands coming to the show, and it will show off home automation, e-bikes, scooters and retro-style electronics. For some of us, that brings back some memories.\nAs usual, I\u2019ve been pitched some oddball things that I didn\u2019t expect see. Clicks Technology has a product that is an homage to the Blackberry, as its Clicks case enables you to type on a physical keyboard on your iPhone. Shift Robotics has zany Moonwalkers X robotic shoes.\nMeanwhile, Osim is once again going to show off another generation of its uLove 3 Well-Being Chair, which uses AI to help give you massages. The chair is designed to measure, monitor, and manage stress while giving you a full-body massage.\nAfter picking up a video from your own library or by using a YouTube link, you can add scents on the timeline to set up the perfect smell, timing, and duration for a scent to go with your video.\nWhat\u2019s missing from CES\nSome common CES events won\u2019t happen. Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices don\u2019t have major formal events, but they will have a presence at the show. Apple doesn\u2019t exhibit at the show, as it always does its own events.\nI expect we won\u2019t see as many masks either. But I suggest everybody be extra safe with so many people concentrated in Vegas. There are still going to be 41,000 fewer people than there were at the peak show in January 2020. The CES is trying to make sure qualified people get into the show and we\u2019ll see how it looks overall.\nIf you\u2019re expecting COVID not to show up, I\u2019m guess that is going to be a bad guess. The CTA is not requiring masks or vaccination proof this year, though it recommends vaccination to everyone. I still wear a mask in crowds and I have seen COVID going around in my personal circles. I still managed to get a non-COVID illness during the holiday break and I will be doing fist bumps instead of shaking hands.\nIf you\u2019re really not into CES, you can check out Worst In Show, which is backed by Repair.org, PIRG, EFF, and iFixit. The Worst in Show highlights the least sustainable, least secure, least repairable, and overall just plain awful gadgets on the show floor. And if you want to learn about flops at CES throughout its history, check out the Gallery of Flops at LVCC North Hall Booth 9577.\nWorth going?\nLike many people, I feel CES is still a useful barometer to tell us what the year in tech (and sometimes games) will be like. And I still enjoy seeing people face-to-face, or mask-to-mask, at a trade show. Hopefully it will feel like we\u2019re all getting back to business.\nI\u2019m looking forward to seeing the Goodyear blimp at the show for the first time, and it will have news at the show. It\u2019s been talking for a while about Sightline, which is about tire intelligence.\nI\u2019m curious what\u2019s going to be showing up on the Sphere. Just kidding. Of course, for a nerd like me, CES is kind of like Disneyland for adults. I\u2019m sold at the start. But we should never underestimate the broad reach of tech and CES and its relevance to broader society.\nAs Chris Helsel, senior vice president of global operations and CTO at Goodyear, told me in an interview, \u201cTech is everywhere.\u201d\nTech for the rest of us\nI have some hope that there will be some interesting technologies from non-tech companies. It\u2019s interesting that one of the major opening keynotes will be Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L\u2019Or\u00e9al, a fashion company that is making its way into the digital realm. Another keynote will be Doug McMillon, CEO of Walmart. This is getting into the topic of tech for the rest of us, not just for nerds.\nMy favorite CES talk about tech from non-tech companies was a few years ago, when Arnold Donald \u2014 the CEO of the world\u2019s largest cruise company, Carnival Cruises \u2014 unveiled the Ocean Medallion wearable. That was interesting because it was an example of how technology was infiltrating a non-tech business, where the technology faded into the woodwork and the woodwork itself got smart. Carnival is now outfitting its 100-plus cruise ships with the technology.\nIn recent years, Procter & Gamble has also showed up with cool uses of tech in ordinary products, such as putting sensors and AI into products such as skin advisers, heated razors and more. It will be back this year with more products that promise the same kind of creativity as last year\u2019s products, which included a blemish remover that worked well on my face. After it launched, P&G pulled that one off the market.\nBut I could still use more of that, and I think we could all use tech that makes the current products that we use every day even better.\nGamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is \"where passion meets business.\" What does this mean?
