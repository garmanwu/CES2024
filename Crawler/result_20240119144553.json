        "raw_content": "Tech-fueled economic momentum delivers solid rebound\nChina Daily |\nUpdated: 2023-03-01 10:27\nTIANJIN \u2014 In a science and technology park in North China's Tianjin municipality, dozens of mechanical arms move along a production line while busy robots carrying components weave about.\nEach day more than 2,000 sets of power batteries are churned out, which are used for nearly 200 electric vehicles.\nThe scene is a sharp contrast to three years ago when production of the line was intermittently suspended in the Tianjin Lishen Battery Joint-Stock Co Ltd factory due to order shortages.\nLishen started providing power batteries for the Dongfeng Motor Corp four years ago, delivering about 53,000 sets by the end of last year. In 2023, however, it is estimated that 45,000 sets will be supplied.\n\"We didn't stop working even during the Spring Festival holiday,\" said Zhao Xiaojun, deputy head of Lishen's power battery manufacturing department.\n\"Now that we are no longer worried about order shortages, we fear that we can't complete the orders on time.\"\nLishen is just one of the examples that show the resilience of the Chinese economy after the country relaxed its COVID-19 restrictions late last year.\nAccording to statistics by the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, in 2022, output and sales of new energy vehicles in China were 7.06 million and 6.89 million units, up 96.9 percent and 93.4 percent, respectively.\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has lifted its forecast for China's economic growth this year to 5.2 percent from a previous prediction of 4.4 percent.\nSuppliers for Lishen are mostly domestic companies. Last May, when consignments were hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic, local authorities in Tianjin helped to arrange for closed-loop delivery to ensure production in Lishen.\n\"If we stop our production, the loss per day would be as much as 30 million yuan ($4.32 million),\" said Zhao.\nIn 2022, despite the pandemic, the revenue of power batteries in Lishen soared by 76 percent.\nAccording to China's State Council Information Office, last year's investment in high-tech industries witnessed rapid growth, up 18.9 percent from the previous year. The growth rate for high-tech manufacturing was 22.2 percent and the rate for high-tech services was 12.1 percent.\nAnother Tianjin-based company, TCL Zhonghuan Semiconductor Co Ltd, is working on its new project, producing a solar ultra-thin single wafer of 25 GW used for the transformation of light into electricity. Zhang Xuenan, deputy chief engineer of the company, told Xinhua that once in full operation, the project could generate a revenue of billions of yuan and create thousands of jobs.\n\"This project is another example of China's economic growth potential,\" said Bo Wenguang, vice-president of the Binhai Development Research Institute of Nankai University. \"The potential is gradually expanded and unleashed.\"\nTwo new projects are under construction in Lishen with investment for each topping 10 billion yuan. A third is being discussed. Once in operation, their combined production capacity could be at least 10 times the company's current capacity.\n\"I'm sure that constant innovation, research and development will keep injecting impetus into our company,\" said Lishen's general manager, Zhang Qiang.\nXinhua"

Almost 10 years later, the Chinese state-owned manufacturer will again seek a listing, this time to raise funds to produce more electric-vehicle batteries.\nTianjin Lishen Battery Joint-Stock Co., as the company is known in full, is considering a listing in Shanghai or Shenzhen to expand its annual capacity to 20 gigawatt hours -- about 18 percent more than the estimated total battery consumption last year in China -- by 2020, according to President Qin Xingcai. As a publicly traded company, Lishen will also be better placed to attract and retain talent to compete globally with the likes of Samsung SDI Co. and Panasonic Corp., he said.\n\u201cWith our vehicle battery business picking up, we are much more mature now and the risks are lower,\u201d Qin said in an interview this month at his office in Tianjin, referring to the company\u2019s struggles to survive a decade back. Demand will continue to be supported by a \u201ccomplete local supply chain, an enormous EV market and favorable government policies,\u201d he said.\nEV manufacturers and battery suppliers are raising funds to tap on a projected fivefold surge in global demand for vehicle batteries by 2020, with China probably accounting for more than half of global capacity by then, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch estimates. Lishen Battery\u2019s close competitor, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., is seeking to list on the over-the-counter stock market, while Warren Buffett-backed BYD Co. trades on the Shenzhen stock exchange.\nFunding Expansion\n\u201cChinese vehicle battery makers will definitely play a significant role in global competition,\u201d said Gao Xiaobing, a Shenzhen-based analyst at Gaogong Industry Research Institute. \u201cThe industry is still in the early stage and needs to burn a lot of money. Companies are thirsting for financing to expand.\u201d\nUnderpinning the projected surge in demand is China\u2019s commitment to boost yearly sales of new-energy vehicles by a factor of 10 in the next decade, which has helped attract a raft of startups to develop new-energy vehicles. That in turn will spur consumption of vehicle batteries, which is estimated to surge to 142 gigawatt hours by 2020 from 16.9 gigawatt hours last year, according to Gaogong Industry Research.\nLishen Battery, based in Tianjin, estimates revenue will increase 55 percent to 6.5 billion yuan ($974 million) this year. Sales of EV batteries will probably double to 4 billion yuan, according to Qin.\nThe company has poured 5.2 billion yuan this year to build three new EV battery plants in Tianjin, Suzhou and Qingdao to more than triple its output to 10 gigawatts by the end of next year. Its local customers include FAW Car Co., Guangzhou Automobile Group Co., and Brilliance China Automotive Holdings. The company said it\u2019s also teaming up with foreign car companies such as Daimler AG\u2019s Mercedes-Benz to develop batteries.\nLishen Battery started out making batteries for mobile phones and watches in 1997 and supplied multinational companies including Motorola and Apple Inc. The company is controlled by state-owned China Electronics Technology Group, whose businesses include developing software to identify potential terrorists.\nSecond Attempt\nBack in 2007, Qin said the company had to withdraw its IPO in Hong Kong after racking up losses due to canceled orders from Motorola, which itself was on a downward spiral that led to its eventual breakup into two companies in 2011. A directive at that time by the central government to state-owned companies to prioritize domestic stock-market listings also hindered its overseas IPO plans.\n\u201cIt is still a good timing for those battery makers to take advantage of investor enthusiasm for this industry,\u201d said Neil Wang, Greater China president at consultancy Frost & Sullivan. \u201cNow is a critical time for battery manufacturers to expand production and secure their relationship with downstream original equipment manufacturers.\u201d\nTo contact Bloomberg News staff for this story: Yan Zhang in Beijing at yzhang1044@bloomberg.net.
