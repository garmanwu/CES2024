And they're essential to every electronic device that we currently use, from computers, to televisions, to air conditioners and washing machines.\"\nBut chip shortages have been a critical issue around the globe in recent years, all while demand grew.\nWith not enough chips to produce key components in products like cars, the vehicles became more expensive and the jobs of those who produce them were drastically cut.\n\"It was a lesson,\" Banafa said. \"It was a big lesson, not only for the United States, (but) for all the countries to understand.\"\nIn August of 2022, Congress passed the CHIPS and Science Act, setting aside billions for semiconductor chips production and more.\nMORE: Chip shortage: Road to recovery will take years and require 400K more stem workers, new factories\n\"What our administration has been able to do is invest $53 billion in semiconductor (research and development) and manufacturing,\" Harris said. \"All, again, with the intention of spurring the innovation and the creativity.\"\nThe goal is to encourage more production of semiconductor chips here in the U.S.\nHarris says the investments have led to Sunnyvale's Applied Materials' announcement made overnight, that a new semiconductor research and development facility is set to be built by early 2026\n\"When completed, it will be the largest such facility in the world,\" Harris said, \"Of course, it will contain some of the most cutting edge technology, including machines that can build semiconductor components as thin as a single atom.\"\nResearch and development experts say will be critical to Silicon Valley maintaining its place as the hub of ever evolving technology.\n\"If we want to be a leader in the AI, even a leader of the technology, we have to have the hardware that's going to run all these technologies,\" Banafa said, \"All of them built on chips and chips to build semiconductors and we are in Silicon Valley and silicon is the material used in semiconductors. This is why they call it Silicon Valley.\"\nIf you're on the ABC7 News app, click here to watch live\nRelated Topics\nTop Stories\nTIMELINE: 'Parade of storms' begins Friday in Bay Area\n49ers faithful fans rally on eve of playoff game against Packers\nMan charged with murdering wife at Santa Clara home: authorities\nBay Area prepares for heavy rain and potential flooding\n2 shot at Pittsburg BART station, transit agency says\nTeamsters call off strike after reaching agreement with CSU\nSalinas campus helps teens facing incarceration pave new paths\nInnocence Project working to clear convicted killer Scott Peterson"

Harris did not specify what incentives might be headed to the Santa Clara-based company, which makes chip-manufacturing equipment.\n\u201cAs indispensable as semiconductors are today, they will become even more important in the future,\u201d said Harris, citing the technology\u2019s role in solar- and wind-power technology, satellite networks for high-speed internet, and artificial intelligence applications in medicine and agriculture.\nThe White House has frequently tapped the East Bay native to tout technology-related developments.\u00a0She met earlier this month with industry CEOs and has warned of risks from generative AI. In August, she visited the Chabot Space and Science Center in Oakland to promote the U.S. space industry and in December convened the Biden administration\u2019s first National Space Council meeting.\nThe CHIPS and Science Act directs $280 billion in spending over the next decade, including $200 billion for commercialization and research and development, and $53 billion for semiconductor manufacturing, R&D and workforce development, plus $24 billion in tax credits for chip making.\nThe silicon chip, the technology that gave this region its name, is today made mostly overseas. Harris\u2019 visit reflects the White House\u2019s push to reverse the decline in U.S. chip making, to support national security, the economy and the nation\u2019s tech industries.\nThe U.S., once a major player in chip making with 37% of the world\u2019s production in the \u201990s, now makes 12%, according to an October report from consultancy giant McKinsey & Company, which has projected the size of the semiconductor market at $1 trillion by 2030. Pandemic-related supply chain snafus, particularly of the chips used in cars, highlighted the perils for the U.S. of heavy reliance on overseas-made semiconductors.\nApplied Materials, along with Lam Research in Fremont and KLA Corporation in Milpitas, is among the world\u2019s top chip-making equipment manufacturers, and chip-design titans Nvidia, Apple and Google keep Silicon Valley at the forefront of chip development, even as the manufacturing has largely moved overseas.\nSilicon Valley companies are \u201cthe global leaders in semiconductor design,\u201d said Sean Randolph, senior director of the Bay Area Council Economic Institute.\nApplied Materials\u2019 project, though not making semiconductors, will help build domestic chip making by \u201cleveraging the expertise here in the Bay Area to accelerate the manufacturing process in the U.S. and globally with our partners,\u201d Randolph said.\nHarris\u2019 visit comes a day after China banned chips from Idaho-based manufacturer Micron and as U.S. tech and political leaders fret that China\u2019s threatening behavior toward Taiwan could lead to disruption of chip flow from Taiwan, which makes most of the world\u2019s chips and nearly all the most sophisticated ones.\nThe new Applied Materials \u201cEPIC\u201d facility, slated for completion in early 2026, with the $4 billion spent over seven years, is to include a sterile room bigger than three football fields where chipmakers can have a dedicated space to work with \u201cnext-generation technologies and tools,\u201d and university researchers can collaborate with chip-industry professionals, Applied Materials said.\n\u201cBy investing in manufacturing capacity we will create a more resilient supply chain,\u201d CEO Gary Dickerson told the crowd assembled under and around a large tent, where EPIC is to be located, next to the firm\u2019s Maydan Technology Center.\nApplied Materials said it expected facility construction to employ up to 1,500 construction workers, and that EPIC would create up to 2,000 new engineering jobs and potentially thousands more in related industries.\nThe amount the company intends to spend will depend on the level of federal support it receives via the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, it said. Applied Materials last year received a $30 million grant from California intended to help the firm obtain CHIPS Act funding.\nQuickly advancing artificial intelligence and the transition to cleaner energy are among tech industry trends that will accelerate chip demand in coming years, said Prabu Raja, president of Applied Materials\u2019 semiconductor products group.\nRelated Articles\nIconic Santa Clara chip maker Intel is working to complete a deal announced last year to buy Israeli semiconductor maker Tower Semiconductor, which owns factories in Newport Beach and San Antonio, Texas, as well as in Japan and Israel.\n\u201cThe spirit of innovation, dare I say, is central to who we are,\u201d Harris told the crowd gathered Monday. \u201cAs a proud daughter of California, I believe there are few places where that spirit burns brighter than right here in Silicon Valley.\u201d\nShare this:\nMost Popular\nAsk Amy: My grandmother guessed my secret, and I\u2019m afraid she\u2019ll tell my parents\nHarriette Cole: My family opposes this unconventional living situation\nHarriette Cole: I lost my cool and sent a text she said was inappropriate\nDear Abby: My ex-friend isn\u2019t happy about it, but her husband was mine first\nDear Abby: I know he stole my jewelry, and I\u2019m so disgusted I can\u2019t even speak to him\nVote now: Bay Area News Group girls athlete of the week\nTrader Joe\u2019s 2024 winners: Customers\u2019 9 favorite products\nBig San Jose regional mall is bought by real estate group from Texas and NYC\nHarriette Cole: I don\u2019t deserve to be her maid of honor?
