        "raw_content": "Skyted Unveils \u201cMobility Privacy Mask\u201d And \u201cHybrid Silent Mask\u201d At CES 2024\nCES 2024 is set to feature an intriguing debut from Toulouse, France-based startup Skyted. The company, founded by former Airbus VP St\u00e9phane Hersen and acoustical engineer Frank Simon, will showcase its innovative \u201cMobility Privacy Mask\u201d and \u201cHybrid Silent Mask\u201d at the event. These face-worn accessories are designed to absorb voice frequencies in noisy environments such as planes, trains, and rideshares, offering a unique solution for individuals seeking privacy in public spaces.\nKey Takeaway\nSkyted's \"Mobility Privacy Mask\" and \"Hybrid Silent Mask\" offer a novel solution for individuals seeking privacy in noisy environments, with potential applications spanning transportation, gaming, and military sectors.\nThe Innovative Masks\nAt CES 2024, Skyted is set to introduce its groundbreaking \"Mobility Privacy Mask\" and \"Hybrid Silent Mask.\" These innovative accessories are designed to absorb voice frequencies in noisy environments, providing users with the ability to converse in silence, even in bustling public settings.\nUnique Features and Functionality\nThe masks, crafted from sound-dampening material originally developed for jet engines, are equipped with a smartphone app that allows users to toggle a pass-through feature, enabling speech to be transmitted through the phone's speaker without the need to remove the mask. Additionally, the app provides insights into the wearer's \"voice level,\" \"perceptibility,\" and \"intelligibility,\" akin to a Fitbit for speech.\nTesting and Potential Applications\nSkyted claims that its masks can muffle 80% of a wearer's voice while enhancing volume in voice and video calls by isolating outside noise. The company has reportedly conducted tests with leading transportation providers and has garnered support from ONERA and the European Space Agency. Furthermore, Skyted has explored diverse applications for its masks, including features for gaming, defense, and military use, with a custom mask developed exclusively for submariners and special ops.\nMarket Prospects and Funding\nDespite the unconventional nature of the masks and the high starting price of $299, Skyted secured approximately $1 million in seed funding last year. The company's ambitious approach to addressing various sectors, coupled with its innovative technology, suggests potential market opportunities beyond traditional expectations.\nPost navigation\nPrevious\nGoogle\u2019s DeepMind Reveals New Methods For Training Robots With Video And Large Language Models\nNext\nHow To Hook Up Plantronics Rig Flex 3.5Mm Gaming Headset To Xbox One\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

        "raw_content": "The Skyted mask makes you quiet enough to take calls even in a library\nDemoed at CES 2024, it reduces sound by 25 decibels so even someone standing next to you can't make out what you're saying.\nI don't like talking on the phone in public. Often, I'm gossiping about something I have no business discussing around other people, or I'm talking about some tech product that has yet to be launched. That's why a product like Skyted's Silent Mask entices me. The company launched its Kickstarter campaign today at CES 2024 for its noise-reducing wearable that would allow you to speak freely about confidential information anywhere without worrying about people around you hearing. It's already broken its $8,800 goal many times over, and as of this writing it's raised $54,000, meaning it's a concept that resonated with many people.\nI'm skeptical of most Kickstarter projects, given the high likelihood they're vaporware, but the Skyted prototype I checked out here at the show felt solid. It didn't have an elastic head strap for me to put it on my head, so I had to hold it to my face while I tested it, but that aside the mask felt well-made. More importantly, the device actually worked.\nI had to temper my expectations slightly, but otherwise I was impressed. The mask isn't made to completely eliminate noise or let you scream your primal rage out in the middle of a restaurant and still remain unheard. Or, if you're an aspiring Broadway singer like me, it won't completely mute your belted out ballads. It will, however, reduce sound by 25 decibels so if you're speaking at a normal volume, the person next to you won't hear what you're saying.\nMy colleague Mat Smith was kind enough to join me for part of the demo so I could talk to him while putting the mask on and off my face. When I had the mask on, Mat, who stood right next to me, was sometimes unaware I was speaking. I kept my volume at a consistent level, which was slightly louder than I'd normally speak, given the noise around us on the showfloor. Even without Mat's validation, I could tell that what I was saying was noticeably muffled, to the point where if I had to talk about embargoed or confidential information in public, I would feel certain no one can hear the contents of my conversations. Now, I do need to point out that I did struggle to breathe at some points when trying on the Skyted mask, but that probably has more to do with how tightly I was pressing it to my face than the actual fit.\nThe mask uses technology similar to recent models of jet engines, which use resonators to draw sound away and into chambers. That way, the waves dissipate in a controlled environment instead of being leaked and overheard. There are little holes in the middle of the inside of the mask, and 12mm chambers on either side of the face. A microphone sits inside the mask, and, depending on the model of the device, can connect to your phone or laptop via Bluetooth or a wire. It has audio jacks onboard for input and output, so you can hear both yourself and the other people on your call.\nThe Skyted is currently available for an early bird starting price of $299 on Kickstarter, though after the introductory period it will cost $100 more. There are quite a few applications for a mask that helps keep your realworld conversations private, like allowing people to take meetings on their commutes. Skyted CEO Stephane Hersen said that talking on the phone is illegal on some trains in Europe, which means passengers on longer routes can't take work calls if they need. With Skyted, they would be able to. Hersen, who says he previously worked as a VP at Airbus, believes there are applications in education as well.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

Users wear a bluetooth-enabled mask that connects to their smartphones and keeps their voice contained in a private space for public phone calls. Mobility Mask advertises their product as privacy protecting and is designed with an aerospace sourced acoustic absorber that both absorbs and confines voice vibrations to be maintained within the mask.\nbenefits of the mask\nA short demonstration provided confirmed that people next to the person wearing the mask are only able to hear muffled sounds and thus unable to distinguish words the talker is saying. Skyted promotes this mask for frequent travelers or regular commuters, such as those working in airplanes, in an office, ridesharing in a vehicle, or in any public space.\ntwo versions for purchase\nThe Mobility Mask ensures user comfort thanks to the airflow surrounding the mask and comfortable material. The Mask is available in two versions: a wired USB-C model called the Skyted Wired priced at $399 and a wireless Bluetooth model known as the Skyted Bluetooth priced at $599. The latter comes with a 10 hour battery life. Both versions are available on Kickstarter and expected to deliver at the end of 2024.\nBen\nThe complex integration of buildings and automobiles always intrigued Ben. So much so that he dedicated his life to further his knowledge of technological development in building design. Whether he\u2019s on a job site with new homes or in a studio designing a home, Ben understands the smarts required inside a home.\nAI was the single biggest talking point at CES 2024, with every company delivering some sort of advancement of artificial intelligence into their products. After a strong showing of AI advancements on their lifestyle products at the show, Samsung is now ready to introduce AI into their smartphone division with the newly announced Galaxy S24 series. In fact, the tagline of the unveiling was \u201cGalaxy AI is here\u201d and boy is there a lot to unpack.\nIt\u2019s a new year and that means it is time for a refresh of products from Xiaomi\u2019s budget brand, Redmi. The Chinese giant announced the new lineup of Redmi Note 13 phones for the 2024 calendar year that includes the standard Note 13, the Note 13 5G, the Note 13 Pro, the Note 13 Pro 5G, and the Note 13 Pro+ 5G. Always the provider of quality value, Redmi has a product for just about every customer in varying price ranges.\nAt their gigantic CES 2024 booth, we were shocked to see a Nio ES8 on display surrounded by augmented reality glasses. This Chinese EV SUV is a rare sight on American soil as it is currently only sold in China and certain European countries.\nAt Razer\u2019s booth during CES 2024, the center attraction piece was none other than the upcoming refreshed, Razer Blade 18 laptop. This beauty has Razer\u2019s largest screen size available and will get a bit of a resolution bump in a tradeoff with the refresh rate numbers.\nBack in October, Pebble unveiled its all-electric flagship trailer: the Pebble Flow.

        "raw_content": "This startup is bringing a \u2018voice frequency absorber\u2019 to CES 2024\nCES has always been the place for weird, out-there gadgets to make their debuts, and this year\u2019s show is no exception.\nSkyted, a Toulouse, France-based startup founded by former Airbus VP St\u00e9phane Hersen and acoustical engineer Frank Simon, is bringing what look like a pair of human muzzles to CES 2024. Called the \u201cMobility Privacy Mask\u201d and \u201cHybrid Silent Mask,\u201d the face-worn accoutrements are designed to \u201cabsorb voice frequencies\u201d in noisy environments like plains, trains and rideshares, Hersen says.\n\u201cSkyted\u2019s solution is ideal for commuters, business executives and travelers anywhere,\u201d Hersen is quoted as saying in a press release. \u201cNo matter how busy or public the location is, they can now speak in silence and with the assurance that no one nearby can hear their conversation.\u201d\nImage Credits: Skyted\nNow, there\u2019s no getting around the fact that the strap-secured masks aren\u2019t exactly indiscreet or stylish\u2026 unless the Dyson Zone tickled your fancy. And at around half a pound (220 grams), they\u2019re not exactly lightweight, either. But Hersen makes the case that the tradeoffs are worth it for the privacy the masks (allegedly) afford.\nSkyted\u2019s masks are built from sound-dampening material that Simon developed while at ONERA, the French aerospace lab \u2014 originally for jet engines. They sync (via wire or wirelessly) to a smartphone app that offers a pass-through toggle to pipe speech through the phone\u2019s speaker \u2014 minimizing the need to remove the mask. The app also calculates the wearer\u2019s \u201cvoice level\u201d and shows insights into their \u201cperceptibility\u201d and \u201cintelligibility,\u201d sort of like a Fitbit for speech.\nThe masks muffle 80% of a wearer\u2019s voice, Skyted claims, while enhancing the volume in voice and video calls by isolating outside noise. And they\u2019ve been tested with \u201cleading\u201d (albeit unnamed) transportation providers, with backing from both ONERA and the European Space Agency.\nTo this reporter, though, the masks look like a shot in the dark. Skyted\u2019s marketing suggests as much.\nOn its website, Skyted advertises\u2026 unusual in-app features like a \u201cvoice awareness\u201d mode that lets parents quiet their noisy mask-donning kids while they\u2019re playing video games. (It\u2019s not totally clear how this works; perhaps active noise cancellation?) Skyted, in fact, pitches the masks as a more \u201cimmersive\u201d way to play games and even has a section of its website dedicated to defense and military applications. Skyted claims to have worked with the French military and the Defence Innovation Agency, France\u2019s military R&D arm, to develop a custom mask exclusively for submariners and special ops.\nImage Credits: Skyted\nSkyted appears to be testing a medical mask of some sort too \u2014 which, taken with all the other sectors it\u2019s going after, suggests a lack of focus. The scattershot go-to-market \u2014 coupled with the eye-watering $299 starting price and low-tech competition \u2014 doesn\u2019t bode well for Skyted\u2019s upcoming Kickstarter.\nThen again, Skyted managed to secure ~$1 million in seed funding last year, according to Crunchbase data. Perhaps there\u2019s a bigger market for face-mounted, sound-absorbing wearables than I thought."
