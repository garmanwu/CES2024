        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Govee pioneers AI-based lighting with CogniGlow and AI Lighting Bot\nSmart lighting is one of the best implementations of the modern smart home. With the right set up, you don\u2019t have to get up to turn on or off lights anymore. You can call out to a voice assistant, interact with an app on your phone, or set up automatic schedules and timers. But what if there was a way to level it up even more? Govee, a pioneer in home entertainment lighting and the first to introduce AI lighting technologies, aims to do just that. With two brand new AI implementations called CogniGlow and AI Lighting Bot we can all unlock truly, next-generation experiences.\nGovee will be showing off both technologies at CES 2023, from January 9 through 12, at the Venetian Expo in booth 53632. Of course, not everyone will be able to attend, so let\u2019s break down these new AI-powered solutions and what they have to offer.\nLearn More\nWhat is CogniGlow?\nCogniGlow is an AI-powered lighting algorithm that\u2019s intelligent, immersive, and truly next-level. The idea is to both sync and control smart lighting solutions to integrate with a bevy of platforms. For example, its AI gaming lighting supports popular games like Valorant, APEX, Fortnite, and a ton of others \u2014 Genshin Impact is compatible too. CogniGlow analyzes in-game actions to provide dedicated AI game lighting effects, emphasizing key moments as you play. But games aren\u2019t the only compatible platform. You can also sync movies to take your cinematic viewing experience to new heights, creating an immersive home theater environment that you\u2019ll never get anywhere else, even a traditional movie theater.\nThe AI model is trained to identify key visual features while gaming or watching movies, such as interactive elements, onscreen events, and scene color schemes. It will then generate dynamic and immersive lighting sequences to match the action.\nExplosions, parachuting out of the bus in Fortnite, high-speed jets flying overhead, guns blazing, none of it will ever be the same.\nWhat is Govee\u2019s AI Lighting Bot?\nGovee\u2019s second AI-powered technology is an AI Lighting Bot to revolutionize effect and sync experiences.\nBy integrating AIGC (Artificial Intelligence Generated Content), the AI Lighting Bot makes it possible to create vibrant lighting effects and experiences through voice and ambient elements. The bot can analyze user input via voice, text and even images in the future, generated ambient lighting data, with colors, images, and movements, to create adaptive and responsive lighting effects. This can then be leveraged for a variety of scenarios, from home entertainment and party effects to illuminating special events or public venues.\nFor example, you can say, \u201cI want Spider-Man lighting effects\u201d while watching your favorite Marvel character. Or, you could ask for \u201cBoston Celtics lighting effects\u201d while viewing a game. Want something more romantic? Ask for a \u201cheartbeat lighting scene\u201d with red hues. There are already a ton of options available, but Govee will continue adding new effects and possibilities to expand the AI Lighting Bot\u2019s capabilities.\nIntroducing the Govee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nSeveral upcoming products will feature these AI technologies from Govee, but one worth keeping an eye on is its AI Sync Box Kit 2. Featuring HDMI 2.1, increased bandwidth, and support for high-resolution formats like 4K at 120Hz, and up to 8K, this box plugs into HDMI devices to sync and automatically activate relevant lighting effects. It\u2019s particularly beneficial for gamers, as it\u2019s equipped with the new Govee CogniGlow technology. It intuitively recognizes and matches gaming highlights without manual input. It comes bundled with RGBICW strip lights and light bars, as well as Matter compatibility \u2014 it works with Govee Home, Alexa, Google Assistant, and Matter-enabled devices.\nAs the leading smart lighting provider, Govee is certainly ahead of the curve here with its AI-powered solutions. If you have the chance, you should definitely pay a visit to their booth at CES. But for anyone interested in these products, there are more details to come.\nLearn More\nChoosing a home security camera can be a daunting task since there are a lot of things to consider. Some aren\u2019t susceptible to power outages, thanks to their battery power and local storage, while others need careful placements inside or outside the home.\nWe recommend starting with something like the Arlo Pro 4 Spotlight Camera, a well-rounded camera that\u2019s packed full of features and boasts performance that ensures you\u2019ll be in the know about what\u2019s happening at your home. Competitors like Ring and Nest may be more recognizable brands, but the Arlo Pro 4 has them beat on features for the price. If you're not sold on the Arlo product, here's a look at the best security cameras of 2024.\nGoogle is dropping support for Nest Secure on April 8, at which time users will see a complete shutdown of its features. Whether you're using it as a bridge for your smart lock or as a home security system, the device will no longer connect to the internet, rendering it obsolete.\nGoogle has already reached out to impacted users to let them know about the impending shutdown, but is there a replacement for Nest Secure available in 2024? And what exactly can you do to prepare for the discontinuation in April? Here's a look at everything you need to know about Nest Secure.\nCheck ADT for a Nest Secure replacement\nIf you\u2019ve recently landed yourself one of the best laptops or one of the best desktop computers you may find yourself in need of a way to get comfortable in front of it.

The company previously released TV ambient lights with a camera you'd point at your television. The camera would stare at the screen, then pass along a signal to the lights to \"extend\" colors for a more immersive effect. But the camera system stood out and wasn't always accurate.\nThe AI Sync Box helped solve that problem by reading the video signal directly from an HDMI cord, delivering more accurate colors. And thanks to built-in AI, Govee even produced extra visual effects in specific games. But the original sync box didn't support HDMI 2.1, which inhibited its appeal to gamers. With the Sync Box between your TV and gaming system, you'd lose access to 4K 120Hz gameplay. That's where the AI Sync Box Kit 2 improves on the original.\nThe new Sync Box supports HDMI 2.1, which gets you up to 8K resolution. However, if you want a 120Hz refresh rate, you'll have to step down to 4K resolution. For most gamers, that should be more than enough. Govee also says it improved on the AI to get even more accurate colors, though the company didn't specify if the extra effects now work in more games. You'll still get the sync box, an LED strip, and two light bars in the kit.\nGovee also announced the Neon Rope Light 2. The updated rope light is more bendable and positionable than the last model and comes with new bend clips to allow new shapes that weren't possible before. Govee showed off a rope light bent in the image of a dolphin.\nThe Govee app will get an update that lets you program the rope light with your camera to recognize the shape and provide better lighting options that make full use of the rope light. The Neon Rope Light 2 will work with Alexa and Google Assistant, and later this year, will get a Matter update as well.\nThe company also announced a collaboration with Corsair that will integrate products from the two companies. Soon, you'll be able to synchronize Corsair RGB peripherals with Govee smart lights and bulbs. You might show PC temperature on your Neon Rope Light 2, for instance, or notifications from games. But that feature will roll out later in Q1.\nGovee didn't announce pricing for the new AI Sync Box 2 or the Neon Rope Light 2, but they'll be available sometime in the first half of 2024.\nAbout Josh Hendrickson\nFrom nearly the moment he could spell \u201ccomputer,\u201d Josh Hendrickson has been fascinated by Windows, PCs, and the electronics that have become an integral part of life.

This is a popular brand here at 9to5Toys, and we are excited to witness the next generation in smart gaming and home devices with CES 2024\u2019s opening tomorrow. Amongst the lineup are the new AI gaming sync box kit 2, which will support higher resolutions with dynamic lighting synchronization, as well as the upgraded Matter-supported Neon Rope Light 2 which is made from a more flexible material that allows for better shaping of the light to fit your designs. Head below to learn about all the exciting new releases from Govee during CES 2024.\nWhat\u2019s new with Govee for CES 2024\nFollowing the success of the first-generation AI Sync Box Kit at CES 2023, Govee has returned this year to redefine the gaming landscape with the release of the next AI Sync Box Kit 2. This cutting-edge system will support resolutions up to 8K and delivers seamless 4K resolution at 120Hz.\nGovee\u2019s CogniGlow AI recognition technology is the driving force behind these innovations, automatically activating tailored lighting effects based on in-game content and giving you a more personalized experience in any gaming moment. The system will support integration with Govee Home, Alexa, and Google Assistant, offering up broader compatibility and easier control \u2013 and it will get a Matter-compatible update via OTA later this year.\nThere is also the new take on an old fan favorite in the form of the second-generation Neon Rope Lights. Not only have the RGBIC lighting effects been improved for smoother performance, but it also features upgraded bend clips and a more flexible material that makes shaping the light to your desired designs far more effortless than before.\nGovee has also incorporated a new way to customize your lighting effects through the Govee Home app, where the camera uses shape recognition to apply a variety of DIY lighting effects throughout the different lighting segments. It is also Matter-compatible for seamless integration with your current smart home setup for seamless control.\nGoveeLife, a sub-brand that operates independently, is also expanding its extensive range of smart home appliances with two new devices at CES 2024. The first is a Presence Sensor that is ideal for anyone looking for more ways to secure their homes, with precise detection that covers a 120-degree range both horizontally and vertically. Not only is installation designed to be easier, but it also offers cross-platform interconnection and can be controlled via the Govee Home app. The company has also announced a Matter-certified Smart Plug Pro that will also help you achieve cross-platform control for any smart home device.\nGovee believes that AI technology will continue to empower smart lighting and smart home products in the coming years, which has led the company to create its AI Lighting Bot (an AIGC: Artificial Intelligence Generated Content). This new feature will be included in the brand\u2019s lighting solutions to bring a new level of interactivity to the market.\nAIGC technology adapts and responds to different scenarios, providing dynamic and responsive lighting to match the situation. Whether you\u2019ll be utilizing lights for home entertainment setups, public venue performances, or special events, the AIGC-enhanced lighting ensures a unique and engaging atmosphere.\nThe last of these major announcements has to do with Govee\u2019s partnership with CORSAIR to take gameplay experiences to new heights by integrating smart lighting into CORSAIR\u2019s iCUE software ecosystem. Users will now be able to control and synchronize the lighting effects of both companies\u2019 RGB peripherals and light bulbs/strips.

        "raw_content": "Tech trends at CES 2024 point to transformational change\nCanva\nSmart home expert Brandon Doyle checked out this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show, highlighting tech elements today\u2019s homebuyers and homeowners want to know more about.\nInman Connect\nThis January marks Inman\u2019s fifth annual Agent Appreciation Month, which culminates at Inman Connect New York in a celebration of agents at the end of January. Plus, we\u2019re rolling out the coveted Inman Power Player Awards, as well as the New York Power Brokers and MLS Innovators awards.\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, otherwise known as CES 2024, is the premier global event showcasing the latest technological innovations. It has been a spectacle of advancements, particularly in the realm of smart home technology.\nAs real estate professionals, understanding these developments is crucial for navigating the evolving landscape of homebuyer preferences and market trends. Here are some of this year\u2019s most significant tech trends from CES 2024 and their potential impact on the real estate industry.\nAI: The buzzword of the year\nArtificial intelligence (AI) was a pervasive theme at CES 2024, featured in almost every product category. From smart appliances to home security, AI\u2019s integration promises enhanced efficiency, personalization and user experience.\nFor instance, Govee\u2019s AI-powered lighting solutions create dynamic scenes for various home settings, suggesting a future where home environments adapt intelligently to occupants\u2019 needs.\nRevolutionary home appliances\nLG\u2019s showcase included a transparent screen and an energy-efficient washer/dryer combo, emphasizing space-saving and energy conservation \u2014 two key considerations for modern homeowners.\nWhirlpool introduced SlimTech Insulation in refrigerators, 66 percent thinner yet offering 25 percent more capacity, which signifies a leap in appliance efficiency and design.\nElectric vehicles (EVs) and home integration\nDuring Sony\u2019s press conference, the Afeela was driven on stage with a PlayStation controller and remote technology. Not to be outdone, BMW had a demonstration where they were driving a car completely remotely from a location offsite with a traditional steering wheel, peddles and screens which imitated the actual car.\nMeanwhile, Honda showcased concept cars, hinting at the future of EV design and its influence on residential EV charging solutions. While these concepts may not come to market anytime soon, they illustrate the growing synergy between home technology and automotive advancements.\nLighting and power management innovations\nGE Lighting, a Savant company, has expanded its product lines with dynamic lighting effects and integrated power management systems. The ability to manage energy consumption and backup power solutions like the ones offered by Savant, EcoFlow, Emporia and others will become more commonplace in years to come.\nSmart locks and home security\nAdvances in smart locks, such as U-tec\u2019s compatibility with Apple Key and Lockly\u2019s Visage with facial recognition, offer enhanced security features, a key selling point in the modern home security market.\nSecuram, U-Tec and Aqara are all expanding into other smart home categories, which reflects the growing demand for integrated, comprehensive home automation systems. Now, when you unlock your front door, it could turn on a light or disarm your security system.\nCleaning and maintenance: Robot vacuums and lawnmowers\nRoborock introduced advanced robot vacuums with AI detection, voice control and multi-function capabilities, indicating a shift towards more autonomous home maintenance. Narwal demonstrated innovative designs like anti-tangle brushes and dirty water detection, highlighting convenience and efficiency. Dreame added a TriCut brush to its flagship robot vacuum, which eliminates tangles from hair.\nBoth Ecovacs and Dreame announced robot lawnmowers, and Yarbo demonstrated its modular lawnmower/snowblower. These systems all use advanced GPS and other sensors to operate autonomously within a defined area without installing a guide wire.\nCameras and surveillance\nReolink has a new line of point-of-entry, dual-lens cameras along with enhanced Wi-Fi cameras with AI recognition, tracking, and a new base station to record footage locally. Abode announced the world\u2019s first Wi-Fi HaLow, Ultra Long Range, battery-powered, AI-enabled smart home security camera with a range of over one mile.\nFor real estate professionals, these technological advancements offer a new dimension for property listings and marketing. Highlighting features like energy-efficient appliances, integrated EV charging solutions, advanced home security systems and AI-powered maintenance tools can significantly enhance a property\u2019s appeal to tech-savvy buyers.\nMoreover, understanding these trends enables Realtors to advise clients on potential upgrades that can increase a property\u2019s value and appeal in a competitive market. As smart home technology becomes a standard expectation rather than a luxury, Realtors who are knowledgeable about these innovations will be better equipped to meet the demands of a rapidly evolving real estate landscape.\nCES 2024 has not only unveiled cutting-edge technology but has also set the tone for future home design and functionality. For the real estate industry, these advancements are not just gadgets and gizmos but essential components of the modern, connected home that appeals to a new generation of homebuyers.\nBrandon Doyle is a Realtor at\u00a0Doyle Real Estate Team \u2014 RE/MAX Results\u00a0in Minneapolis and co-author of\u00a0Mindset, Methods & Metrics \u2013 Winning as a Modern Real Estate Agent.\u00a0You can follow him on\u00a0Twitter.\nRead next\nRead Next\nSimply enter the email address you used to create your account and click \"Reset Password\".

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.
