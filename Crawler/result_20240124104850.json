        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

It is expected that extension programmes will help increase farm productivity, farm revenue, reduce poverty and minimize food insecurity. In this study, we estimate the effects of extension services on farm productivity and income with particular reference to agricultural extension services delivered by Association of Church-based Development NGOs (ACDEP).\nMethods\nThe study used cross-sectional data collected from 200 farm households from two districts in the Northern region of Ghana. The robustness of the estimates was tested by the use of regression on covariates, regression on propensity scores and Heckman treatment effect model.\nResults\nThe study found positive economic gains from participating in the ACDEP agricultural extension programmes. Apart from the primary variable of interest (ACDEP agricultural extension programme), socio-economic, institutional and farm-specific variables were estimated to significantly affect farmers\u2019 farm income depending on the estimation technique used.\nConclusions\nThe study has reaffirmed the critical role of extension programmes in enhancing farm productivity and household income. It is, therefore, recommended that agricultural extension service delivery should be boosted through timely recruitment, periodic training of agents and provision of adequate logistics.\nBackground\nThe millennium development goals (MDGs) of reducing hunger and to promote food security are rooted in increasing agricultural productivity, especially from the crop sector. This is because agriculture is considered as the engine of growth in many developing economies, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). The policy direction of growth and poverty reduction strategy (GPRS II) formulated by Ghana was to achieve accelerated and sustainable growth and poverty reduction through agricultural productivity. Although poverty had declined by 7.7% over the years (2005\u20132013), about 25% of Ghana\u2019s population is still poor while under a tenth of the population are living in extreme poverty [1]. This suggests that the role of agriculture has not been sufficient to elevate many people above the poverty line, especially the rural folks who contribute immensely to agricultural production in Ghana. Ghana\u2019s agricultural sector, which employs about 42% of the workforce, is dominated by smallholder farmers (about 90% farming on less than 2 hectares of land) who are using traditional production methods and farm inputs [2]. Asfaw et al. [3] argue that achieving productivity growth in the agricultural sector can only be successful through the development and dissemination of improved agricultural technologies to these smallholder farmers in the rural areas. Rural farmers farming on small hectares of land can be attributed to conditions such as lack of adequate credit, lack of access to product market, lack of adequate extension contacts, among others. Among these constraints, inadequate extension services have been identified as one of the main limiting factors to the growth of the agricultural sector and rural community development at large [3]. With recent threats of climate change and the rapid advancement in technology, more farmers require capital investment in agriculture and human capacity development to at least continue to make their living out of farming. Thus, the role of agricultural extension today goes beyond the transfer of technology and improvement in productivity, but also, it includes improvement in farmers\u2019 managerial and technical skills through training, facilitation and coaching, among others.\nIncognizant of these problems, the government of Ghana through the Ministry of Food and Agriculture (MoFA) over the years has invested so much in building the capacities of smallholder farmers through agricultural extension programmes. Other stakeholders in the agricultural sector such as international and local funding agencies, non-governmental organizations and financial institutions have and continue to make investments in the delivery of extension services to farmers. One of the prominent NGOs that have been implementing extension programmes in Northern Ghana is the Association of Church-based Development NGOs (ACDEP). ACDEP is a network of over 40, mostly, but not only church sponsored development NGOs in Northern Ghana with the vision of improving the economic well-being of its actors, particularly farmers through improved farm technology and access to input and output markets. The ACDEP NGOs are also engaged in other fields such as primary health care, HIV/AIDS, water and sanitation, rural enterprise development for women and value chains. One of the key components of ACDEP programmes in the field of agriculture is the delivery of agricultural extension services.\nThe ACDEP agricultural extension programmes include capacity building in good agricultural practices (GAPs), creating linkages among the value chain actors (input dealers, farmers, wholesalers and retailers) and other value addition techniques.Footnote 1 Thus, wider dissemination of information regarding farmer skill development, the use of improved farm technologies, general farm management practices and easy access to input and output markets have been the fundamental principles underlying delivery of ACDEP agricultural extension services. All these are geared towards improvement in productivity, reduction in poverty and enhancement in food security.Footnote 2 Given the scale of investment from ACDEP, the value for money regarding an increase in farm income is an important policy question. In this study, we hypothesized that participation in ACDEP agricultural extension programmes positively affects the welfare of the participating farm households through improvement in farm productivity and income. Many studies had dealt with issues relating to improving agricultural technologies such as improved crop varieties, adoption of fertilizer,\u00a0etc. in Ghana [4,5,6,7,8]. Also, some other studies had focused on the impact of government extension programmes concerning the use of technology, adoption rates, farm productivity and efficiency, and farm output levels [9]. These studies had provided excellent information on factors shaping adoption and adoption intensities of farm technologies. However, rigorous studies on impact evaluation of agricultural extension services delivered by non-governmental organizations such as ACDEP on smallholders\u2019 farm productivity and income remain very rare in the Ghanaian agricultural literature. Thus, there are many gaps with regard to what is known about the effects of extension services on the productivity and income of farmers\u2014the body of empirical evidence does not match the scale of implementation, particularly in Ghana\u2019s agricultural sector. Hence, the aim of the study is to estimate the effects of agricultural extension services with particular reference to ACDEP on the farm productivity and income of smallholder farmers in the ACDEP operational areas in the Northern region of Ghana.\nThe role of extension services in agriculture\nAgricultural extension programmes have been one of the main conduits of addressing rural poverty and food insecurity. This is because, it has the means to transfer technology, support rural adult learning, assist farmers in problem-solving and getting farmers actively involved in the agricultural knowledge and information system [10]. Extension is defined by FAO [11] as; \u201csystems that should facilitate the access of farmers, their organizations and other market actors to knowledge, information and technologies; facilitate their interaction with partners in research, education, agribusiness, and other relevant institutions; and assist them to develop their own technical, organizational and management skills and practices\u201d. By this definition, an extension is deemed as a primary tool for making agriculture, its related activities as well as other economic activities more effective and efficient to meet the needs of the people. It is, therefore, regarded as a policy tool for promoting the safety and quality of agricultural products. Agricultural extension is aimed primarily at improving the knowledge of farmers for rural development; as such, it has been recognized as a critical component for technology transfer. Thus, agricultural extension is a major component to facilitate development since it plays a starring role in agricultural and rural development efforts [12].\nBonye et al. [12] argued that extension provides a source of information on new technologies for farming communities which when adopted can improve production, incomes and standards of living. Extension service providers make an innovation known to farm households, act as a catalyst to speed up adoption rate and also control change and attempt to prevent some individuals in the system from discontinuing the diffusion process [13]. In reaching farmers, extension officers demonstrate a technology to farmers but with much concentration on early adopters since the laggards would learn later from the early adopting farmers. Through extension services, farmers\u2019 problems are identified for further investigation and policy direction. Swanson [14] argued that extension service goes beyond technology transfer to general community development through human and social capital development, improving skills and knowledge for production and processing, facilitating access to markets and trade, organizing farmers and producer groups, and working with farmers towards sustainable natural resource management. Where market failures such as limited access to credit and non-competitive market structures that provide a disincentive to farmers to produce exist, extension services tend to provide solutions.\nMethods\nThe study area, data source and description of variables\nThe study analyses the effects of ACDEP extension programmes on farm productivity and income using a sample obtained from the farming communities in the Tolon and Kumbugu districts of the Northern region of Ghana. The two districts are predominantly rural communities with the majority being smallholder farm households. Tolon district has a population of 72,990 (males constitute 49.8% while females constitute 50.2%) of which 92.7% are engaged in agriculture, while Kumbugu has a population of 39,341 (equally distributed between males and females, i.e. 50%) of which 95.4% of the households are engaged in agriculture [15]. Crop farming is the main agricultural activities in the two districts with about 98% engaged in it [15]. The districts are characterized by a single rainy season, which starts in late April with little rainfall, rising to its peak in July\u2013August and declining sharply after that and coming to a complete halt in October\u2013November. The dry season starts from November to March with day temperatures ranging from 33 to 39\u00a0\u00b0C, while mean night temperature ranges from 20 to 26\u00a0\u00b0C. The mean annual rainfall ranges between 950 and 1200\u00a0mm.\nThe data were obtained mainly from primary sources, through the use of structured questionnaires. The study followed a multi-stage random sampling technique in selecting the two districts and communities from the Northern region and farm households from each community. In the first stage, the two districts were randomly selected from a number of ACDEP operational districts in the Northern region of Ghana. In the second stage, a random sampling was used to select four ACDEP operational communities from each district. Four non-ACDEP operational communities were selected from Tolon district, while three were selected from Kumbugu district. Thus, the survey covered fifteen communities, eight from Tolon and seven from Kumbugu. In the final stage, 10\u201315 maize farm households were randomly selected from each operational community, while 10\u201312 maize farm households were selected from each of the non-operational communities. The total sample size of the study is 200 maize farm households consisting of 110 farm households who had participated in ACDEP extension programmes and 90 maize farm households who did not take part in the programme. Key informants such as some heads of departments of ACDEP office in Tamale, Ghana and community leaders were approached to discuss challenges and opportunities relating to the programme and how the programme can aid in increasing productivity and farm income.\nTable\u00a01 shows the descriptive statistics of the sampled farm households. Two main categories of variables are described here: the dependent variables (outcome variables) and the explanatory variables.\nThe dependent variables consist of maize farm productivity (yields), maize farm income per hectare, total household income and household income per capita. Farm productivity is defined as the total output of maize in kilograms per hectare.Footnote 3 The average yield of maize of the participating farm households is 1811\u00a0kg per hectare, while that of the non-participants is 1511\u00a0kg per hectare. Thus, there is no statistical\u00a0difference between yields of participants and non-participants of the ACDEP agricultural extension programme. However,\u00a0difference could partly be ascribed to the over-concentration of the programme on linking farmers to the output market with the adoption of farm technology lagging.\nThe income from maize (measured as the total sales per hectare) shows a difference of 20% in favour of the participants which is significant at 10% level of significance. One of the key components of the ACDEP agricultural extension programme is to link farmers to the output market, and so farmers who participated in the programme might have had their products sold at the right time compared with their counterparts who did not. As part of the programme, some of the participants were engaged in contract farming where their farm product was pre-negotiated. Hence, might be responsible for the significant difference in the farm income between the participants and non-participants. The total household income is the summation of the revenues from maize and other crops, revenues from the sales of livestock and income from non-farm economic activities such as wages, salaries and other self-employed businesses earned by members of the household (e.g. household head, spouse and other economically active members). The total household income per capita defines the total income of the households relative to their size. The total household income of the ACDEP participating households is GH\u00a2 13,710, while that of the non-participants is GH\u00a28239 showing a significant difference between the two groups.Footnote 4 Similarly, the total income per capita is GH\u00a22222 and GH\u00a2788 for participants and non-participants, respectively. The large difference in household income is partly coming from the gap in the farm income, and probably the treated group were more engaged in other farming activities such as livestock rearing due to the knowledge they might have gained through the programme. The difference in household income per capita may emanate from the fact that non-participating households have a larger family size compared to the participating households. However, these descriptive statistics are limited regarding their implications for causality, as they fail to quantify and account for selectivity biases that may emanate from participation in the extension programmes.\nConsistent with pieces of literature, the study hypothesized that participation in the ACDEP extension programme, as well as the determinants of farmers\u2019 farm income, can be explained by socio-economic, farm-specific and institutional factors [9, 15,16,17]. Some of the socio-economic factors include gender, age, household size, the number of years in formal education and the number of years in crop farming (experience). The farm-specific factors included in the empirical models of this study are the hectare of agricultural land allocated to maize cultivation (farm size) and the number of maize farm plots. The institutional and policy variables include membership of a farmer-based organization (FBO), distance to the local district market and distance to the main regional city market as well as access to agricultural credit.\nEconometric technique\nThe study uses a combination of three econometric techniques to assess the effects of the ACDEP agricultural extension services on farm productivity and income of the smallholder maize farmers. First, we use a simple regression referred to as regression on covariates. Second, a regression on propensity scores was used to account for selectivity bias in estimating the effects of the extension services. In the third stage, we complement the results with the Heckman treatment effect model to test the robustness of the results.\nWe start by considering that the outcome variables (in our case maize farm yields, farm income per capita, total household income and total household income per capita) are a linear function. This linear function consists of a vector of households, farm-specific and institutional factors (Xi). The simplest approach to assessing the effect of the ACDEP agricultural extension programme is to include in the outcome equation ACDEP agricultural extension participation variable (AEi) denoting one (1) if farmer participates in the ACDEP programme and zero (0) if otherwise, and then apply ordinary least squares (OLS) estimation technique. This can be specified as:\nwhere Yi is the outcome variable, AEi is a dummy variable for ACDEP extension programme participation, Xi represents other explanatory variables, \u03b1i and \u03b4i are parameters to be estimated. The causal effect of AEi on the outcome variables can be measured by estimating the parameter \u03b1i. However, estimating Eq.\u00a0(1) with OLS might lead to biased estimates because it assumes that AEi is random and exogenously given, while the selection of ACDEP participants is non-random and AEi variable is potentially endogenous [16, 18]. The non-random sample selection problem arises from self-selection where the farmers themselves decide whether or not to participate in the extension programme, probably due to differences in resource endowments. Thus, the selection bias emanates from the fact that treated individuals may be systematically different from the non-treated for reasons other than the treatment status. The endogeneity problem may arise becuase the programme may target\u00a0farmers with specific characteristics (smallholder farmers, commercial farmers, poor farmers or relatively wealthy farmers). These may result in biased estimates of the coefficient of AEi which measures the effects of extension programme participation on the outcome variables. Selection bias could also arise from the selection on observable or unobservable. Selection on observables could be controlled by including some set of variables in the model. However, selection on unobservables is usually difficult to control by adding variables. This is because unobserved variables such as farmers\u2019 managerial ability, motivation, among others are not observed, hence, difficult to capture. Excluding these unobserved variables gives biased estimates of \u03b1i in Eq.\u00a0(1). The study addresses the problem of selectivity bias in three ways.\nThe first is to include a set of observable covariates to account for potential selection bias due to selection on observables as applied in [13]. These variables include distance to local district market, distance to regional city market and farm size. We can then re-specify Eq.\u00a0(1) as:\nwhere Zi is a vector of variables to control for the selection bias and \u03c7i is the parameter to be estimated. As stated earlier, this is called regression on covariates.\nThe second approach is to estimate the propensity score or conditional probability to participate in the ACDEP agricultural extension programme and use it as an additional control variable in the regression model.Footnote 5 This is referred to as regression on propensity scores as used in Alemu et al. [13] and Asres et al. [19]. The propensity score as a control variable in the regression model reduces the potential biases created by selection on observable characteristics [17]. The new regression model can be specified as:\nwhere \\(PS_{i} = p(AE_{i} = \\frac{1}{X})\\) and \u03c6i is the estimate of the propensity score PSi. Other variables are defined earlier.\nThe third approach to deal with sample selection bias is the Heckman treatment effect model. The Heckman treatment effect model is one of the most widely used procedure to account for sample selection bias and offers a mean/way of correcting for biases that may arise from unobservable factors, and thus results in unbiased and consistent estimates [16]. The Heckman treatment effect model is an extension of the Heckman two-stage model. The only difference is that the dependent variable in the selection equation becomes one of the explanatory variables in the outcome equation of the former but not in the latter model. The principle behind the treatment effect model is to estimate the selection equation (usually a probit model) and use the predicted values of the dependent variable as a selection control factor called the inverse mills ratio (IMR). The IMR is then used as an additional regressor in the outcome equation to correct sample selection and free other explanatory variables from any biases. In this way, the true effects of participation in the ACDEP agricultural extension programme on outcome variables are measured [20]. Thus, in the treatment effect model, the treatment condition enters the outcome equations as an explanatory variable to measure the true effects on the outcome variables [18].\nThe model can be specified in two steps. The selection equation which is usually a probit is given as:\nwhere AEi is a latent endogenous variable (participation in ACDEP agricultural extension programmes), Xi is a set of exogenous variables determining the selection of farm households into the extension programme, \u03b4i is a parameter to be estimated and \u025bi is the error term. The substantive equation can be specified as:\nwhere \u03b1i measures the effect of ACDEP extension services on the outcome variables. To correct for self-selection biases in the\u00a0substantive Eq.\u00a0(5), an IMR denoted by the symbol \u03bb was generated and added as an additional explanatory variable. The formulation process of IMR is given as:\nwhere \u03c6 and \u03a6 are normal probability density function and cumulative density function, respectively, of the standard normal distribution. Adding the IMR to Eq.\u00a0(5) translates into Eq.\u00a0(7) as:\nwhere \u03b3i is an estimate of the IMR (\u03bbi) and \u03bci is a two-sided error term with \\(N(0,\\sigma_{v}^{2} ).\\) The rest are as defined earlier. A significant coefficient of the IMR implies that there is self-selection problem, while a non-significant coefficient indicates the absence of sample selection. Ignoring the addition of the IMR will render the results from Eq.\u00a0(5) as biased [21]. Thus, the inclusion of the selectivity term makes the coefficient \u03b1i (measuring the effects of the treatment variable on the outcome variables) unbiased, albeit it is inefficient as the disturbance term (\u03bci) is heteroscedastic [16]. The problem of heteroscedasticity can be corrected by the use of bootstrap standard errors or re-sampling. However, the STATA software package used in generating the estimates automatically adjusts for that bias in the standard errors [22].\nEmpirical results and discussions\nDeterminants of ACDEP agricultural extension programme participation\nThe results from the probit model for the participation in ACDEP agricultural extension programme are presented in Table\u00a02. The model fits the data reasonably well as indicated by the Wald test that all the coefficients are jointly equal to zero\u00a0is rejected [Chi2 (8)\u00a0=\u00a028.37; p\u2009\u00a0=\u00a00.000].\nThe probit\u00a0model also correctly classified 69.37% of the maize farm households among the participants and 69.66% among the non-participants with a total accurate prediction rate of 69.50% for the entire sample.\nFrom the table, the probability of participating in the ACDEP extension programmes is significantly influenced by the age of the household head, the number of years in crop farming, access to agricultural credit, membership of a farmer-based organization and the size of plots allocated to maize production (farm size). The positive and significant influence of age on the probability of participation in the ACDEP agricultural extension programme is against the notion that older farmers are usually reluctant to accept new information and ideas as reported by Asres et al. [19] and Genius et al. [23]. However, the result is consistent with the studies by Tiwari et al. [24] and Mendola [25]. Farmers with longer years in farming business have a higher likelihood of participating in the ACDEP programmes to optimize their farm productivity and income. Hence, the positive and significant effect of this variable is expected.\nSimilarly, access to agricultural credit will encourage farmers to participate in the extension programme to get more information that may help to maximize their yield to repay the credit on time. Group membership such as FBO enhances farmer-to-farmer extension services where knowledge and ideas on farm business and other off-farm activities are transferred from one farmer to the other. Thus, farmers who are members of FBOs are likely to get sufficient awareness and knowledge on farm technologies and, hence, are sensitized to join extension programme for more information on their farm business. Similarly, participants in the ACDEP agricultural extension programme tend to have larger farm sizes than their non-participants counterparts as supported by the descriptive statistics in Table\u00a01. Usually, members of such extension programmes are encouraged to consider their farm as a business entity rather than a cultural way of life and are, therefore, poised to achieve higher output through expansion and productivity. Gebreegziabher [26] reported a positive effect of plot size on the probability of participating in an extension programme in Ethiopia.\nEffects of ACDEP extension programme on yield, farm income and household income\nThe econometric results of the effects of the extension programme on the four outcome variables (maize productivity, farm income per hectare, total household income and total household income per capita) are reported in Table\u00a03. These outcome variables are already defined in Table\u00a01. The following paragraphs discuss the effects of ACDEP agricultural extension programmes on each of the performance indicators across the three models.\nTable\u00a03 indicates that ACDEP agricultural extension programmes had positive effects on the productivity and farm income of the households in the study area. The results from different estimation approaches are quantitatively similar in terms of the direction, indicating the robustness of the results to changes in the estimation techniques. The estimated results show that the ACDEP extension programme had no significant effects on maize farm productivity when regression on covariates and regression on propensity scores were used. However, in the Heckman treatment effect model, the effect is positive and significant. Since all the variables are specified in logarithmic terms, it suggests that participating in the ACDEP extension programme has increased farm productivity by 11.3% points. The result from the Heckman model is at variance with the study of Feder et al. [27] who found no contribution of extension programmes to crop productivity. However, it is in line with other previous studies [28,29,30,31] reporting positive effects of extension programmes on crop farm productivity. The estimated effects for maize farm income per hectare vary from 0.113 to 1.13 depending on the estimation procedure. These coefficients imply that the extension programme has led to an increase in farm income by 11.3 to 111.3 percentage points. The effect is smaller in a regression on propensity score than the Heckman treatment effect model as indicated in Table\u00a03. The wide divergence in the magnitude of the effects may partly be attributed to the difference in the unobserved heterogeneity among the maize farm households. The regression on propensity score minimizes selection biases based on observed covariates, while Heckman treatment effects correct for selection bias arising from unobserved factors, hence, the two estimation techniques are most likely to produce different estimates. Moreover, given the market-oriented nature of the extension programmes nowadays, the large effect on farm income is not surprising. Thus, the focus is more on linking farmers to the market where products are purchased at the right time, rather than technology adoption.\nFor Heckman treatment effects, regression on propensity score and regression on covariate models, extension programmes lead to 85.3%, 23.3% and 36.1% increase in total household income, respectively. Gebrehiwot [9] observed that extension programmes lead to 7% and 10% points in farm household income when estimated with regression on covariates and propensity score matching using stratification technique, respectively. Similarly, Asres et al. [19] reported 6% and 18% increase in household income through participation in extension programme when estimated with OLS and Heckman treatment effects, respectively. The results also corroborate with that of [28] and [32]. The effects of ACDEP agricultural extension programmes on per capita income differ across the three models regarding the magnitudes of the effects. The extension programmes improve per capita income by 34.7% and 21.6% for regression on covariates and regression on the propensity scores, respectively. It increases by 110.4% in the Heckman treatment effect model. The greater impact of the ACDEP programme on the per capita income could emanate from the large effect of farm income coupled with the smaller household size of the participants compared with that of the non-participants as indicated in the descriptive statistics. Apart from participation in extension programme, some other factors have been estimated to affect farm households\u2019 income. Table\u00a04 presents the full results of the regression on covariates, regression on propensity scores and the second stage of the Heckman treatment model. The two regressions (regression on covariates and regression on propensity scores) are free from multicollinearity as indicated by the variance inflation factor (VIF) mean values of 1.39 and 2.65 for regression on covariates and regression on propensity scores, respectively. The VIF for each independent variable was less than the critical value of 10 indicating non-existence of multicollinearity [33]. The results are also free from heteroscedasticity as indicated by the small values of the Chi2 generated by the Breusch\u2013Pagan/Cook\u2013Weisberg heteroscedasticity test.\nThe results indicate the significance of household locations and their effects on their farm income. The distance to market centres, both local and regional markets, is found to negatively affect their farm income. These findings may be attributed to the fact that ACDEP programmes are targeted at the remote districts and communities where poverty is pervasive. The other side is that farmers sometimes find it difficult in transporting their produce to the urban market centres as they are being constrained by finance and other factors such as road networks.\nOther socio-economic factors such as the educational attainment (measured as the number of years in formal education), household size and farming experience (measured as the number of years in crop farming) significantly affect farm income with different estimation techniques. Similarly, institutional variables such as access to agricultural credit and social capital variable (FBO membership) are estimated to have positive and significant effects on farm income. The number of farm plots owned is positive and significant in the regression on propensity score but not significant in the regression on covariates and Heckman treatment effect model. Furthermore, the size of the plot allocated to maize production (farm size) had a positive and significant influence on farm income across the three estimation techniques. This underscores the importance of farm size to increasing farm income among smallholder rural farm households.\nConclusions\nThe study has assessed the effects of ACDEP agricultural extension programme on the productivity and income of farm households using primary data from two districts in the Northern region, Ghana. Since the agricultural extension programmes require\u00a0a substantial amount of investment,\u00a0understanding its effects on the beneficiaries (farmers) is very important. After controlling for selectivity bias, we found out that participation in the ACDEP agricultural extension programme improves welfare through an increase in farmers\u2019 income. However, the effect levels are different depending on the empirical estimation procedure adopted. The central government and development partners should commit more human, financial and logistical resources to agricultural extension delivery in the country to boost agricultural productivity, farm incomes and total household income. Also, access to agricultural credit and formation of farmer groups such as farmer-based organizations should be promoted for agricultural extension service delivery to realize its full impact.\nNotes\nThe study used \u201cACDEP extension programmes\u201d and \u201cACDEP agricultural extension programmes\u201d interchangeably.\nNote: Information in this paragraph was sourced from ACDEP website (http://acdep.org/site/index.php/home-7/14-acdep-home/24-about-acdep) and its secretariat office in Tamale, Ghana.\nIn this study, farm productivity and farm yields are used interchangeably.\nAverage exchange in 2016: GH\u00a2\u2009=\u2009US$ 1.\nNote: A probit model was used to generate the propensity scores used in Eq.\u00a0(3).\nAbbreviations\nAssociation of Church-based Development NGOs\nFood and Agriculture Organization\ngood agricultural practices\ngrowth and poverty reduction strategy II\nmillennium development goals\nordinary least squares\nsub-Saharan Africa\nReferences\nGhana Statistical Service.
