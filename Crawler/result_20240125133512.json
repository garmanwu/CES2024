Visitors will be able to drive a BMW iX remotely across the Silver Lot at the exhibition grounds, discover the potential of augmented reality glasses as passengers, and experience the power of BMW\u2019s Intelligent Personal Assistant as a vehicle expert enhanced with generative artificial intelligence.\nNew gaming highlights for the ConnectedDrive Store in BMW Operating System 9 for 2024.\nIn conjunction with the optional BMW Digital Premium offer, owners of BMWs with Operating System 9 have access to a BMW ConnectedDrive Store extended with third-party apps. This app store offers a constantly growing range of apps for music, news, and gaming. In the future, more games will be added via this channel, including games that can be played with full-fledged gaming controllers. BMW is presenting such a gaming experience for the first time at CES 2024 with \u201cBeach Buggy Racing 2\u201d offering customers an action-packed racing game experience that is reminiscent of the major console classics. In split-screen mode, two players can compete against each other in the vehicle with their gaming controllers. Common, Bluetooth-enabled gaming controllers can be connected to the infotainment system in just a few steps. The controller connection will be available over-the-air for BMW Operating System 9 over the course of 2024.\nWith the AirConsole app, BMW and MINI customers can already play single and multiplayer games in the vehicle today. The games are easily accessible to everyone, as the smartphone becomes a controller and enables simple, easy-to-learn operation. The range of games on the AirConsole app in the vehicle is constantly being developed.\nBMW models with BMW Operating System 9 come with a 90-day free trial of BMW Digital Premium, after which it can be added via the ConnectedDrive Store on the web, in the My BMW app, or directly in the vehicle. BMW Digital Premium also includes extended navigation functions and additional customization options, for example through additional My Modes.\nTop entertainment \u2014 with the Video App in BMW Operating Systems 8.5 and 9.\nIn addition to the BMW Theatre Screen with Amazon Fire TV built-in in the rear compartment of the BMW 7 Series, BMW customers are now able to watch a variety of video content on the central display*. BMW developers worked with XPERI, Inc. to optimize the TiVo Operating System \u2013 which has already been successful in the Smart TV sector \u2013 for in-vehicle video streaming, integrating the DTS AutoStage Video Service powered by TiVo. The entertainment offerings include both live channels and on-demand media libraries of news, sports, entertainment for children, movies, and TV series.\n* In vehicles with BMW Operating System 8.5 in conjunction with ConnectedDrive Professional; with BMW Operating System 9 in conjunction with BMW Digital Premium.** BMW 7 Series; BMW iX from 03/23 production, the BMW X5, BMW X6, BMW X7, BMW X5 M, BMW X6 M from 04/23 production and the BMW XM from 08/23 production.\nThe platform was first introduced in the new BMW 5 Series and is now being rolled out over-the-air to other luxury class models**. Owners of vehicles with BMW Operating System 9 have also had access to the video app in conjunction with BMW Digital Premium since the end of 2023, with other vehicles following in 2024, such as the BMW X2 and all models in the new MINI family.\nThe video app is now available in the USA, UK, South Korea, France, Italy, Germany, Spain and soon will be coming to Japan. The portals available across countries include Pluto TV, Bloomberg, TED, Yahoo! and Chili. There are also country-specific streaming offers:\nThe video streaming platform\u2019s portfolio will continue to develop and gradually roll out to other countries.\nReady for the wearables of the future \u2014 extended driving experience with \u201cXREAL Air 2\u201d augmented reality glasses.\nAt CES, BMW will show for the first time how augmented reality (AR) glasses could enrich the driving experience in the future. Visitors will experience the uses of AR glasses on a trip through Las Vegas. In doing so, they see how navigation and hazard information, information on points of interest and entertainment content are perfectly embedded in the real environment through the \u201cXREAL Air 2\u201d. AR and MR (mixed reality) devices will steadily gain in popularity in the coming years due to technological advances and more accessible entry-level models. These devices have the potential to provide both drivers and passengers with extended information and content \u2014 as a supplement to the displays installed in the vehicle.\nSince 2008, BMW has been following the development of AR/MR technology and has been investigating the possible uses of head-mounted displays as part of research projects. Through the resulting development collaborations, BMW engineers have succeeded for the first time in displaying stable augmented reality (AR) and mixed reality (MR) content to passengers in a moving vehicle. Even in challenging driving situations, for example when the vehicle turns, drives over bumps, or accelerates, the displayed image remains stable. To achieve this, the tracking system of the respective AR/MR device must be connected to the vehicle\u2019s sensor data.\nBMW has continuously expanded its experience with AR/MR devices over the years and presented it to the public, starting with the\u00a0MINI Augmented Vision project (2015), the\u00a0collaboration with Meta Reality Labs (2022 & 2023), the\u00a0ConnectedRide Smartglasses from BMW Motorrad, and the M Mixed Reality Driving Experience. In current BMW and MINI models, the \u201cAugmented View\u201d function offers the driver a live video stream on the display for the best possible orientation when navigating, which is expanded with additional, augmented information.\nBMW has already successfully pioneered digital technologies such as vehicle access based on the BMW Digital Key and has driven forward the standardization of such innovations in the industry. When it comes to AR/MR, the company is also open to cooperation with other partners to achieve the goal of creating an industry standard for connecting XR devices in the CE industry with vehicles.\nDevelopment demo: Voice assistant becomes the ultimate vehicle expert with the help of Amazon Alexa Large Language Model (LLM).\nBMW and Amazon are showcasing voice assistant LLM capabilities based on a current development project the companies are working on for a potential series rollout. This makes the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant the ultimate vehicle expert enabled by generative AI, powered by the Alexa LLM. Visitors will experience how the voice assistant provides quick instructions and answers about vehicle functions in a much more human, conversational manner, while at the same time being able to control some vehicle functions.\nThe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has been using artificial intelligence for speech processing for a long time, and this demo is the latest proof of the continued innovation BMW and its partners are bringing to customers. Complex processing capabilities, which enable human-like interactions and dialogs, had not yet been integrated into the existing Intelligent Personal Assistant. Such capabilities are now made possible by LLMs (Large Language Models), which are AI models designed to process human language at a high level and generate responses accordingly. The BMW Group is also taking careful steps to build a safe and trusted experience for customers, and continues to test and iterate these LLM capabilities over time with its partners.\nSince the introduction of the first BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant in 2018, language interaction has been an essential part of BMW iDrive. Today, the voice assistant gives customers control over many vehicle functions so that they can keep their hands on the wheel and their eyes on the road. Leveraging Amazon\u2019s Alexa Custom Assistant \u2014 a solution based on Alexa technology that enables companies to create their own customized voice assistant \u2014 the next generation of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant will soon become more powerful over the course of the year in vehicles with BMW Operating System 9.\nJoint development project with Valeo enables remote-controlled valet parking.\nBMW and Valeo are working in a strategic partnership on the joint development of next-generation automated Level 4 parking solutions. This also includes the development of solutions for automated valet parking (AVP). The customer leaves the vehicle at a defined drop off point. From there, the vehicle automatically searches for a parking space, performs the necessary maneuvers to enter the space, and can return to the pick-up point. The underlying technology can be either an autonomous driving system or a remote-controlled valet system.\nAt CES 2024, visitors can try out remote-controlled valet parking for themselves. Remote control provides control in situations where fully autonomous systems may face major challenges, such as complex or unknown environments.\nThe remote control uses modern technology and live camera images to navigate and move the vehicle in order to park and return in a controlled manner. Possible areas of application for this technology in the future could include parking for events, at airports, or in logistics.\nKevin Benavides topped timesheets at grueling third stage of 2024 Dakar Rally\nStarting week two of 2024 Africa Eco Race in best way possible\nRelated Articles\nBoth Pata Yamahas in the Top Five in Argentina\nThe Pata Yamaha WorldSBK team continued their run of positive form in today\u2019s Race 1 in Argentina, with Michael van der Mark finishing in fourth place and teammate Alex Lowes following him across the line [\u2026]\nBMW Group Classic at R\u00e9tromobile 2019 in Paris\nMunich/Paris.

Informa PLC's registered office is 5 Howick Place, London SW1P 1WG. Registered in England and Wales. Number 8860726.\nBMW Reveals Innovations at CES 2024\nGreg Kable | Jan 08, 2024\nLAS VEGAS \u2013 BMW showcases several innovations earmarked for future production models at CES 2024 here.\nIncluded are new digital infotainment functions as well as developments centering on BMW\u2019s existing voice assistant and remote parking systems.\nAmong the digital advances is integrating gaming controllers with BMW\u2019s latest 9.0 operating system. An extension of BMW\u2019s gaming offerings, it allows single- and multi-player games via the AirConsole App.\nBMW says the new Bluetooth controller integration (pictured, below) will be rolled out to selected production models in 2024, with customers able to choose from a selection of games via the BMW ConnectedDrive Store.\nAdditionally, BMW reveals the latest changes to its Video App, which now allows digital content to be streamed on the central display in models with either the BMW 8.5 or 9.0 operating systems via a further developed TiVo App.\nDeveloped in partnership with XPERI, the optimization of the TiVo App permits streaming of live TV channels as well as on-demand media libraries via a new DTS AutoStage video service. Initially launched on the eighth-generation 5-Series, BMW says it will be rolled out to other new models, including second-generation X2 and new Mini models, in 2024.\nThe BMW Video App is currently available in eight markets, including North America.\nA further innovation being showcased is BMW\u2019s wearable augmented reality technology, streamed through new XReal Air2 glasses. Developed in partnership with Meta Reality Labs and XREAL, it allows more comprehensive visualizations, including navigation, hazard, entertainment content, charging stations and parking assist functions, via the 3D glasses.\nBMW says the new glasses provide a more stable visualization of content than earlier incarnations of the XREAL Air. A more seamless connection to the sensor data of the car is also claimed to provide more precise pinpointing of visualizations.\nAnother development is an updated version of its Voice Assistant that operates in combination with Amazon\u2019s Alexa Large Language Model (LLM). Earmarked for future production models, it brings additional artificial intelligence functionality to BMW\u2019s Intelligent Personal Assistant, providing faster and more seamless processing of conversational commands and questions, according to the German automaker.\nBMW is yet to confirm when its LLM-supported Voice Assistant will be made available, though it says the existing system, which works with limited AI functionality, will be improved on models running BMW\u2019s 9.0 operating system in 2024.\nThe final development shown by BMW is its latest Level 4 autonomous driving technology. Developed in partnership with Valeo, it includes an automated valet parking function (pictured, below) that allows the driver to leave the car at a defined drop-off point. From this point onward, the car autonomously searches for an empty parking space and parks itself. BMW says the car also can return to the drop-off point autonomously when prompted by the driver via a smartphone.\nMore information about text formats\nComments\nPlain text\nFollow us:"

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too.

Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024.

And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels.

In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

        "raw_content": "The Best Car And Technology Reveals From CES 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show is more important than ever in the automotive realm.\nCES 2024 has just wrapped up in Las Vegas with a strong showing from automakers and automotive-related tech companies. More than just concepts, these displays preview what will soon be a reality in the cars we drive, which is why we've selected 10 technologies and vehicles revealed at this year's event that will impact the automotive realm.\nOnce again, manufacturers and suppliers brought their A-game. These are our favorite car and technology reveals from CES 2024. We didn't pick these randomly, either; all of these represent technology that will reach the mainstream sooner than you know.\nWhat Is CES And Why Does Matter?\nAutomotive manufacturers and technology producers used to stick to their own lanes, but the line between the two is becoming increasingly blurry. That's why the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has become a popular platform for automakers and suppliers to showcase new automotive technology, and CES 2024 was a hotbed for automotive innovation.\nA decade ago, the most advanced piece of technology in a car was the infotainment system, but we now live in the era of permanently connected vehicles. And let's not forget about electric cars, which run on platforms that have allowed engineers and designers to explore and push through existing automotive boundaries.\n1. Facial Recognition\nContinental Automotive showcased its new Face Authentication Display, which uses biometric recognition to identify the owner and anyone authorized to use whatever car. There are cameras mounted in the B-pillar and instrument cluster. You walk up, and the car recognizes you, unlocks, and activates. And before you ask, the answer is no. You can't access the vehicle using a photograph or mask.\nThe humble car key was good enough for a hundred years, but Mercedes-Benz changed the game when it introduced the W220 S-Class Sedan in 1999. It was the first car equipped with a key that sent out a unique frequency, which unlocked the vehicle as the driver. Nowadays, it's a common piece of tech, and automakers constantly try to outdo each other with new smartphone-based key technology.\nFacial recognition is already widely used in the smartphone industry, and it's only a matter of time before it filters down into cars. This tech could also help detect inebriation, preventing you from driving drunk.\n2. Hyundai Mobis Mobion\nThe Mobion is a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with unique bumpers and lights, but that's not why it's here. It's here because it showcases what's possible when you mount an electric motor within each of the four wheels. Since the wheels are self-contained units, they can rotate individually within the wheel well.\nHyundai Mobis (the automaker's technology arm) used the Mobion to demonstrate Pivot Turn, Diagonal Drive, Zero Turn, and Reverse Drive. It's the most agile car we've ever seen in action, and a system like this will make parking in congested cities like Los Angeles a joy.\n3. BMW's Augmented Reality Glasses\nBMW brought many of its latest gadgets to CES, but the one that stood out was the wearable XREAL Air 2 augmented reality glasses.\nInstead of projecting information on a head-up display, these glasses will force the real and digital realms to unite fantastically. You put them on, and you'll see navigation and hazard information, points of interest, and even entertainment content. The theory is that the world around you can be presented in a new light, and we imagine rod closures, accidents, and even things like potholes can be made visible long before you arrive on the scene. Plus, points of interest like restaurants can be highlighted, and we'd imagine the tech can be extended to allow passengers (particularly children) to play games by interacting with the world around them.\n4. Harman Ready Vision QVUE & AR HUD\nHarman came to CES prepared with several creations OEMs will be studying carefully in the coming months. We're big fans of Ready Vision QVUE and the innovative head-up display. The scalable technology can be easily applied to affordable EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox and high-end luxury barges like the Cadillac Escalade IQ, as the technology can utilize a small area or become a full-width HUD.\nReady Vision projects valuable information on the lower part of the windscreen, and it can utilize augmented reality to project navigation over the road in front of you to enhance the HUD experience. Owners can also install third-party apps from the Harman Ignite Store, adding to the information on display with things like charge states, 3D navigation, and real-time traffic, and you could even order take-out.\n5. VinFast VF 3\nVinFast got off to a rocky start in the USA, but that didn't stop the automaker from introducing the VF 3 at CES.\nWe didn't get many details about the tiny electric SUV, but VinFast provided the most important number: a projected starting price of under $20,000. VinFast is also setting up shop in the USA, which means the VF 3 could potentially qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit.\nApply that, and you get a starting price of $12,500. The estimated range may only be 125 miles, but that low price will be mighty attractive to people who don't travel long distances.\nIf a tiny crossover isn't your thing, the Vietnamese brand also revealed a pickup truck concept called the VF Wild, inspired by superhero costumes.\n6. Kia Platform Beyond Vehicle Solutions\nKia introduced five concept vehicles at CES 2024, showcasing the future of electric commercial vehicles. The PV1, PV5, and PV7 were all designed to be robust, modular, and clever tools. They're boxy by design and boast a weldless body structure that can accommodate interchangeable upper bodies.\nWe'll use the PV5 as an example. During the day, it can be used as a last-mile delivery vehicle. After its shift is done, the owner can put the minivan-like body on top and send it out to serve as a taxi.\n7. Mercedes-Benz And Amazon Music\nMercedes-Benz announced a collaboration with Audible and Amazon Music. The new E-Class and CLE will be the first models to benefit from this partnership, and both features will be rolled out in Q3 this year.\nWhy does this matter? If you're an audiophile, you'll know that Amazon Music with Dolby Atmos was introduced last year. Basically, the sound quality is so good that you feel immersed in it rather than listening to it. In reality, you'll be stuck in traffic but feel like you're in the golden circle at a Pearl Jam concert.\nThis was just one of several pieces of tech the German automaker brought, including a new AI virtual assistant bound for the new CLA-Class and a collaboration with will.i.am that creates music based on your driving inputs.\n8. Volkswagen Golf GTI And ChatGPT\nVolkswagen announced that it will implement ChatGPT into its upcoming infotainment systems, starting with the Mk8.5 Golf GTI, making the voice assistant more powerful. Cerence Chat Pro will back VW's system and will be capable of so much more than turning the temperature up by a few degrees.\nAccording to VW, this will benefit all occupants. You can answer the car questions or converse with it when alone.\nWe're on the fence about this one. On the one hand, having a Golf GTI as a friend would be cool. Conversely, we've seen Her and how prone people are to fall in love with an AI system. Plus, our social battery gets depleted from interacting with people and recharged by driving, so why would we want to detract from our happy place by being forced to converse with it to get basic functions done?\n9. Lamborghini Digital Driver Coach\nWhen it comes to supercars, there's one universal truth. Driving talent doesn't increase in correlation with the size of your wallet. In short, you may have $500,000 to splurge on a Lamborghini Revuelto, but that doesn't mean you have the talent to exploit its capabilities.\nThat's what Lamborghini wants to fix with Telemetry X. This system can send recordings of on-track performance and telemetry to a driving coach who will provide live feedback. It won't make you a Formula 1 ace, but you'll be able to get the most out of the Revuelto's 1,000 horses. It can also tap into your biometrics to provide enhanced coaching, and the virtual assistant will give you feedback as you drive, telling you if you're faster or slower of if your brakes are overheating. It's like having your own version of Gianpiero Lambiase in the car with you.\n10. Zeekr 007\nThe owners of the James Bond IP probably won't allow the Zeekr 007 to go into production sporting that name, but that's not important right now. The fact that Zeekr chose the Las Vegas-based CES to showcase one of its models is a grand statement of intent. The 007 isn't new (it was revealed at the end of December 2023), but this surely means Zeekr wants to become the first Chinese manufacturer to do business in the USA.\nThe Chinese-spec model has a dual-motor setup that produces 636 horsepower and a range of 540 miles. Is that enough to get people out of their Teslas? How will the market respond to a Chinese-built vehicle, especially since the government has made no secret that it does not want China to send its product here?"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best EV and car tech of CES 2024: from Honda, BMW, Mercedes and more\nCES 2024 was big for EV and automative innovation\nCars are rapidly becoming an extension of our digital lives \u2013\u00a0and this week's CES 2024 showed how much the two will continue to intertwine this year and beyond.\nWhether it's accessing your calendar on the move or controlling your smart home kit with your voice, cars are increasingly becoming giant smartphones. Add a push towards alternative fuel sources, be it electricity or hydrogen, into the mix, and you can see why the Consumer Electronics Show is becoming a favorite spot for automakers to reveal their latest innovations.\nThis year saw just a handful of new vehicle concepts unveiled, chiefly Honda\u2019s re-writing of its own EV rulebook and Kia\u2019s push into commercial vehicles. But AI assistants and advanced infotainment offerings were arguably the show\u2019s core theme in 2024.\nLuckily for you, we sweatily shuffled over 40km in three days to get hands-on with the most important EV and in-car tech reveals of CES 2024...\n1. Honda resets the EV clock to zero\nHonda's journey towards electrification hasn't exactly been smooth sailing. But at CES 2024, the Japanese company said it wants to remedy that by going back to \"the starting point of Honda as an automaker\". Essentially, it is ripping up its own rulebook and starting afresh.\nThe result is two stunning concepts, the 0 Series Saloon and Space-hub, both offering a glimpse at Honda\u2019s overarching design direction and EV philosophy.\nGlobal CEO Toshihiro Mibe says his company wants to move away from the \"thick and heavy\" electric cars of today and instead focus on a \"thin, light and wise\" philosophy.\nCut through the non-speak and Honda is looking towards the next generation of thinner and lighter battery packs to power its sleek, low and rakish Saloon, which is tipped to be very close to a production version and is promised to inherit the marque\u2019s 'joy of driving' spirit.\nThere\u2019s no word on range and performance, as it\u2019s likely still hypothetical, but both the Saloon and the people moving, lounge-like Space-Hub will both feature advanced driver assist systems, high levels of autonomous driving capabilities and, fingers crossed, some cutting-edge infotainment thanks to Honda\u2019s close ties with multimedia and entertainment giant Sony.\n2. BMW showcases AR driving\nBMW hosted demos of an Xreal Air 2-based augmented reality experience aboard a BMW iX at CES 2024 \u2013\u00a0and TechRadar\u2019s US Editor-in-Chief Lance Ulanoff said that what he saw \"surprised and often delighted\" him.\nThat\u2019s high praise indeed, but rather than merely being a fun gimmick (BMW made it rain AR casino betting chips on our cruise around Las Vegas), it could also be a very handy extension of the navigation and infotainment system in general.\nWith the Xreal Air 2 glasses on, BMW is able to project driver information onto the real world outside the windscreen, with strobing 3D green arrows highlighting upcoming turns, and large red blocks warning when the driver is getting dangerously close to static objects.\nCurrently, the system is running through a smartphone that is connected to the car, but developers behind the tech want to make the entire experience wireless, opening it up to other brands of augmented reality glasses to make the experience as seamless as possible for potential customers.\nBut the ultimate party piece? Flip down the front sun visor and the system becomes an impressively sharp\u00a0private cinema. Perfect for whiling away the hours when charging modern EVs on a cripplingly slow public charging network.\n3. Kia pushes into electric vans\nKia's interpretation of PBV stands for \u2018Platform Beyond Vehicles\u2019, rather than the more commonly used 'purpose built vehicles', but either way this is its break into the electric commercial vehicle market.\nThe upcoming line-up comprises the PV1, PV5 and PV7, which showcase a range of sizes and applications, and span ideas that are very close to production, as well as those that are little more future-thinking.\nThe mid-sized PV5 is our best indication of what Kia\u2019s electric van will look like and its highly modular interior can be configured for a range of scenarios, be it last mile delivery or transporting the family in a ride-hailing service.\nOne of its key USPs is its software defined nature, which allows it to pass data from a central control room to the vehicle and vice versa, making it simple for operators to manage an entire fleet in real time, without the need for additional technology.\nAs we look into the future-gazing crystal ball, we will see fully autonomous versions and what Kia is calling 'Easy Swap' technology, which allows a single vehicle chassis to house multiple upper bodies, effectively transforming it from a cargo carrier to mobile office (and beyond) in minutes thanks to hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling tech.\n4. Mercedes reinvents your driving playlist\nIt was the CES innovation I really wanted to hate, but ended up becoming slightly smitten with, as Mercedes-Benz effectively turned its electric vehicles into musical instruments.\nThanks to Will.i.am and his team of talented developers, the Mercedes-Benz MBUX Sound Drive app deconstructs your favourite tracks and uses information from the vehicle, such as steering inputs, acceleration and braking, to create intriguing, live performance style remixes.\nYou can read our full hands-on MBUX experience for more details, but a quick test of the technology proved it was less a gimmicky way to kill a few minutes, and more a clever way to uniquely soundtrack an audibly-bereft electric vehicle. Hey, I don\u2019t even like The Black Eyed Peas, but MBUX Sound Drive made me reconsider my position.\n5. Harman turns car seats into speakers\nDubbed SeatSonic, Harman\u2019s passenger-centric audio system completely rethinks the in-car listening experience, with one Harman executive going so far as saying it also \"frees car designers from today\u2019s interior constraints\".\nWe\u2019re not sure how much design real estate is actually behind a door card, but the idea is solid, as it sees near-field transducers integrated into the headrests and a proprietary bass unit in the lumbar section of the seats for a viscerally bassy experience.\nThe sound quality is great, although the basic package, where speakers are only installed in the seats, can sound a little dull and distant. To combat this, Harman will offer additional tweeters that nestle beneath the windscreen for a much richer listen.\nBetter still, Harman says that because the audio doesn\u2019t have to travel as far, there is a 60 per cent power saving when compared to a conventional in-car audio set-up. That stuff makes a big difference in today\u2019s world of electric vehicles and range anxiety.\nHarman has been working with seat makers, as well as Tier 1 suppliers that produce automotive grade ventilation, heating and massaging tech, to integrate it into one neat, ready to rock package. So expect to see it go live soon.\n6. Mobion banishes awkward parking situations\nStick with us here, as this one gets a little weird. But Hyundai Mobis, a subsidiary of automotive giant Hyundai, offered a glimpse of a future where tricky parking situations are no more. The Mobion concept car, which is just a jazzy Hyundai Ioniq 5, features the company\u2019s In-Wheel motor technology and upcoming e-Corner drive system.\nHere, all four wheels are driven and can steer independently of one another. Motors in the wheels mean no axles, which frees up each corner to do as it pleases. Well, within reason.\nA live demonstration showed how Mobion can \u2018crab-walk\u2019, where all four wheels rotate 90-degrees and the car effectively performs a sideways scuttle into tough parallel parking spots. The system can move the car diagonally, back and forth, as well as see it rotate a full 360 degrees around its centre axis \u2013 it puts our U-turns to shame.\nNaturally, everything is overseen by Lidar, radar and high-definition cameras, which allows most manoeuvers to be performed autonomously, while exterior projection lighting allows the car to project safety information around it as it performs its party tricks \u2013 seemingly so pedestrians don\u2019t completely freak out.\nThe In-Wheel motor and e-Corner system are \"ready for immediate mass production,\" according to Vice President Lee Seung-Hwan, the Head of Advanced Engineering at Hyundai Mobis. The company just needs to find a suitable Hyundai or Kia product to place it in.\n7. Mullen goes supersonic with its 1,000bhp Five RS\nCalifornian EV maker Mullen took the wraps off potentially one of the most aggressive and utterly banzai electric SUVs were have ever laid eyes on. The performance figures hurt just to look at: 1,000bhp, 0-60mph in under two seconds and a top speed in excess of 200mph.\nAll that, and Mullen says it will feature a two-speed transmission, an 800V electrical architecture for faster charging and offer over 300 miles of real-world range. Race-derived Brembo braking products, bucket seats, and an overtly aggressive stance all come as standard.\nBut because this is a modern EV, it also features an enormous dual screen infotainment set-up that is reported to come complete with a built-in voice assistant.\nAccording to Car and Driver, the Five RS is slated to go on sale in Europe in 2025, with a US version following in 2027. Prices are due to start at an eye-watering $295,000 / \u00a3231,000 / \u20ac268,000 / AUS$441,000.\n8. Hyundai takes to the skies\nIn a purpose-built 'vertiport' outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center sat Hyundai\u2019s Supernal S-A2, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) craft that is set to begin testing next year. Designed by Hyundai\u2019s Luc Donckerwolke, the man behind the stunning N Vision 74 (and many others), it takes styling inspiration from the eyes of a bee and features a highly configurable, premium interior that can seat up to four passengers.\nUsing eight tilting rotors, it can fly at speeds of up to 120mph, while the on-board high density battery packs are good for trips ranging from 25 to 40 miles \u2013 although that will increase. The idea is that the craft operates at 1,500ft, way below commercial aircraft, and offers short hops between inner city \u2018vertiports\u2019 using an Uber-style ride hailing platform.\nHead of the project and ex-NASA man Jaiwon Shin, says quietness is key, stating that the S-A2 emits just 65db during take-off and around 45db during cruise, which he says his less than a domestic dishwasher. He wants to avoid people \"looking up\" when it is in operation and hopes it will \"blend into inner-city traffic noise\".\nThe eVTOL craft has 'upgrade-ability' baked into it, meaning the S-A2 is ready to accept the next generation of battery technology. Supernal says it is moving beyond an early technology demonstrator and will begin testing the S-A2 you see before you in 2025.\n9. XPeng reveals pre-order plan for its AeroHT Land Aircraft Carrier\nIf XPeng is the Chinese manufacturer of impressive and altogether highly competitive electric cars, XPeng AeroHT is its slightly bonkers, future-thinking little brother. A sibling that comes up with flying car concepts and six-wheeled off-road MPVs that come complete with a human piloted electric 'Air Module' in the back.\n\"I like flying, I have a helicopter, but I can\u2019t take the helicopter where I want. If I have this car, I can drive to where I want, park up and go flying,\" XPeng AeroHT\u2019s co-founder and vice president, Tan Wang told me at CES this year. \"The car is for customers that like to go off-road, but the performance on the road is way better, because it has three motors, one on each axle\" he added.\nIn addition to this, Wang claims the Air Module is much simpler to operate than a standard helicopter, as it blends human piloting skills with advanced levels of autonomy. Because of this, Wang feels it will require much fewer than 40 flying hours to obtain a helicopter license to legally be able to operate the eVTOL craft.\nWang also went on record to say the company was accepting pre-orders as of the end of this year, and that he hoped to have product in the air by the end of 2025. Both the six-wheeled vehicle and the aircraft can be yours for $200,000 /\u00a3157,000 /\u20ac182,000 / AUS$298,000, which feels like a bit of a bargain to us.\nHowever, Wang also pointed out that his company was \"still in the process\" of obtaining certification from the Chinese Aviation Authority, but he was hopeful it would happen soon.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest\u00a0CES news\u00a0from the show as it happens.
