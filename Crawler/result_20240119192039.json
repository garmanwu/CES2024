The pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle marks the latest milestone in Supernal\u2019s roadmap to commercialize safe, efficient and affordable everyday passenger air travel.\nS-A2 builds on the Company\u2019s vision concept, S-A1, which it debuted at CES 2020, bringing together the innovative aerospace engineering and Hyundai Motor Group automotive aesthetic design to create a new mode of transportation to get people in urban areas from point A to point B faster. Supernal will achieve commercial aviation safety levels and enable affordable manufacturing of its vehicles as it prepares to enter the market in 2028.\n\u201cFrom the beginning, Supernal has been on a mission to create the right product and the right market at the right time,\u201d said Jaiwon Shin, president of Hyundai Motor Group and CEO of Supernal. \u201cThe unveiling of S-A2 demonstrates our unwavering commitment to deliver on that mission with a safe, efficient vehicle design that provides a clear path to market entry. By leveraging our talented 600-person team, the vast technical and business capabilities of Hyundai Motor Group and trusted aviation suppliers around the world, Supernal is ready to deliver a new era of flight.\u201d\nTechnical ComponentsS-A2 is a V-tail aircraft designed to cruise 120 miles-per-hour at a 1,500-foot altitude to meet typical city operation needs of 25- to 40-mile trips, initially. It features a distributed electric propulsion architecture and has eight all-tilting rotors. At entry into service, Supernal\u2019s vehicle will operate as quietly as a dishwasher: 65 dB in vertical take-off and landing phases and 45 dB while cruising horizontally.\nThe vehicle is designed with a priority on safety and a focus on sustainability and passenger comfort. Engineered to achieve the global commercial aviation standard of safety, it has a robust airframe structure including redundant components in critical systems such as powertrain, flight controls and avionics. The all-tilting rotor configuration will power the vehicle through both the vertical-lift and horizontal-cruise phases of flight with unique efficiency. To maintain superior quality while also being cost-effective, the vehicle will be manufactured leveraging Hyundai\u2019s mass production capability.\n\u201cSupernal\u2019s product concept vehicle is the result of the creativity and hard work of our world-class team. S-A2 is designed to take full advantage of emerging electric powertrain advancements that will define the next generation of aviation,\u201d said Ben Diachun, chief technology officer, Supernal. \u201cFrom here, we will develop this concept into a revolutionary commercial product.\u201d\nAs Supernal continues to optimize its vehicle for certification, mass production and expanded use cases, the Company is also focused on interior modularity and battery upgradability. This includes the ability to replace the battery module as technology advances.\nAesthetic DesignSupernal\u2019s engineering teams partnered with Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s automotive designers on S-A2\u2019s aesthetics \u2013 blending design with functionality \u2013 that will attract aviation operators and create the preferred AAM passenger experience. Different color palettes and materials delineate distinct pilot and passenger sections of the vehicle. Aviation-grade, energy-absorbing components are integrated into the seat frames, and contribute to the overall clean, minimalist design. Lighting transitions throughout phases of flight allow the cabin to feel larger and to provide visual cues, such as where to enter and exit the vehicle.\n\u201cS-A2 is a true representation of \u2018auto meets aero.\u2019 Drawing on the competence of Supernal\u2019s top aerospace engineers and Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s world-renowned automotive designers to create human-centric design that maximizes passenger experience and safety,\u201d said Luc Donckerwolke, president, chief design officer and chief creative officer, Hyundai Motor Group.\nDrawing on experience from designing \u201csmart cars\u201d with similar efficient footprints and recent award-winning electric vehicles, Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s designers also incorporated the latest in passenger experience and automotive design best-practices into S-A2.\nSupernal at CES 2024S-A2 is on display within the Supernal Vertiport exhibition at CES 2024, located in the Diamond parking lot next to the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center. The future \u201ctransportation hub\u201d brings together Supernal\u2019s holistic vision for AAM, placing S-A2 in an operational setting. Attendees have the opportunity \u2013 under one roof \u2013 to see the vehicle product concept, take a simulated flight above the city of Los Angeles, learn about potential flight networks and the technology to support them, as well as understand how vertiports and other transportation modes will create quicker and easier metropolitan journeys.\nVertiports represent a key element for AAM commercialization, serving as the origin, transfer and destination points for eVTOL aircraft operations and existing modes of transportation. Quiet electric flight will enable vertiports to be in cities, at airports and elsewhere for seamless integration with existing transit options. Combined with air traffic control improvements and advanced micro-weather forecasting, S-A2 and vertiports will facilitate mobility far beyond what existing and projected ground infrastructure can deliver.\nClick here for more information about Supernal\u2019s CES 2024 exhibition and S-A2 visuals.\n###\nAbout SupernalSupernal (Su\u00b7per\u00b7nal) is an Advanced Air Mobility company that\u2019s developing an electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) vehicle and the ground-to-air ecosystem to support the emerging industry.

The pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle marks the latest milestone in Supernal's roadmap to commercialize safe, efficient and affordable everyday passenger air travel.\nS-A2 builds on the Company's vision concept, S-A1, which it debuted at CES 2020, bringing together the innovative aerospace engineering and Hyundai Motor Group automotive aesthetic design to create a new mode of transportation to get people in urban areas from point A to point B faster. Supernal will achieve commercial aviation safety levels and enable affordable manufacturing of its vehicles as it prepares to enter the market in 2028.\n\"From the beginning, Supernal has been on a mission to create the right product and the right market at the right time,\" said Jaiwon Shin, president of Hyundai Motor Group and CEO of Supernal. \"The unveiling of S-A2 demonstrates our unwavering commitment to deliver on that mission with a safe, efficient vehicle design that provides a clear path to market entry. By leveraging our talented 600-person team, the vast technical and business capabilities of Hyundai Motor Group and trusted aviation suppliers around the world, Supernal is ready to deliver a new era of flight.\"\nTechnical ComponentsS-A2 is a V-tail aircraft designed to cruise 120 miles-per-hour at a 1,500-foot altitude to meet typical city operation needs of 25- to 40-mile trips, initially. It features a distributed electric propulsion architecture and has eight all-tilting rotors. At entry into service, Supernal's vehicle will operate as quietly as a dishwasher: 65 dB in vertical take-off and landing phases and 45 dB while cruising horizontally.\nThe vehicle is designed with a priority on safety and a focus on sustainability and passenger comfort. Engineered to achieve the global commercial aviation standard of safety, it has a robust airframe structure including redundant components in critical systems such as powertrain, flight controls and avionics. The all-tilting rotor configuration will power the vehicle through both the vertical-lift and horizontal-cruise phases of flight with unique efficiency. To maintain superior quality while also being cost-effective, the vehicle will be manufactured leveraging Hyundai's mass production capability.\n\"Supernal's product concept vehicle is the result of the creativity and hard work of our world-class team.

Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\nShare this story\nThe last time Hyundai brought an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) prototype to CES, it was 2020, and the South Korean automaker was talking bullishly about adding it to Uber\u2019s forthcoming air taxi network.\nToday, Uber\u2019s air taxi network has been sold to another startup, the air taxi industry as a whole is still struggling to get a commercial service up and running, and Hyundai is unveiling a new \u201cproduct concept\u201d that it says will be ready for production by 2028.\nSupernal, the automaker\u2019s eVTOL division, says its S-A2 concept can cruise at 120mph and reach an altitude of 1,500 feet. It packs enough battery capacity for the type of 25- to 40-mile trips that helicopters commonly conduct between downtowns and airports for wealthy business types.\nSupernal says its S-A2 concept can cruise at 120mph and reach an altitude of 1,500 feet\nThe company says its aircraft will \u201coperate as quietly as a dishwasher,\u201d emitting 65 decibels in vertical takeoff and landing phases and 45dB while cruising horizontally. By comparison, the average helicopter puts out between 96 and 107db. Next to eliminating pollution, noise reduction is the most common argument in favor of electric aircraft.\nWith eight tilt rotors and an egg-shaped cabin, Supernal\u2019s concept looks similar to other air taxi prototypes we\u2019ve seen, including those from Joby Aviation, Wisk Aero, and Archer Aviation.\nSupernal is one of a handful of companies that wants to replace noisy, polluting helicopters and regional aircraft with all-electric, multi-rotor vehicles designed for short hops between nearby airports or quick trips from an urban downtown to a local airport.\nInitially, these aircraft were\u00a0mislabeled as \u201cflying cars\u201d\u00a0based on their ability to take off and land vertically like a helicopter and then shift to forward flight through the use of electric-powered tilt rotors. Early on,\u00a0companies embraced the \u201cflying car\u201d label, seeking to capitalize on the retro-futuristic appeal that harkens back to old\u00a0Popular Science\u00a0and\u00a0Popular Mechanics\u00a0covers and engineering eccentricities like\u00a0the \u201cMoller Skycar.\u201d\nBut as they slowly plod through endless testing procedures mandated by a lengthy regulatory process, they have since rallied around new nomenclature, like eVTOL, urban air mobility, advanced air mobility, and air taxis.\nThere\u2019s been plenty of turbulence in this emerging industry. A number of startups have gone out of business, most notably,\u00a0Google founder Larry Page\u2019s Kitty Hawk, which helped kick off the boom in 2017. There have been\u00a0lawsuits,\u00a0layoffs,\u00a0mergers, and no shortage of drama, including\u00a0a handful of fires\u00a0and at least\u00a0one (uncrewed) crash.\nSupernal\u2019s ties to Hyundai could give it an advantage in the manufacturing of its aircraft, as the spinoff will be able to rely on the automaker\u2019s mass production capabilities to help it get started. But the company won\u2019t have any special advantages when it comes to regulatory approval, which promises to be long and difficult.\n1/7\n1/7\nUnder FAA rules, aviation companies need to receive three types of certification before launching a commercial service in the US: type certification means the aircraft meets all of the FAA\u2019s design and safety standards; production certification is the approval to begin manufacturing the aircraft; and air carrier certification means the company can officially conduct commercial air taxi services.\nSupernal says it\u2019s putting a lot of focus on batteries, particularly, the ability to upgrade to lighter cells when the technology improves. One of the main challenges with electric flight is the power-to-weight ratio. Heavy batteries create more weight, requiring more power to compensate, and even bigger batteries. That\u2019s why Supernal and others are focused on short flights and regional hops.\nSupernal says it\u2019s putting a lot of focus on batteries\nBut Supernal isn\u2019t so daunted by the technological challenges that it can\u2019t picture a cozy interior with fine leather upholstery. The design is clean and minimal, with lighting meant to give the impression of being in a larger space.\nHyundai isn\u2019t the only global company to see visions of small electric aircraft buzzing over cities.

        "raw_content": "ABC News\nVideo\nLive\nShows\nElection 2024\n538\nStream on\nEdmunds highlights top car-tech trends from CES 2024\nCES in Las Vegas gives us a glimpse of where automakers believe vehicles are headed in the future\nCES provides an annual insight into where and how cutting-edge innovations will reshape how people work, study, communicate and, in many cases, how they\u2019ll drive. This year CES saw a number of automakers present concept vehicles that seem both years into the future and on the very cusp of production.\nFrom flying vehicles and AI-powered voice assistants to the latest in EVs, CES 2024 offers a peek into what you\u2019ll be driving \u2014 or what might be driving you \u2014 in the years ahead. The automotive experts at Edmunds have rounded up some of this year\u2019s most notable automotive debuts.\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is poised to reshape countless aspects of daily life. While there are plenty of concerns and opportunities involved, it\u2019s clear that automakers will be moving ahead to use AI for what they hope will be a more helpful and optimistic driving future.\nMercedes-Benz, for its part, debuted its next-generation AI virtual assistant software. The upcoming version of Mercedes\u2019 MBUX infotainment interface, dubbed MB.OS, will feature conversational voice commands and far more nuanced responses. For example, by monitoring voice instructions and driving behavior, the AI system can determine if a driver is hurried and stressed or cruising along carefree. A version of MB.OS is set to debut in Mercedes\u2019 upcoming electric-powered CLA sedan.\nAnother German automaker, Volkswagen, says it will integrate ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot, into its vehicles to provide more voice interaction beyond what\u2019s currently available. For example, the car\u2019s existing voice command features will work for things like navigation, climate control or general knowledge requests. But something it can\u2019t handle will be forwarded anonymously to ChatGPT. ChatGPT will then respond in a seamless Volkswagen voice and style. For now, Volkswagen has not said when this functionality will be available on its vehicles sold in the United States.\nReliable, efficient and out-of-this-world wild. Which one of these descriptors is not often attributed to the practically minded Honda Motor Co.? In the near future, all of them look to apply to Honda\u2019s upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, dubbed the 0 Series. Taking design cues from seemingly everything from a ground-hugging sports car to a 1980s-era Dustbuster vacuum cleaner, the Honda Saloon concept vehicle is a hint at the Japanese automaker\u2019s EV strategy and upcoming designs.\nWith its wedge-shaped body, truncated tail and upward-swinging doors, the Honda Saloon is a head-turning sedan that hints at a production model due in 2026. It will also debut the latest in EV technology, such as a more efficient and longer-lasting battery pack. Just don\u2019t expect that the Saloon\u2019s glowing front grille, gullwing doors and yoke-style steering wheel are all part of the finished product.\nFlying cars seem like something straight out of a science fiction movie, yet they were very much in the here and now at CES 2024. One of the most head-turning is the eVTOL Flying Car created by Chinese automaker XPeng. Equal parts low-lying supercar and high-flying helicopter, this wedge-shaped concept is wildly futuristic and entirely electric powered.\nNotably, the company\u2019s concept isn\u2019t a flying car in the traditional sense. It doesn\u2019t have wings and uses its electrically powered fans to produce lift and fly straight up. It can theoretically take off and land anywhere there\u2019s room, making travel as a sort of gridlock-avoiding city vehicle more likely.\nAnother electric helicopter-like entry at the show was the Supernal S-A2. Supernal is notable for being an offshoot of Hyundai. The connection to the giant South Korean automaker certainly adds some plausibility to the S-A2 turning into reality. The S-A2\u2019s specs aren\u2019t mind-boggling, with a maximum range of just 25-40 miles, but that might be all you need for an aerial taxi.\nSupernal says it hopes the S-A2 will be a production reality by 2028. Still, don\u2019t get your hopes up too much that your daily commute is about to take flight. Wait-and-see is the best approach as other vital details such as price and success overcoming regulatory hurdles all remain very much up in the air.\n_______\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nNick Kurczewski is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Twitter and Instagram\nTop Stories\nConcertgoers sue Madonna over show starting late\nLos Angeles Innocence Project takes up case of notorious killer Scott Peterson\nHBCU administrator's death by suicide prompts calls for president's resignation\nKidnapping of California woman that police called a hoax gets new attention with Netflix documentary\n15 students and 1 teacher drown when a boat capsizes in a lake in western India\nABC News Live\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

With its innovative design, safety features, and commitment to affordability, S-A2 has the potential to revolutionize urban air mobility and transform the way we travel.\nWhile Supernal\u2019s S-A2 is undoubtedly a significant achievement, there are still some challenges that need to be addressed before eVTOLs can become a mainstream form of transportation.\nOne of the biggest hurdles is the need for a robust infrastructure of vertiports, or landing and takeoff areas for eVTOLs. These vertiports will need to be located in strategic locations throughout cities, and they will need to be able to support the high volume of traffic that eVTOLs are expected to generate.\nAnother challenge is the need for regulatory oversight. As of now, there are no clear regulations for eVTOLs, and this could slow down the development and deployment of these aircraft. Governments around the world will need to work together to create a comprehensive regulatory framework that ensures the safety and efficiency of eVTOL operations.\nDespite these challenges, the future of eVTOLs is bright. With continued development and investment, these vehicles have the potential to reduce traffic congestion, improve air quality, and provide people with a new and exciting way to get around. Supernal\u2019s S-A2 is a promising step forward, and it is only a matter of time before eVTOLs become a common sight in our skies.\nYou might like these\nVerge TS Ultra: The World\u2019s First Motorcycle with a \u2018Sense of Sight\u2019\nLigne Roset Taps into the Future of Sustainable Luxury with Reishi Biomaterial\nSpice Island To Have A New Luxury Resort With Five New Original-Concept Outlets And 50-Hectare Beachfront Property"

The pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle marks the latest milestone in Supernal\u2019s roadmap to commercialize safe, efficient and affordable everyday passenger air travel.\nS-A2 builds on the Company\u2019s vision concept, S-A1, which it debuted at CES 2020, bringing together the innovative aerospace engineering and Hyundai Motor Group automotive aesthetic design to create a new mode of transportation to get people in urban areas from point A to point B faster. Supernal will achieve commercial aviation safety levels and enable affordable manufacturing of its vehicles as it prepares to enter the market in 2028.\n\u201cFrom the beginning, Supernal has been on a mission to create the right product and the right market at the right time,\u201d said Jaiwon Shin, president of Hyundai Motor Group and CEO of Supernal. \u201cThe unveiling of S-A2 demonstrates our unwavering commitment to deliver on that mission with a safe, efficient vehicle design that provides a clear path to market entry. By leveraging our talented 600-person team, the vast technical and business capabilities of Hyundai Motor Group and trusted aviation suppliers around the world, Supernal is ready to deliver a new era of flight.\u201d\nTechnical Components\nS-A2 is a V-tail aircraft designed to cruise 120 miles-per-hour at a 1,500-foot altitude to meet typical city operation needs of 25- to 40-mile trips, initially. It features a distributed electric propulsion architecture and has eight all-tilting rotors. At entry into service, Supernal\u2019s vehicle will operate as quietly as a dishwasher: 65 dB in vertical take-off and landing phases and 45 dB while cruising horizontally.\nThe vehicle is designed with a priority on safety and a focus on sustainability and passenger comfort. Engineered to achieve the global commercial aviation standard of safety, it has a robust airframe structure including redundant components in critical systems such as powertrain, flight controls and avionics.
