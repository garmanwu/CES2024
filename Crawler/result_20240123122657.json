        "raw_content": "CES 2024: LG's Massive OLED TV Ditches Wires and Incorporates (What Else?) AI\nLG's pre-CES announcements include a slew of new home entertainment products, including the wireless, 97-inch M4 OLED TV, ultra-slim G4 OLED TV, and a tiny, high-contrast portable projector.\nI\u2019ve been PCMag\u2019s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I\u2019ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade. I\u2019m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I\u2019m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don\u2019t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).\nCES 2024 isn't until next week, but LG got a head start today by unveiling a slew of home entertainment displays before the show. The company just announced its newest flagship OLED TVs, joining the LED TVs and projector it revealed last week.\nThe LG Signature OLED M4 sits at the top of the heap, as an OLED TV that can wirelessly display video at up to 4K resolution and 144Hz streamed from its separate Zero Connect box. This concept was first showed off last year in the OLED M3, but the new version bumps up the maximum refresh rate from 120Hz to 144Hz, and is 150% brighter in peak highlights, LG says.\nThe M4 will also be available in a 65-inch model as well as the 77-, 83-, and 97-inch sizes we saw on the M3. This makes the M4 more accessible in size and presumably price. LG hasn't announced pricing for its newest TVs yet, but the 65-inch M4 will likely be much less expensive than the 77-inch M3, which retails for $4,999.\nFor OLEDs, LG also updated its high-end G line from G3 to G4. The G4 is a conventional TV compared with the wireless M4, and features a very slim design with a nearly flush wall-mounting option, and is updated with a 144Hz refresh rate and a brighter panel.\nBoth the G4 and M4 incorporates LG's new Alpha 11 image processor, which LG claims features 70% better graphical performance and 30% faster speed. LG's popular C3 OLED TV is also being updated to the C4, as well as the entry-level B3 to the B4, but these appear to be minor, iterative updates that use the same image processor as the previous models.\nLG showed off its newest projector as well. The CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that can display a 4K picture with, according to LG, a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. Its most interesting aspect is its size: at 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches (HWD) and 3.3 pounds, it's extremely small for a 4K projector, comparable in volume and slightly lighter than Samsung's 1080p FreeStyle projector.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nFor LED TVs, LG has announced updates to several of its QNED lines. Most notable is the the flagship QNED90, which has what the company called Million Gray Scale that can display 20-bit grayscale gradation. Like the name implies, this should mean the QNED90 can show many, many more shades of gray than most other LED TVs and likely all OLED TVs for which grayscale and brightness variation are typically more difficult. The QNED85 doesn't feature Million Gray Scale, but it stands as LG's biggest LED TV with a 98-inch model available.\nPricing and availability for these new displays haven't been announced yet, but we'll be on the floor at CES to check them out in person.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "[CES 2024] A Better Future \u2013 Zone 01. TV\nAt CES 2024, LG Display presents the TV Zone, featuring the company\u2019s large-sized OLED technologies that surpass the limits of OLED picture quality performance. Various large-sized OLED products and the latest evolution of META Technology, \u2018META Technology 2.0\u2019, is showcased to highlight a new era of OLED picture quality.\nA new addition to LG Display\u2019s portfolio of large-sized OLEDs is the 83-inch OLED with META Technology 2.0. Ever since the first mass production of OLED TV displays back in 2013, LG Display has constantly advanced its WOLED technology, unveiling the second-generation EX Technology in 2022 and the third-generation META Technology in 2023.\nThe company\u2019s newest advancement, META Technology 2.0, features 42% higher peak brightness compared to conventional OLED displays. As peak brightness is a crucial component of higher picture quality, META Technology 2.0 offers a vivid viewing experience akin to what the human eye perceives by achieving 3,000-nit peak brightness, the highest level of any large-sized OLED panel today.\nBy building upon its predecessor by evolving the MLA (Micro Lens Array) to MLA+ and transforming META Booster into META Multi Booster, LG Display also added the proprietary Detail Enhancer technology to attain the 3,000-nit peak brightness mark.\nMLA+ utilizes big data analysis to create a pattern of optimized micrometer-scale lenses. These patterns enable the emission of light inside the panel that was previously lost due to internal reflections. With the resulting increased maximum brightness, the META Multi Booster algorithm combines to enhance brightness and color expression. The \u2018Detail Enhancer\u2019, a full-range brightness detail enhancing algorithm, ensures consistent and accurate color representation in both bright and dark scenes. Integrated with OLED \u2018Pixel Dimming\u2019 technology, controlling each of the 33 million pixels individually (based on 8K), it incorporates a new data processing technique for precise control of the image\u2019s unique colors.\nLG Display will prioritize the implementation of META Technology 2.0 in its lineup of large and ultra-large OLED TV panels, including 4K panels 55-, 65-, 77-, and 83-inches, as well as 8K panels in 77- and 88-inches, which are set to go into mass production this year.\nLG Display\u2019s OLED expertise not only embodies exceptional technology but also stands out as products prioritizing user health and environmental friendliness. Committed to delivering an unmatched visual experience that promotes maximum comfort to the viewers\u2019 eyes, LG Display has earned various global certifications on Low Blue Light, Flicker-Free, Discomfort Glare Free, and even Circadian Friendly for its beneficial impact on sleep quality.\nIn terms of eco-friendliness, LG Display\u2019s OLED has achieved the industry\u2019s first Product Carbon Footprint Certification by verifying greenhouse gas emissions throughout the production process. Additionally, by not using a backlight, it avoids the use of components such as hazardous substances, unlike LCDs. LG Display\u2019s reduction in plastic usage exceeds 90%, and the component recycling rate extends over 92.7%, allowing the company to receive the Product Carbon Footprint from TUV Rheinland.\nBy taking a look at the OLED mockup disassembly, users can see how LG Display\u2019s backlight-free OLED significantly cuts down on plastic usage. In contrast to LCDs, which have six plastic layers out of nine, OLEDs consist of just one plastic polarizer. For a 70-inch panel, this means LCDs are comprised of 25% plastic (6kg), while OLEDs are comprised of only 3% plastic (0.6kg). Demonstrating a commitment to environmental sustainability, LG Display consistently strives to create enduring value with minimal environmental impact.\nRelated Posts\nInnovative ideas chosen as semifinalists in 2nd OLEDs Go! design contest\nWill football fever take OLED to new heights?\n[CES 2023] Lifestyle Application \u2013 3.

Transparent\nAt CES 2024, LG Display presents the Transparent OLED Zone, featuring a wide array of its state-of-the-art Transparent OLED displays. As the world\u2019s sole manufacturer of large Transparent OLEDs that first commercialized the 55-inch Transparent OLED in 2019, LG Display has expanded its lineup to include the 77-inch and 30-inch variants, while also enhancing the overall transparency level to 45% and brightness level to a maximum of 600 nits.\nLG Display\u2019s Transparent OLED combines glass-like transparency with sharp image quality, finding versatile applications in various spaces of our daily lives. While conventional displays often create barriers between spaces, Transparent OLED connects spaces, creating new environments or effectively conveying information by integrating with existing spaces. With sizes expanded to 30- and 77-inches, its versatility has significantly increased.\nThe 30-inch HD Transparent OLED presents diverse possibilities in the small to medium-sized display market. It can serve as a monitor in face-to-face settings, such as reception desks, providing necessary information to visitors while employees engage in conversations.\nThe 55-inch FHD Transparent OLED is a multipurpose display suitable for office spaces, serving as a dashboard or video conferencing device. It can also be utilized in various environments like subway windows or museum showcases.\nThe 77-inch UHD Transparent OLED, offering a large and clear 4K screen, is a perfect solution for home use as a home screen or for professional use on glass walls in office meeting rooms, functioning as a digital signage display.\nThese Transparent OLED displays, with their ongoing technological advancements and high adaptability, are already applied in various industries in our daily lives. At CES 2024, LG Display will showcase a luxury retail store setup, demonstrating how Transparent OLED can offer unique solutions in actual retail spaces!\nThe 77-inch Beyond concept, positioned at the entrance of the store, captivates the attention of visitors and showcases the possibilities of large-sized Transparent OLED in a retail setting. With its crystal-clear 4K display, it is ideal for large advertising signage. The vivid and clear visual representation is well-suited for promoting products effectively through runway show videos, such as moving and walking displays, seamlessly integrating with the store\u2019s interior design.\nThe 55-inch Layered Shelf concept demonstrates the integration of Transparent OLED and regular OLED panels to form a shelf-like structure. This setup allows the conveyance of promotional content in a unique and immersive manner while providing consumers with detailed product information and scenes that convey the stories of the brand and its products.\nAs visitors enter the store, the 30-inch Contact, a transparent kiosk concept designed for openness and harmony with the store interior, replaces traditional kiosks. The vertical arrangement of the 30-inch Transparent OLED, coupled with Add-on touch technology, transforms the kiosk into an interactive platform. Visitors can explore store information, and product details, and even make purchases by viewing the store\u2019s offerings, wish list, and more.\nThe 30-inch Half & Half showcase concept combines the 30-inch Transparent OLED with anti-reflective glass to further accentuate the displayed product, while the printing panel located in the back of the showcase illustrates three-dimensional promotion images with detailed information about the product.\nThe 30-inch Transparent Access concept is easily applicable on shelves within the store and features a Transparent OLED placed in front of products. This design allows for an overlay effect, emphasizing the displayed products. Alternatively, placing the Transparent OLED behind products enhances the aesthetic value of the store\u2019s interior, providing a stylish and elevated presentation.\nThe 30-inch T-Float concept is a vertical podium concept of the 30-inch Transparent OLED and can be utilized to capture the attention of consumers from afar by portraying content or promoting family line products that complement the displayed items while maximizing the value of products through spatial highlights. This product goes beyond harmonizing with the store environment, aiming to maximize the value of products through creating spatial highlights.\nRelated Posts\nLG Display Leads the Way in Automotive Displays for \u2018Smartphone on Wheels\u2019\nInnovative ideas chosen as semifinalists in 2nd OLEDs Go! design contest\nBright Screens that Go Easy on Your Eyes!

Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nPeak Chic: Balenciaga's $5,600 Snowboard Leads a Flurry of Luxury Skiwear and Accessories\nCara Delevingne, South Korean Model Xu Meen Make a Case for Digital Nomad Style in MCM's New Campaign\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office. It\u2019s expected to launch on Amazon this year.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nJenna Ortega\u2019s Emmy Red Carpet Look Generated $5.6 Million in Media Exposure for Dior at the Emmys\nHow to Watch NCAA Women\u2019s College Basketball on TV (and Where to Find a Livestream Online)\nA New \u2018Barbie\u2019 Book Will Reveal Margot Robbie\u2019s Never-Before-Seen Press Tour Looks, Rare Mattel Photos and More\nHow to Stream \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Season 28 Online Without Cable\nOmega Fetes Andrew Garfield With Dinner During Paris\u00a0Men\u2019s Fashion Week\nOne of the Best 4K Projector TVs Is On Sale Ahead of Your Super Bowl Viewing Party\nMost Popular\nMeghan Markle & Prince Harry Are Reportedly 'Shocked' Over the Controversy Surrounding Daughter Lilibet's Name\nThe Egyptian Government Bulldozed an Iconic Cairo Art Center With \u2018Millions\u2019 in Art Inside\nKobe-Inspired Mamba Foundation Amasses Cash but Spends Little\nH-Town Shares Music Video For \"Strokey Doke\" Starring Drea Kelly\nYou may also like\nThe Best Medicine Balls, According to Fitness Trainers\nFord\u2019s New Mach-E Mustang Bronze Is Its Fastest Electric Model Yet\nGeorge Clinton Reflects On Walk Of Fame Star: \u201cThis Feels Good As\u00a0Sh*t\u201d\nSubscriber Support\nThe Hollywood Reporter\nLegal\nFollow Us\nNewsletter Sign Up\nHave a Tip?\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nOur Sites\nNews\nExpand news menu\nFilm\nExpand film menu\nTV\nExpand tv menu\nAwards\nExpand awards menu\nLifestyle\nExpand lifestyle menu\nBusiness\nExpand business menu\nMore Essentials\nExpand more-essentials menu\nFollow Us\nAlerts & Newsletters\noptional screen reader"

By generating a remarkable 480 frames per second, the 27-inch 480Hz QHD gaming OLED panel provides the optimal gaming experience with its smooth and sharp visuals, even during fast screen transitions.\nThe 34- and 39-inch panels offer an ultra-wide (21:9) aspect ratio for an immersive gaming experience, while the 31.5-inch panel supports a clear UHD (3840\u00d72160) resolution that makes it suitable not only for gaming but also for office work and content consumption.\nLG Display's gaming OLED panels include millions of self-emitting pixels without a separate backlight source to boast high refresh rates and resolutions, as well as a fast response time of 0.03ms. In addition, the company has incorporated 'META Technology' into its OLED gaming displays to further enhance the overall image quality while minimizing external light reflections during darker scenes.\nFurthermore, LG Display will present its full lineup of Transparent OLEDs, including the 30-, 55-, and 77-inch displays, to present new shopping experiences to retail spaces by creating unique applications through the use of mid-sized and ultra-large Transparent OLED panels.\nAs the world's only manufacturer of Transparent OLED, LG Display maximizes OLED's self-emissive nature to achieve a transparency rate high enough to seamlessly replace glass windows, portray accurate color expression, and provide design flexibility that boosts space utilization.\nTransparent OLEDs are also suitable for indoor use thanks to their lower heat generation compared to conventional LEDs, while their versatility allows for installation in almost all spaces and interiors such as windows, walls, and floors of various sizes.\nIn its West Hall booth, LG Display will showcase its ultra-large 'Pillar-to-Pillar (P2P)' display solution optimized for Software Defined Vehicles (SDV), which utilize the company's differentiated automotive display technologies such as P-OLED, ATO (Advanced Thin OLED), and LTPS (Low-Temperature Polysilicon) LCD.\nThe 'Ultra-large P2P P-OLED' seamlessly integrates a '12.3-inch P-OLED' dashboard display and '34-inch P-OLED' center screen to create a sleek, sophisticated design that covers the entire dashboard as a large singular display. Meanwhile, the '48-inch P2P LTPS LCD' boasts an expansive screen that allows drivers and passengers to see useful driving information while enjoying entertainment features.\nWith the emergence of large displays like P2P, LG Display is also introducing its 'Switchable Privacy Mode (SPM),' which effectively keeps the driver's focus on the road by controlling the passenger display's viewing angle.\nLG Display will also showcase solutions that maximize space efficiency within the limited confines of a vehicle while offering new in-car experiences, including the '17-inch Foldable OLED' designed for RSE (Rear Seat Entertainment) and the '18-inch Slidable OLED' that is hidden in the ceiling and can be extended downwards for use.\nIn addition, the company's differentiated 'Thin Actuator Sound Solution', which is just 30 percent of the weight and 10 percent of the thickness of a conventional car speaker, can be installed in various areas inside the vehicle, such as the display, ceiling, and floor, for a richer, more 3D immersive sound experience.\nMoreover, LG Display will present cutting-edge technologies engineered to make spaces more aesthetically pleasing, such as an 'Under Display' that conceals the cameras installed on the display by adjusting the overall transparency, and 'Decorative Film' that allows screens to resemble interior materials such as wood or carbon when inactive.\nBy unveiling display solutions that unlock new experiences for global consumers, LG Display plans to strengthen its business competitiveness even further and secure potential customers through its differentiated products and technologies.\nAbout LG DisplayLG Display Co., Ltd.

        "raw_content": "CES\n2024: LG's Massive OLED TV Ditches Wires and Incorporates (What Else?) AI\nLG's pre-CES announcements include a slew of new home entertainment products, including the wireless, 97-inch M4 OLED TV, ultra-slim G4 OLED TV, and a tiny, high-contrast portable projector.\nCES 2024 isn't until next week, but LG got a head start today by unveiling a slew of home entertainment displays before the show. The company just announced its newest flagship OLED TVs, joining the LED TVs and projector it revealed last week.\nThe LG Signature OLED M4 sits at the top of the heap, as an OLED TV that can wirelessly display video at up to 4K resolution and 144Hz streamed from its separate Zero Connect box. This concept was first showed off last year in the OLED M3, but the new version bumps up the maximum refresh rate from 120Hz to 144Hz, and is 150% brighter in peak highlights, LG says.\nThe M4 will also be available in a 65-inch model as well as the 77-, 83-, and 97-inch sizes we saw on the M3. This makes the M4 more accessible in size and presumably price. LG hasn't announced pricing for its newest TVs yet, but the 65-inch M4 will likely be much less expensive than the 77-inch M3, which retails for $4,999.\nFor OLEDs, LG also updated its high-end G line from G3 to G4. The G4 is a conventional TV compared with the wireless M4, and features a very slim design with a nearly flush wall-mounting option, and is updated with a 144Hz refresh rate and a brighter panel.\nBoth the G4 and M4 incorporates LG's new Alpha 11 image processor, which LG claims features 70% better graphical performance and 30% faster speed. LG's popular C3 OLED TV is also being updated to the C4, as well as the entry-level B3 to the B4, but these appear to be minor, iterative updates that use the same image processor as the previous models.\nLG showed off its newest projector as well. The CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that can display a 4K picture with, according to LG, a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. Its most interesting aspect is its size: at 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches (HWD) and 3.3 pounds, it's extremely small for a 4K projector, comparable in volume and slightly lighter than Samsung's 1080p FreeStyle projector.\nFor LED TVs, LG has announced updates to several of its QNED lines. Most notable is the the flagship QNED90, which has what the company called Million Gray Scale that can display 20-bit grayscale gradation. Like the name implies, this should mean the QNED90 can show many, many more shades of gray than most other LED TVs and likely all OLED TVs for which grayscale and brightness variation are typically more difficult. The QNED85 doesn't feature Million Gray Scale, but it stands as LG's biggest LED TV with a 98-inch model available.\nPricing and availability for these new displays haven't been announced yet, but we'll be on the floor at CES to check them out in person.\nAbout Will Greenwald\nI\u2019ve been PCMag\u2019s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I\u2019ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade.

The entrance featured two large displays showcasing the company\u2019s Life\u2019s Good brand promise incorporating new creative elements aimed at resonating with younger audiences, infusing the brand with a touch of youthful exuberance. This preview set the stage for an exploration of how LG\u2019s advancements in technology are poised to enhance the customer experience to, ultimately, make life better.\nThe spotlight of the show was the LG SIGNATURE OLED T, the world\u2019s first 77-inch 4K wireless transparent TV \u2013 a truly spectacular innovation unlocking new possibilities. The massive media art display, comprised of fifteen 77-inch LG OLED Ts seemingly floating in the air, highlighted the TV\u2019s ability to move freely without being constrained by wires or cords \u2013 a feat made possible by the Zero Connect Box.\nIn the \u2018Life with OLED T\u2019 zone, created in collaboration with premium Dutch lifestyle brand Moooi, LG presented how the LG OLED T can redefine the screen experience, liberating the space and transforming into a design object to open a realm of possibilities like never before. The TV\u2019s Transparent Mode enables it to blend with the surroundings, transcending the traditional dominance of a television and becoming a part of interior design. When it\u2019s time to view content, users simply have to raise the black screen to enjoy the exemplary LG OLED picture quality to the fullest.\nThe zone also featured other TVs, including the Pos\u00e9, a lifestyle TV from the LG OLED Objet Collection, which also elevates the home as an object of d\u00e9cor. The LG StanbyME Go, with its portable briefcase design, adjustable 27-inch touchscreen and 3-hour battery life, prioritizes user convenience and offers ultimate flexibility for on-the-go entertainment.\nThe zone featured more than just TVs. Unveiled for the first time at CES, the LG gram Pro 2-in-1 is the newest model that takes the ultra-lightweight, compact design and powerful performance that LG gram is known for to the next level. Next to the LG gram Pro, visitors had the opportunity to try out the newly unveiled LG MyView Smart Monitor, equipped with LG\u2019s webOS platform, providing access to OTT streaming services, home office applications and various content, all without the need for a PC connection.\nLG\u2019s smart TV platform, webOS, provided a wealth of entertainment and engaging experiences, aligning with LG\u2019s objective to transform into a media and entertainment platform company. Inviting users to explore the world of entertainment powered by webOS, the \u2018webOS Experience Zone\u2019 comprised numerous self-lift OLED displays playing an endless stream of content from webOS content partners. Placed at the end of the tunnel, the 97-inch LG OLED M stood as LG\u2019s first 4K 144Hz wireless TV, powered by Alpha 11, the world\u2019s first processor dedicated to OLED.

        "raw_content": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe 5 best monitors at CES 2024\nThe most exciting displays at the show feature some truly incredible screen specs\nIf you\u2019re a big ol\u2019 display dweeb like myself, CES 2024 is basically Christmas\u2026 just replace the big-boned, beardy dude trespassing on your premises with the best monitors and best TVs being debuted in Las Vegas in front of hordes of excited tech press.\nThe annual Sin City-based mega event has produced some particularly exciting monitors this year, a number of which boast truly ludicrous refresh rates that should have hardcore first-person shooter fans drooling. What\u2019s also becoming increasingly clear is the PC market\u2019s continued love affair with OLED technology is getting more intimate with every passing year.\nWith so many impressive new models being produced from a variety of manufacturers, the days of the traditional IPS panel look increasingly numbered if you demand impeccable black levels from your monitor.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nThe best monitors of CES 2024 so far\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a new monitor, you may want to hold out for another few months until the tantalizing displays below have been released. Some of them look simply sensational. Here are some of the best monitors we\u2019ve seen from CES so far. Buckle up screen nerds: your peepers are in for quite the ride.\n1. Acer Predator Z57\nEven as someone who owns a 49-inch gaming monitor, this thing is just silly. Yet silly in the best possible way. The Acer Predator Z57 is a colossal 57-inch, 120Hz ultrawide gaming monitor that essentially has the same screen real estate of a couple of 4K displays. It\u2019s resolution? A frankly absurd 7,680 x 2,160. Let that number sink in for a second.\nThe Z57 further impresses with 1000R curvature, which should make for quite the wraparound viewing experience in some of the best PC games. Throw in the fact it\u2019s capable of hitting 1000 nits of brightness in HDR mode and hits 98% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and this titan should produce beautifully accurate, utterly vibrant pictures. Just make sure you go out and purchase a desk the size of a park bench if you\u2019re planning on buying this beast.\n2. Asus ROG Swift PG27 (2024)\nThe Asus ROG Swift PG27 has always been an excellent monitor series, but this year the company is really taking things to the next level with more than a little help from Nvidia. Alongside a number of other monitors from Dell and Philips, the latest PG27 boasts the latest evolution of Team Green's G-Sync technology.\nCalled G-Sync Pulsar, Nvidia describes it as \u201cthe next evolution of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) technology\u201d. Said fps-smoothing tech promises to deliver not only the usual stutter-free gaming experiences you\u2019d expect from the best G-Sync monitors, but the company claims it will set \u201ca new gold standard for visual clarity and fidelity through the invention of variable frequency strobing\u201d. Nvidia promises the latest ROG Swift PG27 will boast effective motion clarity to over 1000Hz. So if you\u2019re looking for a gaming monitor capable of producing potentially the smoothest gameplay experiences we\u2019ve ever seen, this currently looks like the model to beat.\n3. Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 (2024)\nBoy, does my timing ever suck when it comes to buying new monitors. I caved and picked up the awesome Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 in an admittedly delicious Black Friday deal late last year, but now I have serious display envy thanks to the announcement of the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8. Last year\u2019s model was already a terrific gaming monitor with a screen resolution of 3,440 x 1,440 and a gorgeous OLED panel that sported a 175Hz refresh rate.\nSamsungs\u2019 latest model (full title the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 G80SD), is a different beast entirely. For one thing, this 32-inch OLED gaming monitor ditches the previous G8\u2019s ultrawide aspect ratio in favor of a more traditional 16:9 form factor. That\u2019s instantly going to make it more accessible to those with limited desk space.\nThe most exciting stat is that the new G8 rocks an astoundingly speedy 240Hz refresh rate. Pair that with its 4K display (3,840 x 2,160) and response times of just 0.03ms, and this should be one hell of a gaming screen if you\u2019ve got a powerful enough GPU/CPU combo to squeeze the most out of its stunning specs.\n4. Alienware AW3225QF\nDespite the fact the amazing Alienware AW3423DWF is currently boxed up in my bedroom ready to be sold on eBay \u2014 mainly because I bought that Samsung G9 I mentioned above \u2014 I really do love Alienware monitors. I\u2019ve owned several down the years, and from a specs perspective, the Alienware AW3225QF looks to be the most impressive gaming monitor Dell has manufactured to date.\nThe headline, oh so exciting facts for display nerds? This is a 32-inch, 4K OLED monitor that has a refresh rate of 240Hz. Predictably being OLED, response times are currently quoted at just 0.03ms. Color accuracy should also be excellent, with the AW3225QF covering 99% of the DCI-P3 gamut. This panel's PPI (pixels per inch) is also higher than any existing OLED gaming monitor at 140 PPI \u2014 most existing OLED monitors max out at just over 100 PPI. My only slight concern with this is could be overly pronounced pixel density on a 32-inch screen.\nBut hey, that\u2019s ultra nerdy nitpicking on my part. This baby looks like the real deal, and we could easily see it sitting atop our picks of the best gaming monitors later in the year. It launches later this month for what I'd argue is a pretty reasonable $1,199.\n5. LG\u2019s new 480Hz monitor\nIf you\u2019re in full \u201cMaverick Mode\u201d and are craving the need for ALL the speed, LG\u2019s currently unnamed new 27-inch OLED display could be the gaming monitors of your dreams. While it may not have an official moniker yet, we know that this 1440p (or QHD) display features a refresh rate of \u2014 wait for it \u2014 480Hz. If you\u2019re an aspiring future eSports champ, you may have just found the monitor to power your aspiring competitive gaming fantasies.\nThis new LG monitor\u2019s screen credentials are further boosted by LG Display's \u201cMETA technology\u201d, last seen in the sensational LG G3 OLED TV. Essentially, it\u2019s a type of software solution that in the case of the G3, combined with that television\u2019s Micro Lens Array panel to create one of the brightest and best OLED TVs we\u2019ve ever reviewed. When this monitor finally gets a name, expect its HDR performance to be almost impressive as that head-spinning refresh rate.\nCheck out our CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

By generating a remarkable 480 frames per second, the 27-inch 480Hz QHD gaming OLED panel provides the optimal gaming experience with its smooth and sharp visuals, even during fast screen transitions.\nThe 34- and 39-inch panels offer an ultra-wide (21:9) aspect ratio for an immersive gaming experience, while the 31.5-inch panel supports a clear UHD (3840\u00c3\u20142160) resolution that makes it suitable not only for gaming but also for office work and content consumption.\nLG Display's gaming OLED panels include millions of self-emitting pixels without a separate backlight source to boast high refresh rates and resolutions, as well as a fast response time of 0.03ms.
