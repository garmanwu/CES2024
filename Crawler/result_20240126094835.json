        "raw_content": "Launching an IoT Product with Dimension Four and Memfault\nComplexity of the I in IoT\nWhether the IoT project is designing a sensor, smart home appliance, asset tracker, or otherwise, the journey is similar.\nThe first step is to assemble the right talent to build the device hardware, firmware and the rest of the system to perform the function. Next, you typically will pick a device architecture (MCU, OS, etc.) suitable for the project requirements. With these decisions made, you set out and begin implementing the application.\nThe question is \u2013 what must you build from scratch, and what exists that you can integrate? There are two significant areas of an IoT application that you should consider leveraging great solutions already available:\nYour design likely requires data communication through a connection to a mobile device and/or in the cloud to send and receive information or execute commands. To implement this:\nSource: https://docs.dimensionfour.io/\nIn diagnostics, your support and engineering teams will need a plan on how to manage the reliability and quality of your device, troubleshoot problems, and update software as features improve. Effectively, you need a way to connect your development team to your operational environment, enabling observability, debugging, and firmware deployment via a strong feedback loop.\nTo implement a solution like this, you need to:\nTo build this solution on your own, you will need to hire new engineers with new skillsets. The hiring and onboarding process, coupled with the many design decisions, will make the original project timeline grow substantially. Once you implement the solution, you will continue to maintain and invest in improvements for the life of the product.\nDimension Four and Memfault\nMemfault and Dimension Four help companies eliminate the schedule creep that kills time to market, decrease engineering and overhead costs, and build better-performing products that sell better in the marketplace.\nSolving the Data Querying Challenge\nDimension Four solves the challenge of efficiently getting your data to the cloud or mobile application with their IoT-as-a-service offering. At its core is GraphQL, a specification that describes a query language for internet-connected applications that ask an API for the exact data they want. Why does that matter? The Dimension Four GraphQL API is built to meet the requirements of an IoT system for communication both ways between the embedded sensors and the data science and application layer. It is a more efficient way to structure requests and data receipt than using other solutions such as a Rest API.\nSolving Observability and Remote Diagnostics\nWith Memfault, teams are able to observe devices operating in customer environments for any signs of firmware or hardware issues. Memfault gives engineers the information and visualization of device state to determine the problem to inform a fix in firmware and then a FOTA management platform to complete the cycle. Memfault delivers a feature-rich, quick-to-integrate platform with a lightweight, device-side firmware component that collects the data, a cloud-based backend that then reconstructs and analyzes the data, and a cloud-based user interface that visualizes the data and insights for the user to leverage. Why does it matter? With the ability to see and fix issues remotely, you do not rely on customer complaints for issue detection or troubleshooting RMAs for identification allowing you to facilitate improvements intelligently.\nNext Steps: Solving your IoT problems\nMemfault and Dimension Four have a partnership to deliver our products individually and help solve and scale your IoT challenges together. Our clients use our technology together to solve their data and observability challenges in new and innovative ways, including:\nReady to get started?\nLooking for more help? We offer complete IoT solutions via our joint partnership with The New Normal Group, which provides a vast array of services to help you develop IoT products from an initial idea through an entire operational lifecycle.

Partech led the round, with participation from existing investor Uncork Capital. The Series A will allow Memfault to quickly scale its engineering team to meet accelerated demand from IoT device makers and make significant investments across product development and marketing.\n\u201cMemfault\u2019s smart-device platform modernizes device monitoring, debugging, and deployment of updates, improving time-to-market and overall device health \u2013 all without impacting the end user.\u201d said Jean Sini, General Partner at Partech. \u201cThe company\u2019s growth over the past few years underscores the demand for a better, more cost-effective, and simpler method of managing device fleets at scale, and we\u2019re excited to support Memfault\u2019s vision.\u201d\n\u201cAs an early investor in several hardware startups, we recognized that Memfault solved a problem no one else did by empowering developers to get ahead of potential issues, leading to faster production, better products, and happier end-users,\u201d said Jeff Clavier, founder and managing partner of Uncork Capital. \u201cWith the executive team\u2019s deep domain experience in hardware development, Memfault\u2019s diagnostic tools completely transform traditional hardware practices that can\u2019t match the pace of the smart device industry. We\u2019ve been thrilled to watch the success of Memfault as it extends its reach in response to the exponential growth of connected devices across all market sectors.\u201d\nMemfault launched in 2018 with a founding team of embedded engineers from Pebble, Fitbit, and Oculus to solve the slow, inefficient, costly, and reactive processes that continued to plague firmware engineering teams. This passive process effectively relied on customers to be product testers as the first indication of a device issue often came through unhappy users contacting customer service or voicing dissatisfaction more publicly through social media and product review channels. With 30 billion IoT devices predicted to be in use by 2025, traditional hardware monitoring and debugging methods can not keep pace with the increase of smart device adoption and the complexity of connectivity blocking teams from scaling their fleet of devices.\nMemfault\u2019s cloud-based firmware observability platform dramatically reduces engineering and support overhead by enabling teams to deploy OTA firmware updates, automatically capture and remotely debug issues, and continuously monitor fleets of connected devices at scale. Memfault\u2019s SDK can be deployed on any connected device to capture data and send it to the cloud for analysis. Memfault\u2019s backend identifies, classifies, and deduplicates error reports, so engineers know what issues are most prevalent, and where the issue occurs without requiring any action from end-users.\nKey Features of Memfault\nBy integrating Memfault into smart device infrastructure, developer teams can monitor and manage the entire device lifecycle, from development to feature updates, with ease and speed.\nKey features include:\n\u201cAt Latch, we are always looking to make our Access product simpler, faster and more reliable,\u201d said Raman Thapar, Director of Engineering at Latch. \u201cOur latest keyless product demanded that we raise the bar on these fronts to new heights. Memfault gives us the hard data to be confident in the reliability of our firmware and proactively take action, resolving issues before our users are impacted. These real-time device-level metrics and alerts have streamlined engineering processes and improved the overall health of our devices immensely.\u201d\n\u201cIn 2020, Diamond Kinetics launched a new generation of our product and built Memfault in from the beginning,\u201d said Mike Ressler, CTO at Diamond Kinetics. \u201cBecause of the monitoring and automatic data collection capabilities that Memfault gave us, we were able to go to market faster with more confidence in the success of our launch. With our new product on the market, we can now service and address issues without needing to \u201cpsychic debug\u201d sensors in the wild based on customer reports \u2013 we have the stack traces. All this on an embedded sensor with limited resources over a Bluetooth connection to a mobile app. Every step of the way, the Memfault SDK has been reliable and easy to integrate. I wouldn\u2019t go to market on an IoT device without Memfault in place.\u201d\n\u201cDespite the ubiquity of connected devices, hardware teams are too often bound by a lack of visibility into device health and a reactive cycle of waiting to be notified of potential issues,\u201d said Fran\u00e7ois Baldassari, CEO of Memfault. \u201cMemfault has reimagined hardware diagnostics to instead operate with the similar flexibility, speed, and innovation that has proven so successful with software development. Memfault has saved our customers millions of dollars and engineering hours, and empowered teams to approach product development with the confidence that they can ship better products, faster, with the knowledge they can fix bugs, patch, and update without ever disrupting the user experience. This funding round allows us to grow our teams and build out our platform to meet the significant growth in demand for our scalable, simple solution.\u201d\nThe company will soon be releasing a self-service version of the Memfault platform to streamline integration for developers. Sign up today for early access to the release.\nResources:\nAbout Memfault\nMemfault is the first cloud-based platform for connected device debugging, monitoring, and updating, which brings the efficiencies and innovation of software development to hardware processes.

While it\u2019s been two years in the making, we\u2019ve officially reached a generative nexus point, conceding to admit that ChatGPT has reshaped an entire industry \u2014 the automated future is now. Pretty much everyone from Big Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, to itty-bitty startups with big Kickstarter dreams hailed their usage of generative AI at this year\u2019s show \u2014 whether or not it deserved to fit into the products themselves, however, is another matter entirely.\nYes, it feels like nearly every new announcement was boasting a \u201csmarter\u201d future with the help of artificial intelligence, from AI binoculars for the savvy birder, to an adjustable electric toothbrush that feels like putting an entire computer in your mouth. It was overwhelming at times, given 2023\u2019s show focused mostly on minor improvements to existing flagship products as opposed to bold new swing-for-the-fences technologies.\nStill, we were still surprised and delighted by some key product innovations, AI-infused and otherwise. So we dug through the digital noise, watched press conferences, and even live-streamed product demos, and found 32 gadgets deserving of our Rolling Stone \u201cBest Of CES 2024\u201d Award.\nWe chose our CES 2024 award winners based on design, functionality and innovation, focusing on unique products that help solve everyday problems, upgrade our life, or push the limits of technology. Scroll through to see the companies and products that made our Best of CES 2024 list.\nLG Signature OLED T Transparent TV\nAfter a ho-hum year of TV releases from usual titans of the small screen Samsung and Sony, the buzziest model at CES year by far proves that, sure, you can always go bigger and brighter \u2014 but transparency has never looked cooler.\nLG\u2019s new Signature OLED T isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel \u2014 transparent OLED technology has been around for years commercially. But for the first time in 2024, LG is making the see-through TV a must-have part of your home entertainment setup. We actually saw their transparent OLED concept in-person at last year\u2019s show, and while it\u2019s not clear-as-glass, this living room-ready model combines the best parts of their M4 series with \u201ccool factor\u201d of being able to turn your TV into an eye-catching piece of home decor (the transparent fish tank demo we saw was certainly better than anything the Samsung Frame can do).\nSpeaking of the M4 series, the OLED T smartly supports LG\u2019s \u201cZero Connect\u201d wireless connectivity: an external box housing all the HDMI connections and media players you need with the ability to beam 4K 120Hz video straight to the screen from up to 30 feet away. Overall, LG\u2019s OLED T is firing on all cyllinders when it comes to attention to design detail, and that\u2019s the transparent truth. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on LG for\n$TBD\nHP Omen Transcend 14 Laptop\nGaming laptops tend to have a certain kind of intense look to reflect all the ultra-high-powered software packed within \u2014 big and bulky designs, flashy RGB keyboard lighting, etc. HP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 may not look the part, but this ultraportable has stealthily become one of the best gaming laptops around.\nIt packs a lot of power into a slim design, all thanks to the Meteor Lake chip, with a processor\u2019s NPU that can handle running a streaming application like OBS while the CPU and GPU focuses on the game you\u2019re currently playing. There\u2019s an option of 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and the display is a 14-inch OLED with a 2880 x 1800 resolution and up to a 120Hz refresh rate (as with most of the laptops announced during CES this year, it also\u00a0 supports Wi-Fi 7).\nIf you love to game, but still want your laptop to pull double duty at the office or for your personal needs, HP\u2019s new Omen Transcend 14 shows that big power can come in a sleek, lightweight package.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on HP for\n$1,499.99\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Earbuds\nSennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 are the latest impressively-engineered wireless earbuds from one of our favorite audio companies around.\nThe earbuds might look nearly identical to their predecessors, but they feature massive upgrades to ANC, powerful enough to cancel out noisy commutes and the hum of an airplane. Transparency mode is also more natural sounding than ever before, and Sennheiser also says the buds get a respectable seven and a half hours of battery life with noise-cancelling turned off.\nBut the highlight here is a new audio chipset which gives the buds improved sound, good bass, and a crisper quality (this is thanks to Qualcomm\u2019s S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless support). There were a lot of earbuds unveiled at CES this year, but the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4s impressive technology and improved features made them stand out.\u00a0Releases: February 15.\nBuy on Sennheiser\n$299\nRabbit R1 AI\nDescribed by Time as potentially the \u201ciPhone of AI\u201d, Rabbit R1 swept CES 2024 as\u00a0the definitive AI-powered companion that feels like having a personal assistant right in your pocket \u2014 and clearly 20,000 people agreed, selling out the first batch of units in a single day, and then the second batch by Thursday.\nThe R1 is so ambitious that you can\u2019t help but believe it might just replace your smartphone someday. But what does it do exactly? Powered by a \u201cLarge Action Model,\u201d this retro-looking device is more advanced than it looks, and in the simplest terms, it\u2019s a universal controller for your apps.

At roughly 0.2 pounds, they\u2019re lightweight enough to feel comfortable for extended wear, and support full motion tracking (6DoF, or six degrees of freedom), so it can tell whether you\u2019re moving around in a space.\nInteracting with the various screens and menus through the glasses is a breeze, and the Air 2 Ultras as surprisingly responsive to the \u201cpinching\u201d movement meant to navigate apps (similar to the \u201cDouble Tap\u201d on the new Apple Watch Series 9).\u00a0 When viewing 2D content, it\u2019s like looking at a 154-inch display from 13 feet away.

Users can then share those results with a doctor via smartphone, and even \u201clivestream\u201d their stethoscope audio over telehealth appointments.\nWithings are currently waiting for FDA approval, but we\u2019re excited about BeamO\u2019s prospects, putting the power of an EmergiMed in the palm of your hands.\u00a0Releases: Summer 2024.\nBuy on Withings for\n$250\nXGIMI Horizon Max Projector\nThe future is bright for XGIMI\u2019s Horizon Max Projector, one of the most impressive projectors we\u2019ve ever seen. It delivers IMAX-level picture quality with time-saving setup features to make it the ultimate home cinema package.\nThe first long-throw projector to feature the IMAX Enhanced certification, the Horizon Max is their brightest model to date thanks to the use of triple MCL lasers typically found in commercial theater projectors. This means it can project a 180-inch screen with a whopping 3,100 ISO lumens of brightness, all in a super-portable package.\nBut you won\u2019t just be blinded by the light \u2014 you\u2019ll be impressed by how intelligent the Horizon Max can be too with \u201cIntelligent Screen Adaptation\u201d technology. The projector sends signals to the wall and measures the angle and the distance, accurately auto-correcting and auto-focusing within seconds. No more wasting time focus-correcting, since your picture will be sharp and bright no matter where you aim it.\nBy boosting the brightness and picture quality and eliminating unecessary setup fuss, XGIMI\u2019s small yet mighty Horizon Max is the new golden standard for \u201cpoint and play\u201d projectors.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy Horizon Max Projector $TBD\nMore News\nThese Small Space Heaters Help Warm Up Your Home, Office or Studio\nHow to Watch the Complete 'Sex and the City' Series Online Free\n25 Valentine's Day Gift Ideas for the Jewelry Lover in Your Life\n'60 Minutes': Everything You Need to Know About How to Stream the Acclaimed News Series Online\nLuxurious Murder: How to Watch 'Death and Other Details' Online\nThe Latest\nNorah Jones Returns With New Album 'Visions,' First Single 'Running'\nPost Malone, Reba McEntire, Andra Day Lead 2024 Super Bowl Pre-Game\nTrump Demands Total Presidential Immunity \u2014 Even for Acts That 'Cross the Line'\nRichard Simmons Disavows Pauly Shore-Starring Biopic in Rare Statement\nThe digital daily newsletter\nMost Popular\n\u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Leads Critics Choice Awards With 8 Wins, \u2018Barbie\u2019 Scores 6 \u2014 Full Winners List\nEmmy Awards: Winners List\nNew Photos Prove Patrick & Brittany Mahomes\u2019 Children Have the Same, Grumpy Facial Expression\nUnsealed Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0Documents Spark New Allegations against Collector Leslie Wexner\nYou might also like\nDana Carvey Returns to Work After Son\u2019s Death and Calls \u2018Riffing\u2019 With David Spade on Their Podcast \u2018Very Healthy\u2019; Chris Farley\u2019s Mom Wrote Him a Letter of Support\nMaison & Objet, Olympic Torch Designer Turns Focus to Pioneering\u00a0Solutions\nThe Best Treadmills Under $500, According to Personal Trainers\n2024 BAFTA Nominations: \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Dominates, See Full List\nFresno State Title IX Lacrosse Suit Revives Class Push on\u00a0Appeal\nFollow Us\nNewsletter Signup\nGot a Hot News Tip?\nWe want to hear it.

        "raw_content": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Quiller Media, Inc.\nContact Us | Privacy Policy\nHere are the best new devices from CES Unveiled 2024\nCES Unveiled 2024\nOn Sunday, CES 2024 kicked off with its annual Unveiled media event that highlights various brands launching new products for the coming year. AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design.

        "raw_content": "December 2023\nImproved Processing Log: More data, better discoverability, more tools\u200b\nThe Processing Log has been updated to cover more processing-related activity,\nimprove discoverability and make it easier to take action. The update adds\nmultiple new filtering options including hardware version, software version and\nlog level (e.g. Errors or Info). It also adds multiple new ways to take action\non the information, including shareable links for each log, a download of the\nlog for further investigation, and a quick link to upload missing symbol files.\nThe introduction of the processing log will make the initial integration much\neasier, providing instant feedback for a developer encountering unexpected\nbehavior during integration. For customers already using Memfault this will\nprovide much greater visibility of project related data processing and errors\nthat might impacting the completeness of their data. Users can read more about\nthe\nProcessing log in Memfault\u2019s documentation.\nNew charts for tracking Crashes and Reboots\u200b\nUsers can now add two new chart types into their custom dashboards - Reboots and\n\u201cCrashes per 10k hours\u201d. The Reboots chart gives visibility into the breakdown\nof different reboot reasons across each data set. The \u201cCrashes per 10K hours\u201d\nprovides a calculation of the average number of crashes (unexpected reboots)\nacross a minimum of 10,000 operating hours.\nThese new charts give teams a way to track the stability of their devices and\nmeasure and compare software quality across distinct populations. Teams will now\nbe able to definitively measure software quality improvements or regressions\nbetween versions and even compare software stability across product lines. The\nReboot chart is available to all users but the Crashes per 10k hours chart is\ncurrently only available to MCU customers. You can read more about these\nnew charts in Memfault's documentation.\nNovember 2023\nBuild your own dashboards in Memfault\u200b\nUsers can now create custom dashboards and manage the layout of content within\nthese new dashboards. This change makes dashboards much more flexible, able to\ncope with a wider variety of use cases such as dashboards for specific teams,\nsoftware versions, cohorts, etc. Users can also re-arrange the content within\nthe dashboard using drag, drop and resize functionality.\nCreate and manage dashboards in the\nAll Dashboards\ntab within the \u201cDashboards\u201d sub-menu and customize chart layouts using the\n\u201cLayout mode\u201d toggle available within each dashboard. Find out more about\ncreating custom dashboards\nand using layout mode in Memfault\u2019s\ndocumentation.\nImproved issue management with tags\u200b\nUsers can now add tags to issues within Memfault and use the tags to filter\nissue searches and build issue charts. This change facilitates more\nsophisticated issue triaging, grouping and categorization within Memfault. For\nexample, tags could be used to indicate issue priority and also to associate\ngroups of related but separate issues together.\nA user can add tags in the issue view, each issue can carry multiple tags and\ntags can be added or removed at any time.\nBetter visibility of processing errors\u200b\nUsers can now view a detailed listing of processing errors in the\nProcessing Log\nunder the \u201cIntegration Hub\u201d sub-menu. The Processing Log contains details on\nerrors such as missing symbol files on coredump upload, MAR file processing\nerrors and instances of device data not being accepted by the server. This\nchange adds a huge amount of additional visibility into errors related to\nprocessing of device data in Memfault.\nThese processing errors are now also reported on the device timeline adding\nanother layer of debugging information for devices. Users can read more about\nthe Processing Log in Memfault\u2019s documentation.\nOctober 2023\nExport lists of Devices as a CSV\u200b\nUsers can now bulk export lists of Devices and associated information as a CSV\nfile. Use filters as normal to define the desired list of Devices and then\nexport that list as a CSV. Once the CSV is generated it will be emailed to the\nuser. This makes it easy to share information on specific groups of Devices to\nteams in the organization outside of Memfault for the purpose of further\nprocessing in external tools or scripts for logistics, reporting, etc.\nBy default on export the CSV will include basic information about the Device\nsuch as serial number, cohort, software and hardware version etc. and a user can\nalso choose to include custom attributes in the export if required.\nSee data in Metric charts as soon as it\u2019s received\u200b\nData in Metric charts is now available in \u201creal-time\u201d once received. Previously,\ndata in Metric charts only updated once the day in UTC completes and this would\nadd some delay in the insights the Metric charts were able to provide. Now the\nMetric data collected from devices is visible in Metric charts as soon as it is\nreceived by Memfault.\nThis enhancement will allow users to react quicker to undesirable changes in\nbehavior and provide closer to real-time information during significant events\nlike software version roll-outs. Currently, this change is only applicable to\nMetric charts and does not apply to other chart types (e.g. Issues charts,\nDevice set charts, etc).\nSeptember 2023\nSoftware versions displayed in Device Timeline\u200b\nDevice Timeline now includes a visualization of the active software version on\nthe device alongside the metric and traces information. This allows a user to\nvery quickly associate any metric behavior, crash or reboot event with the\nactive software version at the time.\nAs demonstrated in the screenshot, this should also make it very easy to\nidentify if a change of behavior coincides with a change in software version.\nThe software version is now displayed by default across all Devices on all\nplatforms.\nBest Practice Guide: Using MQTT with Memfault\u200b\nWe have released a new best practices guide covering the use of the MQTT\nprotocol with Memfault. Correct set-up for your MQTT implementation is critical\nas errors in set-up can result in data loss or data being decoded incorrectly\nrendering it impossible for Memfault to deliver accurate insights.\nThe guide provides a basic introduction to MQTT and specific advice for users\nlooking to optimize their MQTT stack to ensure reliable data delivery to\nMemfault. Topics covered include:\nRead the full MQTT guide in our best\npractice documentation.\nAugust 2023\nNew Data Aggregation for Metric Charts: Percentiles\u200b\nMetric Charts now have a new data aggregation available for both chart rollup\noptions (by Cohort or Software version, and Over Time). This aggregation is\ncalled \u201cPercentiles\u201d and will display the data set broken into the 1st, 5th,\n50th, 95th and 99th percentiles. Displaying the metric data as percentiles makes\nit easier to understand the prevalence of behaviors (tracked as metrics) across\nyour fleet.\nAs an example, if you are seeing significant spikes in battery discharge rates\nfor a specific software version you can use percentile aggregation to get a\nclearer picture of the scale of this problem. Are these undesirable metric\nreadings I am receiving contained to a small set of samples or is this a wide\nscale problem? Conversely, this aggregation should also make it easier to\nunderstand what \u201cnormal\u201d actually looks like across your fleet.\nThis new aggregation is the default view when creating any new metric chart. You\ncan read more about this new data aggregation in our\nMetric Charts documentation.\nBest Practices Guide for Android Battery Debugging\u200b\nOur Developer Experience team have released a new guide designed to help users\nget the most from Memfault when identifying and debugging battery issue on\nAndroid devices. This guide provides detail on:\nThe guide takes into account the recently released set of updates to our\nAndroid SDK with version 4.8.0\nwhich included the addition of new battery usage metrics such as per app battery\nusage.\nYou can read the full guide in the\nMemfault Best Practices for Android Battery Debugging.\nJuly 2023\nBulk Issue Merging improvements\u200b\nUsers can now merge multiple issues together with a few clicks, eliminating the\npreviously repetitive process of merging each issue independently. This\naddresses the scenarios where Memfault\u2019s de-duplication algorithm may not group\nrelated issues due to unaccounted for variables within the issue signature\nmaking each appear as an independent issue.\nUsers can now use all of the filtering capabilities within the issues page to\nnarrow down to a specific issue set and either bulk select or individually\nselect a set of issues they believe should be merged into one issue. You can\nread more about issues and bulk merging in the\nIssue Management\ndocumentation.\nAndroid SDK 4.8.0: More OTA control, more metrics and more issue tracking\u200b\nThe most recent\nAndroid SDK 4.8.0\nintroduces a number of new features for Android customers. Android customers now\nget powerful additional controls for the OTA update process, more granular\nbattery usage metrics and tracking of SELinux violations.\nThe OTA improvements allow users to control download and install behavior\nindependently and dependent on additional payload specific metadata and/or\ncurrent device condition. For example, you can ensure that devices will\nprioritize updates a user has tagged as \u201ccritical\u201d for download and will only\ninstall an update if certain battery conditions are met. You can read more about\nthe specific configurations in Memfault\u2019s documentation on\nconfiguring download and install\nfor OTA updates.\nThe changes to battery metrics allow users to view the battery usage per app,\ndistinguish usage in screen-on or screen-off scenarios, and see battery\ncapacity, all on the device timeline view. This gives much more granular\nvisibility into battery performance and further enhance users\u2019 ability to root\ncause issues. You can read more about this in\nMemfault\u2019s Android Battery Summary Metrics\ndocumentation.\nFinally, we added support for tracking\nSELinux violations\nvia Memfault. Tracking these issues will now be possible with all of the same\nfunctionality as the other pre-existing Android issue types.\nJune 2023\nMetric Charts: Comparison by Software Version or Cohort\u200b\nMetric charts have been enhanced with the addition of a new chart type\npresenting a direct comparison version to version or cohort to cohort without\ntime as a variable. This new chart type presents a comparison of min/mean/max\ndata aggregated across the entire comparison populations based on your selection\n(e.g. min/mean/max ever reported on v1.0.0 vs min/mean/max ever reported\non v.1.0.1).\nThe pre-existing \u201cover-time\u201d chart view restricts comparison to an 8 week window\nwhich is great for intensive monitoring but less good at judging absolute\nperformance. This new chart type allows users to make more effective performance\ncomparisons in real-world scenarios and take decisions with more confidence.\nYou can read more about this new chart type\nin Memfault's documentation.\nIncreased Configurability for Alerting and Notifications\u200b\nAlerting and\nnotification functionality has received a set of\nsignificant enhancements. These include the introduction of configurable\nincident start and end delays, the ability to decide at which stages of an\nincident a user wants a notification, and increased control over the scheduling\nfor incident summary notifications.\nThese changes are designed to give users greater control on an alert-by-alert\nbasis over the alerting behavior and incident related notifications, reducing\nunnecessary \u201cnoise\u201d without sacrificing visibility. Ultimately these changes\nhelp ensure alerts trigger notifications which are highly relevant and timely.\nYou can read more about these changes to alerting, incidents and notifications\nin Memfault's documentation.\nMay 2023\nSimplified Debugging with Device Timezone in Memfault\u200b\nThe Timezone selector allow users to adjust the timezone within which all\ninformation viewed in Memfault is contextualized for that session. Currently,\nthe timezone selections available include \u201cBrowser\u201d (browser default),\n\u201cUniversal\u201d (UTC), \u201cDevice\u201d (configurable) and \u201cCustom\u201d (region selection).\nTimezone selection within Memfault is designed to make it easier for\ninternational teams working with globally deployed devices to contextualize,\ncoordinate and collaborate. Whether you want to standardize working within the\n\u201cUniversal\u201d timezone across your team, or you want to use the \u201cCustom\u201d or\n\u201cDevice\u201d options to adjust your session to the specific local timezone of a\ndevice you are debugging, having this type of control over context can be\npowerful.\nTo provide a specific example, let\u2019s say you receive a report of a customer\nhaving an issue with a device via your support team. The end user has reported a\nproblem at 11am this morning. Rather than the developer needing to do the\ncalculation manually they can just adjust to the correct \u201cCustom\u201d timezone\nassuming they know where that device was located. This process is even quicker\nif \u201cDevice\u201d timezone is configured and takes a single click with no additional\ninformation required.\nThis month we made some improvements to the function of the \u201cDevice\u201d timezone\nselection for Android devices. This selection is now available by default for\nAndroid devices using the\npersist.sys.timezone\nsystem property.\nYou can read more about timezones here and about the Android specific \u201cDevice\u201d\ntimezone metric collection\nhere.\nApril 2023\nServer-Side Support for Developer Mode\u200b\nDeveloper Mode now allows you to temporarily remove any server-side rate\nlimiting on devices from within the device view. This new functionality gives\nyou full control over your integration/testing process with no imposed\nrequirement to pause or prematurely switch between devices because a rate limit\nhas been hit.\nThis will make it easier to integrate, configure and test new Memfault features\nand accelerate the testing, debugging and feature development processes of your\nown products using Memfault.\nDeveloper Mode is activated on a per-device basis and will remove all rate\nlimiting for uploads from the device to Memfault of coredumps, bug reports,\nheartbeats and other data. This\nServer-Side Developer Mode\nfunctionality is an extension of the existing device-side Developer Mode\n(Android,\nLinux) and they can be\nused in tandem or independently.\nMemfault Support for Cortex-R\u200b\nMemfault has expanded its coverage of Arm-based devices adding support for\ncoredumps on Arm Cortex-R. This allows customers to realize the full value of\nthe Memfault monitoring, debugging and update capabilities on more of their\nArm-based devices.\nFor customers already familiar with integrating the Memfault Firmware SDK on\nCortex-M devices, the process for Cortex-R-based devices is very similar, with\nthe only minor difference in the integration of the exception/interrupt handlers\non Cortex-R. For more information on how to complete the integration, please\nreview our Arm Cortex-R integration guide.\nMarch 2023\nNew Access Control Permissions: Teams and Roles\u200b\nMemfault added new concepts for access control: Teams are a flexible way to\ngroup members of an organization. They can reflect an actual company structure\nwith functions such as \u201cquality assurance\u201d or \u201cfirmware engineering.\u201d\nAlternatively, with Roles, administrators can design teams solely to manage\npermissions more conveniently when assigning dedicated roles on a per-project\nlevel.\nTeams and Roles allow for configuration scenarios\nsuch as \u201cread-only access for this department\u201d or \u201cOTA must only ever be\nperformed by these four people.\u201d They further allow for sophisticated setups\nsuch as \u201cthese five contractors may only ever see this one project and nothing\nelse\u201d or \u201cnewly invited members of the organization can do anything with our\nplayground project but are otherwise limited to read-only access.\u201d\nUsing this new system is strictly optional as all members of an organization are\npart of the group \u201ceveryone\u201d that grants permission to all of Memfault\u2019s\nfeatures by default."
