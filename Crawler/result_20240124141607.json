        "raw_content": "Harman Reveals Astounding Tech And Safety Creations At CES 2024\nFrom entertainment to safety, Harman has released several new features for OEMs.\nSamsung-owned tech company Harman has revealed various new in-car features at CES 2024. These features can be quickly adapted by OEMs who want to easily add new features or functions to their products. Harman has covered almost everything from safety to entertainment systems with its latest innovations.\nReady Vision QVUE & AR HUD\nDesigned to keep the driver's eyes on the road, Ready Vision makes for a safer driving experience by projecting information onto the lower part of the windscreen. This lets motorists briefly glance down at their speed and other vital data without distracting them from what's ahead.\nReady Vision QVUE uses a cost-effective HDR-capable reflective display that emits a strong resolution display quality. By installing third-party apps from the Harman Ignite Store, customers can monitor their EV charge status or keep updated with the latest weather reports. EV owners also benefit from turn-by-turn navigation for EV charging stations. Drivers can purchase food through Ready Vision and pick it up in restaurants.\nOEMs can choose from different display sizes, from instrument clusters to pillar-to-pillar windscreen coverage. With augmented reality software (artificial intelligence), the system helps keep the driver alert with hazard detection, 3D navigation, and real-time traffic visuals.\nReady Upgrade Base and Advanced\nThe Ready Upgrade systems enable OEMs to introduce entertainment upgrades to their vehicles in as little as six months. These domain controllers promise future-proof technology, with two models aimed at different segments. The Pre-Certified IP69 Base Domain Controllers are aimed at adventure vehicles and utility SUVs (like the Ineos Grenadier).\nThe Ready Upgrade Base combines vehicle infotainment and the cluster on an eight-inch screen. The Advanced Domain Controllers have been designed with high-end vehicles in mind, as luxury brands may want to add more safety features and displays within the car. Like the QVUE, it is compatible with third-party apps.\nReady Care Driver Activity Detection & Life Presence Detection\nTouted as an industry-first in-cabin monitoring product, Ready Care measures the driver's cognitive and visual load. This can identify potential distractions or fatigue, which the system aims to remedy by offering interventions to improve safety. The visual and mental cognitive load measurement is remarkable and uses AI, neuroscience, and machine learning to classify a driver's behavior.\nOther features include Driver Activity Detection, which monitors whether the driver's hands are on the steering wheel or are engaged in other activities, such as smoking, eating, or using their phone. The Life Presence Detection system is essential and can distinguish between child and adult occupants. This is crucial, as safety features like airbags and seatbelts can only operate correctly if appropriately adjusted. It will be interesting to see if this can be adapted to detect children left behind in a parked vehicle, much like the system Toyota is working on.\nReady Display\nThe Ready Display may look like it was lifted out of a Mercedes EQS, but it's a rather neat piece of kit. Powered by Samsung Neo QLED, the display quality is sublime. OEMs will be pleased to know it's an affordable solution with impressive performance.\nThere are various sizes (NQ3, NQ5, and NQ7) to choose from, with the largest stretching across the entire dashboard. To prevent the driver from getting a peek at the passenger side screen, the Ready Display uses software-enabled Active Privacy that keeps the passenger's display out of sight.\nAn under-display driver monitoring camera system (presumably the Ready Care Driver Activity Detection) is located beneath the screen.\nReady Connect\nReady Connect is Harman's latest 5G telematics control unit. The company says this enables OEMs to improve product scalability and upgradability and enhances in-vehicle-connected mobility experiences. Described as \"future-proof,\" manufacturers can upgrade from 4G to 5G with highly scalable software architecture.\nWith the help of Traffic Technology Services, Ready Connect allows for the display of real-time traffic information, like traffic light awareness, without the need for in-vehicle or roadside sensors.\nSeatSonic\nLastly, we have SeatSonic, which takes a new approach to in-vehicle audio systems. Instead of placing the speakers in traditional places - doors, dashboards, and footwells - SeatSonic provides occupants with a personalized listening experience.\nEach passenger benefits from a personal sound subsystem that offers a high-quality listening experience. While many manufacturers have integrated speakers into the headrests, seats tend not to act as sound systems. By freeing up space in other parts of the interior, designers can create more storage space or do something else with the once-occupied areas.\nSeatSonic can be specified as a standalone product or bundled with other functions, like SeatSonic Plus and SeatSonic Max. Harman is working with Adient, a leading figure in automotive seat design, to create these unique experiences for future vehicles."

In addition, HARMAN is also introducing SeatSonic, a new approach to in-car audio systems designed from the seat out that delivers exceptional audio performance while reducing system complexity and energy consumption. Each new product can work independently to deliver specific benefits or can be integrated for an even more enhanced experience. And, because they are from HARMAN, each product is designed to meet the rigorous demands and standards of the automotive environment \u2014 a value proposition that HARMAN calls 'Consumer Experiences. Automotive Grade.\u2019\n\u201cHARMAN Automotive products live at the intersection of consumer demand, technological advancements, and our uncompromising drive to transform the in-cabin experience in the most meaningful ways,\u201d notes Armin Prommersberger, Senior Vice President of Automotive Product Management, HARMAN International. \u201cOur focus on partnerships to access a broad spectrum of content and capabilities combined with delivering the right products at tech company speed enables OEMs to stay current with what their customers want \u2014 the newest experiences that make every drive safer and easier. As part of Samsung, one of the world\u2019s most respected consumer electronics companies, we aspire to make the vehicle a seamless extension of consumers\u2019 connected lifestyles, for as long as they choose to keep it on the road.\u201d\nAt CES 2024 HARMAN is introducing more than a dozen new products that deliver rich, relevant consumer experiences across the entire vehicle ecosystem, including:\nReady Vision QVUE & AR HUD: Transforming the windshield with pillar-to-pillar projection to bridge the physical and digital worlds\nReady Vision seamlessly integrates the most important visual needs for consumers, creating a safer and more informed driving experience that helps keep the driver\u2019s eyes and mind on the road. The new Ready Vision QVUE delivers an unprecedented experience with outstanding visual performance and unrivaled packaging. It provides the right information in the right place for minimized distraction and maximized engagement, bright illumination in all light conditions along with size and feature-set flexibility. Ready Vision QVUE concisely delivers the information most important to the driver \u2014 like mileage, speed, driving stats and alerts \u2014 on the lower portion of the windshield, allowing for easy readability without obstructing their view of the road, while also offering a large field of view for all vehicle occupants. This cost-effective HDR-capable reflective display powered by Samsung Neo QLED offers exceptional high-resolution display quality with vivid colors and brilliant optics. Through partnerships with leading third-party applications via the HARMAN Ignite Store, consumers can receive key information including low charge status alerts from ChargePoint and severe weather alerts via The Weather Channel in the QVUE display. For OEMs, QVUE offers modularity and scalability with different display sizes, from a single cluster replacement unit to full pillar-to-pillar coverage. The Ready Vision AR HUD is highly flexible, and provides superior performance combined with a unique and space-saving wedgeless design. The Ready Vision AR software is hardware and navigation agnostic, and adds 3-dimensional object detection with multi-sensor fusion for accurate positioning with low-latency. The Ready Vision augmented reality software incorporates artificial intelligence, combining depth perception with real-time visuals such as traffic, 3D navigation, and hazard alerts to increase the driver\u2019s situational awareness. Additionally, through partnerships with ChargePoint and Mavi.io OnMyWayTM Commerce, the AR HUD provides turn-by-turn navigation to EV charging stations and order purchasing and pick-up from restaurants.\nReady Upgrade Base and Advanced: Product-grade domain controllers, software, accessories and tools to reduce time to market and cost by upgradability\nReady Upgrade can take OEMs to market in as quickly as 6 months with a product built for re-usability across vehicle lines and model years. To enable hardware and software upgrades throughout the lifecycle of the vehicle, keeping the in-cabin experience as modern as possible and elevating vehicle sustainability, HARMAN is now offering two new Ready Upgrade domain controllers with unmatched cost and time to market, future proof technology and consumer-electronics-like cycles with seamless upgradability. The new Pre-Certified IP69 Base Domain Controllers are aimed at utility and adventure vehicles, targeting a whole new set of customers. Built for rugged environments, Ready Upgrade Base offers a dynamic combined in-vehicle infotainment and cluster experience on a single display. This enables users to choose their viewing preference on the attached 8\" display. Multi-user communications, such as sharing songs and intercom conversations, are unlocked with dual Bluetooth connections between driver and passenger helmets. The new Advanced Domain Controllers are optimized for premium line vehicles and OEMs that want to power more displays and add safety features and connected services in the car. The Advanced Domain Controller leverages the new Samsung Exynos processors to deliver premium in-cabin experiences and introduces the ability to access new features and services on demand through the HARMAN Ignite Store and third-party apps. Additionally, for the Advanced Domain Controller, HARMAN is collaborating with TE Connectivity to enable easier upgradability between hardware generations, utilizing their NET-AX+ modular hybrid connector.\nReady Care Driver Activity Detection & Life Presence Detection: Safety and well-being through cognitive load detection and closed-loop interventions, using artificial intelligence and neuroscience\nReady Care is an industry-first in-cabin monitoring product that measures a driver\u2019s visual and cognitive load in real-time to identify when distractions or potential drowsiness arise, and then offers tailored intervention strategies to enhance safety. The visual and mental cognitive-load-measurement uses neuroscience, artificial intelligence and machine learning to classify a driver\u2019s behavior into a focused versus distracted state. HARMAN-designed sensors in Ready Care provide crucial information about the vehicle\u2019s occupants and initiate personalized interventions for maintaining eyes, mind and safety on the road. Ready Care now offers Driver Activity Detection, identifying if a driver\u2019s hands are on the steering wheel and detecting other activities, such as eating and smoking, in real-time to ensure the driver has control of the vehicle. An interior-mounted radar sensor provides Life and Child Presence Detection which distinguishes between adult and child occupants in the vehicle as well as occupant position \u2014 critical for proper deployment of safety features like seatbelts and airbags. HARMAN is working closely with Samsung to further develop vital- and stress-sensing technology, while also collaborating with Gentherm, the global leader in thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for the automotive industry, and Adient, a global leader in automotive seating, to sense driver drowsiness and vitals in driving scenarios and deliver personalized closed-loop in-cabin interventions to return drivers back to a more optimal state behind the wheel.\nReady Display: The only Automotive display solution powered by Samsung Neo QLED\nWith Ready Display, HARMAN continues to close the consumer experience gap between in-home and in-cabin. Ready Display provides OLED visual quality at an affordable cost, stunning visual performance powered by Samsung Neo QLED and elegant, slim packaging. Building on the successful introduction of the industry\u2019s first automotive-grade cadmium-free Quantum Dot film and Mini LED backlight technology at CES 2023, this year we introduce new Ready Display product lines NQ3, NQ5, and NQ7 to deliver an aspirational viewing experience at accessible price points and performance levels. These range from HD to UHD displays, including the availability of curved displays, that meet consumer demands for larger in-cabin screens and OEM designers\u2019 demand for seamless dashboard integration. The various sizes can be mixed and matched to provide a wide range of viewing areas that can span pillar-to-pillar. New software-enabled Active Privacy minimizes driver distraction by keeping the contents of the available passenger display screen for the passenger's eyes only when needed. A new under-display driver monitoring camera system is discreetly integrated for an uninterrupted design. With new technology updates in 2024 like QSCAPE, which provides the capability to cohesively integrate HARMAN\u2019s unique UX across multiple screens and sizes, using a single, expansive glass cover for an elegant pillar-to-pillar aesthetic, Ready Display meets the display expectations consumers are accustomed to in their homes and delivers them right into their vehicles.\nReady Connect: A portfolio of telematics control units designed to maximize upgradability, scalability and usability\nHARMAN delivers a new era of 5G telematics control units (TCUs) with Ready Connect, the latest addition to its expanding portfolio of products. Ready Connect enables product upgradability, increases product scalability and transforms usability, improving in-vehicle connected mobility experiences focused on entertainment, productivity and enhanced situational awareness. It provides OEMs with a futureproof solution, via modular hardware upgradability from 4G to 5G with a highly scalable software architecture to maximize software reuse across product variants. Ready Connect comes with configurable features and built-in antennas developed in collaboration with Samsung to provide maximum connectivity performance and minimize cable and signal loss, saving additional cost and weight. In collaboration with Traffic Technology Services (TTS), the leading commercially available content aggregation prediction platform for connected safety and mobility solutions at intersections in United States and Europe, Ready Connect enables the display of real-time traffic information pertinent to a driver\u2019s route, such as traffic light awareness, without having to rely on roadside or in-vehicle sensors.\nSeatSonic: Scalable seat-based and passenger-centric audio system designed from the seat out\nSeatSonic offers a new approach to traditional in-cabin audio system architecture, moving speakers from conventional locations like doors, trunks and trim panels into the seats and putting users at the center of a high-quality, personalized listening experience. SeatSonic\u2019s user-centric approach delivers a personal sound subsystem for every passenger that is flexible, lightweight and energy-saving while freeing up space in critical spots for trim designers. The product is a combination of specifically designed near-field transducers integrated for both acoustic performance and safety in the headrest. Added to this is a proprietary bass unit in the lumbar section of the seat to provide a multi-modal experience that you both hear and feel. SeatSonic is available as a standalone product or can be combined with partner features and/or other HARMAN products to create a holistic offering, such as in SeatSonic Plus which includes WellSenseTM by Gentherm, and in SeatSonic Max which includes WellSenseTM by Gentherm, HARMAN Ready Care and a branded audio package. To bring SeatSonic to life, HARMAN is working with Adient, a global leader in automotive seating, to bring a vast array of these personalized experiences to the car.\nHARMAN is showcasing its portfolio of new and expanded products together with its industry partners who share the commitment to bring the experienced consumers demand to the car, today.\nEach of these products will be on display as HARMAN returns to the Las Vegas Convention Center (Central Hall, Booth #19629) during CES 2024.

View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108534256/en/\n(Photo: Business Wire)\nNew entries in the line-up of award-winning HARMAN Ready products deliver the right information at the right time in the right place and enable fast, seamless hardware and software upgrades that prepare vehicles for today and tomorrow. In addition, HARMAN is also introducing SeatSonic, a new approach to in-car audio systems designed from the seat out that delivers exceptional audio performance while reducing system complexity and energy consumption. Each new product can work independently to deliver specific benefits or can be integrated for an even more enhanced experience. And, because they are from HARMAN, each product is designed to meet the rigorous demands and standards of the automotive environment \u2014 a value proposition that HARMAN calls 'Consumer Experiences. Automotive Grade.\u2019\n\u201cHARMAN Automotive products live at the intersection of consumer demand, technological advancements, and our uncompromising drive to transform the in-cabin experience in the most meaningful ways,\u201d notes Armin Prommersberger, Senior Vice President of Automotive Product Management, HARMAN International. \u201cOur focus on partnerships to access a broad spectrum of content and capabilities combined with delivering the right products at tech company speed enables OEMs to stay current with what their customers want \u2014 the newest experiences that make every drive safer and easier. As part of Samsung, one of the world\u2019s most respected consumer electronics companies, we aspire to make the vehicle a seamless extension of consumers\u2019 connected lifestyles, for as long as they choose to keep it on the road.\u201d\nAt CES 2024 HARMAN is introducing more than a dozen new products that deliver rich, relevant consumer experiences across the entire vehicle ecosystem, including:\nReady Vision QVUE & AR HUD: Transforming the windshield with pillar-to-pillar projection to bridge the physical and digital worlds\nReady Vision seamlessly integrates the most important visual needs for consumers, creating a safer and more informed driving experience that helps keep the driver\u2019s eyes and mind on the road. The new Ready Vision QVUE delivers an unprecedented experience with outstanding visual performance and unrivaled packaging. It provides the right information in the right place for minimized distraction and maximized engagement, bright illumination in all light conditions along with size and feature-set flexibility. Ready Vision QVUE concisely delivers the information most important to the driver \u2014 like mileage, speed, driving stats and alerts \u2014 on the lower portion of the windshield, allowing for easy readability without obstructing their view of the road, while also offering a large field of view for all vehicle occupants. This cost-effective HDR-capable reflective display powered by Samsung Neo QLED offers exceptional high-resolution display quality with vivid colors and brilliant optics. Through partnerships with leading third-party applications via the HARMAN Ignite Store, consumers can receive key information including low charge status alerts from ChargePoint and severe weather alerts via The Weather Channel in the QVUE display. For OEMs, QVUE offers modularity and scalability with different display sizes, from a single cluster replacement unit to full pillar-to-pillar coverage. The Ready Vision AR HUD is highly flexible, and provides superior performance combined with a unique and space-saving wedgeless design. The Ready Vision AR software is hardware and navigation agnostic, and adds 3-dimensional object detection with multi-sensor fusion for accurate positioning with low-latency. The Ready Vision augmented reality software incorporates artificial intelligence, combining depth perception with real-time visuals such as traffic, 3D navigation, and hazard alerts to increase the driver\u2019s situational awareness. Additionally, through partnerships with ChargePoint and Mavi.io OnMyWayTM Commerce, the AR HUD provides turn-by-turn navigation to EV charging stations and order purchasing and pick-up from restaurants.\nReady Upgrade Base and Advanced: Product-grade domain controllers, software, accessories and tools to reduce time to market and cost by upgradability\nReady Upgrade can take OEMs to market in as quickly as 6 months with a product built for re-usability across vehicle lines and model years. To enable hardware and software upgrades throughout the lifecycle of the vehicle, keeping the in-cabin experience as modern as possible and elevating vehicle sustainability, HARMAN is now offering two new Ready Upgrade domain controllers with unmatched cost and time to market, future proof technology and consumer-electronics-like cycles with seamless upgradability. The new Pre-Certified IP69 Base Domain Controllers are aimed at utility and adventure vehicles, targeting a whole new set of customers. Built for rugged environments, Ready Upgrade Base offers a dynamic combined in-vehicle infotainment and cluster experience on a single display. This enables users to choose their viewing preference on the attached 8\" display. Multi-user communications, such as sharing songs and intercom conversations, are unlocked with dual Bluetooth connections between driver and passenger helmets. The new Advanced Domain Controllers are optimized for premium line vehicles and OEMs that want to power more displays and add safety features and connected services in the car. The Advanced Domain Controller leverages the new Samsung Exynos processors to deliver premium in-cabin experiences and introduces the ability to access new features and services on demand through the HARMAN Ignite Store and third-party apps. Additionally, for the Advanced Domain Controller, HARMAN is collaborating with TE Connectivity to enable easier upgradability between hardware generations, utilizing their NET-AX+ modular hybrid connector.\nReady Care Driver Activity Detection & Life Presence Detection: Safety and well-being through cognitive load detection and closed-loop interventions, using artificial intelligence and neuroscience\nReady Care is an industry-first in-cabin monitoring product that measures a driver\u2019s visual and cognitive load in real-time to identify when distractions or potential drowsiness arise, and then offers tailored intervention strategies to enhance safety. The visual and mental cognitive-load-measurement uses neuroscience, artificial intelligence and machine learning to classify a driver\u2019s behavior into a focused versus distracted state. HARMAN-designed sensors in Ready Care provide crucial information about the vehicle\u2019s occupants and initiate personalized interventions for maintaining eyes, mind and safety on the road. Ready Care now offers Driver Activity Detection, identifying if a driver\u2019s hands are on the steering wheel and detecting other activities, such as eating and smoking, in real-time to ensure the driver has control of the vehicle. An interior-mounted radar sensor provides Life and Child Presence Detection which distinguishes between adult and child occupants in the vehicle as well as occupant position \u2014 critical for proper deployment of safety features like seatbelts and airbags. HARMAN is working closely with Samsung to further develop vital- and stress-sensing technology, while also collaborating with Gentherm, the global leader in thermal management and pneumatic comfort technologies for the automotive industry, and Adient, a global leader in automotive seating, to sense driver drowsiness and vitals in driving scenarios and deliver personalized closed-loop in-cabin interventions to return drivers back to a more optimal state behind the wheel.\nReady Display: The only Automotive display solution powered by Samsung Neo QLED\nWith Ready Display, HARMAN continues to close the consumer experience gap between in-home and in-cabin. Ready Display provides OLED visual quality at an affordable cost, stunning visual performance powered by Samsung Neo QLED and elegant, slim packaging. Building on the successful introduction of the industry\u2019s first automotive-grade cadmium-free Quantum Dot film and Mini LED backlight technology at CES 2023, this year we introduce new Ready Display product lines NQ3, NQ5, and NQ7 to deliver an aspirational viewing experience at accessible price points and performance levels. These range from HD to UHD displays, including the availability of curved displays, that meet consumer demands for larger in-cabin screens and OEM designers\u2019 demand for seamless dashboard integration. The various sizes can be mixed and matched to provide a wide range of viewing areas that can span pillar-to-pillar. New software-enabled Active Privacy minimizes driver distraction by keeping the contents of the available passenger display screen for the passenger's eyes only when needed. A new under-display driver monitoring camera system is discreetly integrated for an uninterrupted design. With new technology updates in 2024 like QSCAPE, which provides the capability to cohesively integrate HARMAN\u2019s unique UX across multiple screens and sizes, using a single, expansive glass cover for an elegant pillar-to-pillar aesthetic, Ready Display meets the display expectations consumers are accustomed to in their homes and delivers them right into their vehicles.\nReady Connect: A portfolio of telematics control units designed to maximize upgradability, scalability and usability\nHARMAN delivers a new era of 5G telematics control units (TCUs) with Ready Connect, the latest addition to its expanding portfolio of products. Ready Connect enables product upgradability, increases product scalability and transforms usability, improving in-vehicle connected mobility experiences focused on entertainment, productivity and enhanced situational awareness. It provides OEMs with a futureproof solution, via modular hardware upgradability from 4G to 5G with a highly scalable software architecture to maximize software reuse across product variants. Ready Connect comes with configurable features and built-in antennas developed in collaboration with Samsung to provide maximum connectivity performance and minimize cable and signal loss, saving additional cost and weight. In collaboration with Traffic Technology Services (TTS), the leading commercially available content aggregation prediction platform for connected safety and mobility solutions at intersections in United States and Europe, Ready Connect enables the display of real-time traffic information pertinent to a driver\u2019s route, such as traffic light awareness, without having to rely on roadside or in-vehicle sensors.\nSeatSonic: Scalable seat-based and passenger-centric audio system designed from the seat out\nSeatSonic offers a new approach to traditional in-cabin audio system architecture, moving speakers from conventional locations like doors, trunks and trim panels into the seats and putting users at the center of a high-quality, personalized listening experience. SeatSonic\u2019s user-centric approach delivers a personal sound subsystem for every passenger that is flexible, lightweight and energy-saving while freeing up space in critical spots for trim designers. The product is a combination of specifically designed near-field transducers integrated for both acoustic performance and safety in the headrest. Added to this is a proprietary bass unit in the lumbar section of the seat to provide a multi-modal experience that you both hear and feel. SeatSonic is available as a standalone product or can be combined with partner features and/or other HARMAN products to create a holistic offering, such as in SeatSonic Plus which includes WellSenseTM by Gentherm, and in SeatSonic Max which includes WellSenseTM by Gentherm, HARMAN Ready Care and a branded audio package. To bring SeatSonic to life, HARMAN is working with Adient, a global leader in automotive seating, to bring a vast array of these personalized experiences to the car.\nHARMAN is showcasing its portfolio of new and expanded products together with its industry partners who share the commitment to bring the experienced consumers demand to the car, today.\nEach of these products will be on display as HARMAN returns to the Las Vegas Convention Center (Central Hall, Booth #19629) during CES 2024.

It\u2019s a natural partnership, and it\u2019s been immensely gratifying to see our 3,000 U.S. employees working hand-in-hand to bring incredible innovations to fruition.\nHARMAN\u2019s deep roots in the automotive industry coupled with Samsung\u2019s scale, global platform and consumer electronics prowess provide the know-how and power to accelerate the connected car movement. Together, we are providing the full spectrum of automotive technologies, including audio and video products, as well as the hardware and software solutions needed to power next-generation automotive systems.\nIn the past year, we\u2019ve made amazing strides to bring us closer to the transportation of the future than ever before. For instance, Samsung has been paving the way for 5G for many years, leveraging its deep expertise in networks, chips and hardware solutions. Combined with HARMAN\u2019S automotive knowledge, we are positioned to be one of the first companies prepared to integrate 5G into the connected car. That\u2019s why one of the first initiatives we launched\u00a0as partners was a Strategic Business Unit dedicated to developing key technologies for safer, smarter, connected cars.\nSafety, of course, is a top priority for us as we work towards a tech-forward but consumer-friendly and secure product offering. For example, at CES this year, we debuted the industry\u2019s first 5G-ready telematics platform\u00a0that allows cars to communicate directly with objects outside the vehicle such as traffic lights and other cars.The platform works effectively because of Samsung\u2019s 5G solution working hand in hand with HARMAN\u2019s expertise in making automotive grade systems and our industry-leading Over-The-Air (OTA) and cyber security solutions.\n5G-ready telematics platform\nAlso at CES, we launched the connected cockpit dashboard which converts the traditional dash of a car into a customizable, seamless instrument panel providing infotainment and IoT services across multiple displays. HARMAN\u2019s engineering streamlines the disparate operating systems within a car, and coupled with Samsung\u2019s consumer tech and sleek product design, we\u2019ve created a beautiful, functional and scalable experience for drivers and passengers.\nLikewise, at Mobile World Congress, Samsung and HARMAN announced that we will build and provide complete, secure, end-to-end solutions using the Samsung ARTIK Smart IoT platform for areas such as manufacturing, healthcare, smart cities, smart homes and smart buildings. We also recently have announced an engineering partnership with Samsung SmartThings, the industry leader for consumer IoT technology and the easiest way for people to turn any traditional home into a smart home with interoperating sensors, smart devices and a native mobile application. With the help of HARMAN\u2019s Connected Services software development team, based in Mountain View, California, this will accelerate SmartThings product and app development. In HARMAN\u2019s Professional Solutions business, headquartered in Northridge, California, we are bringing the best of video and audio together for the ultimate cinematic experience. And in consumer electronics, we are bundling HARMAN\u2019s AKG offerings with Samsung\u2019s mobile devices.

        "raw_content": "Empowering display industry professionals with cutting-edge insights and analysis\nSamsung\u2019s Ultimate CES 2024 Pitch: We Know Semiconductor Display Tech Better Than Anybody\nAt CES 2024, Samsung introduced a series of innovative technologies, aligning with their \u201cAI for All\u201d vision, whatever that meant. If you wanted a marketing job at CES, apparently the first question they ask you is, what are your favorite letters of the alphabet?\n\u201cHmm, A and I, I think.\u201d\n\u201cYou got the job, congratulations!\u201d\nIt\u2019s a shame that Samsung didn\u2019t choose to make it all about the Displays for All. Because the standout for Samsung at CES 2024 was its showing of a world first transparent MicroLED. There was a robot dog, Braille, an updated version of a previous model that I knew nothing about and didn\u2019t really care much about. And some sort of chatbot called Gauss, a soundbar, some appliances, and more interestingly, a new service called Now+. This service adds smart home controls to Samsung TVs. With Now+, you can control lights, air conditioners, and other devices from your TV. You can also use your phone as a TV remote. Another feature, Daily+, customizes your TV based on information from your SmartThings devices.\nSamsung TVs can now detect smartphones nearby and use them as remotes. A new SmartThings TV Quick Panel will appear for easy control of devices, viewing cameras, and finding your phone. The TV can also turn on automatically as you approach and show important information about your smart home devices, like camera feeds, temperature, and laundry cycle status. Samsung didn\u2019t provide much detail about when these features will be available, which TVs and devices are compatible, and if you need a Samsung smartphone for the remote control feature. They did mention that SmartThings is compatible with the Matter standard, meaning many connected appliances should work with it. But I guess you could call all of Now+ display related, too.\nI don\u2019t think Samsung was giving away any trade secrets or delivering a kick-ass plan for 2024 success, but what it was sending out a message, one that was pretty much a flex of muscle and power. There\u2019s no other way to explain the extent of the technological display that it put forward. It\u2019s hard to think that any of the MicroLED products shown are feasibly 2024 or 2025 products but if they were meant to be demonstrations of power and reach, they hit the mark. It was pretty arrogant but in that way that a very big powerful corporation can be.\nCould it also be fear? There is always that to consider, the thought that Samsung is stomping its feet and puffing up its chest to say, Hey, we got this tech beat and will own it in a few years time. MicroLED, and semiconductor displays in general, are not existential threats to traditional glass display manufacturers, like Samsung, which has enormous investments in fabs to that effect.\nThe boss likes to give us these projected roadmaps on the deployment of MicroLED, and looking into the future, when we will start to see significant volumes, but it all seems artificial, a timeline to meet the investment criteria of traditional display manufacturers and their need to recoup their investment in factories that cost them billions and billions. In other words, are the major display manufacturers holding back our future display technologies.\nYou wouldn\u2019t have thought so looking at Samsung\u2019s booth but it also seemed like the company was saying, We\u2019ll tell you when its time for MicroLED and we\u2019ll tell you how it gets to the mass market. That\u2019s my takeaway from the Samsung booth. And yes, when I asked them for more information or help, they were not very nice to me instead choosing to just push the crowds through the booth in a very methodical manner. That doesn\u2019t bother me, but it did color my thoughts on what was really going on with the presentation.\nAI for All\nIn the spirit of fairness, Jong-Hee (JH) Han, Vice Chairman and CEO of Samsung\u2019s Device eXperience (DX) Division, did give a presentation, with other executives at CES 2024, and there were some highlights which should go on the record:\nI have to conclude by saying that Samsung had the big presence at this show and it had the biggest presence of all the display vendors. I wasn\u2019t being cynical when I said this was a shot across the bow of the industry, just realistic. The company was flexing and doing it well. You can almost see the double bicep pose on the podium (if you don\u2019t know what that is, just look up Arnold + double bicep pose or, better yet, ask AI).\nRelated Posts\nSamsung\u2019s Ultimate CES 2024 Pitch: We Know Semiconductor Display Tech Better Than Anybody\nEmory Kale\nScrona\u2019s EHD Printing Comes Together With Avantama\u2019s MicroLED Materials\nOmid Rahmat\nSelling TVs to Future Generations\nOmid Rahmat\nEnnostar Announces Sale of Zhunan MicroLED Plant for $21M\nEmory Kale\nJon Peddie Research4 St. Gabrielle Ct.Tiburon, California 94920\n415-435-9368\n\u00a9 2024 Jon Peddie Research\nAbout us | Privacy Policy | terms of service | contact"

Supernal is a part of the Hyundai Motor Group. (AP Photo/John Locher, File)\nCES provides an annual insight into where and how cutting-edge innovations will reshape how people work, study, communicate and, in many cases, how they\u2019ll drive. This year CES saw a number of automakers present concept vehicles that seem both years into the future and on the very cusp of production.\nFrom flying vehicles and AI-powered voice assistants to the latest in EVs, CES 2024 offers a peek into what you\u2019ll be driving \u2014 or what might be driving you \u2014 in the years ahead. The automotive experts at Edmunds have rounded up some of this year\u2019s most notable automotive debuts.\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMES TO YOUR CAR\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is poised to reshape countless aspects of daily life. While there are plenty of concerns and opportunities involved, it\u2019s clear that automakers will be moving ahead to use AI for what they hope will be a more helpful and optimistic driving future.\nMercedes-Benz, for its part, debuted its next-generation AI virtual assistant software. The upcoming version of Mercedes\u2019 MBUX infotainment interface, dubbed MB.OS, will feature conversational voice commands and far more nuanced responses. For example, by monitoring voice instructions and driving behavior, the AI system can determine if a driver is hurried and stressed or cruising along carefree. A version of MB.OS is set to debut in Mercedes\u2019 upcoming electric-powered CLA sedan.\nAnother German automaker, Volkswagen, says it will integrate ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot, into its vehicles to provide more voice interaction beyond what\u2019s currently available. For example, the car\u2019s existing voice command features will work for things like navigation, climate control or general knowledge requests. But something it can\u2019t handle will be forwarded anonymously to ChatGPT. ChatGPT will then respond in a seamless Volkswagen voice and style. For now, Volkswagen has not said when this functionality will be available on its vehicles sold in the United States.\nHONDA\u2019S HEADED BACK TO THE FUTURE\nReliable, efficient and out-of-this-world wild. Which one of these descriptors is not often attributed to the practically minded Honda Motor Co.? In the near future, all of them look to apply to Honda\u2019s upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, dubbed the 0 Series. Taking design cues from seemingly everything from a ground-hugging sports car to a 1980s-era Dustbuster vacuum cleaner, the Honda Saloon concept vehicle is a hint at the Japanese automaker\u2019s EV strategy and upcoming designs.\nWith its wedge-shaped body, truncated tail and upward-swinging doors, the Honda Saloon is a head-turning sedan that hints at a production model due in 2026. It will also debut the latest in EV technology, such as a more efficient and longer-lasting battery pack. Just don\u2019t expect that the Saloon\u2019s glowing front grille, gullwing doors and yoke-style steering wheel are all part of the finished product.\nELECTRIC FLYING CARS PROMISE TO BECOME REALITY\nFlying cars seem like something straight out of a science fiction movie, yet they were very much in the here and now at CES 2024. One of the most head-turning is the eVTOL Flying Car created by Chinese automaker XPeng. Equal parts low-lying supercar and high-flying helicopter, this wedge-shaped concept is wildly futuristic and entirely electric powered.\nNotably, the company\u2019s concept isn\u2019t a flying car in the traditional sense. It doesn\u2019t have wings and uses its electrically powered fans to produce lift and fly straight up. It can theoretically take off and land anywhere there\u2019s room, making travel as a sort of gridlock-avoiding city vehicle more likely.\nAnother electric helicopter-like entry at the show was the Supernal S-A2. Supernal is notable for being an offshoot of Hyundai. The connection to the giant South Korean automaker certainly adds some plausibility to the S-A2 turning into reality. The S-A2\u2019s specs aren\u2019t mind-boggling, with a maximum range of just 25-40 miles, but that might be all you need for an aerial taxi.\nSupernal says it hopes the S-A2 will be a production reality by 2028. Still, don\u2019t get your hopes up too much that your daily commute is about to take flight. Wait-and-see is the best approach as other vital details such as price and success overcoming regulatory hurdles all remain very much up in the air.\n_______\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nNick Kurczewski is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Twitter and Instagram\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.
