Both devices have attracted great attention from the media, as well as visits (and try-outs) from some of the top VR influencers of the world.\nThe Pimax Crystal is Pimax's third generation VR headset, after Pimax's 5K in 2017, and the 8K in 2018. The Crystal is the first PCVR and standalone dual-mode VR headset. It provides a 2880 x 2880 pixels per eye, at a maximum refresh rate of 160Hz. It has 6 cameras, 4 outside to track hand and body movements, and 2 inside to track eyes and face. Alongside eye-tracking, it also comes with auto-IPD.\nMore importantly, Crystal is the first VR product ever to support interchangeable lenses. With no image distortion, the maximum pixel density can be 42PPD, which is the highest PPD known in VR headsets. It has local dimming to further improve visual performance and has already been dubbed 'The King of Clarity' for its stunning visual performance.\nComparison by Unbound VR\nThe Portal is a revolutionary hybrid multifunctional metaverse product. It's a completely new type of device, making it a perfect fit among many other innovations unveiled at CES. Portal is built for users with multi-scene gaming demands. In recent years, VR games have become popular, but none of the products can really meet the needs of users for multi-scenario applications. The Portal integrates four functions - console, VR, portable PC, and living room entertainment hub.\nQuotes from visitors:\nIan Carlos Campbell from Inverse: \"I was skeptical of the Portal, but after trying the odd Android handheld and virtual reality headset hybrid at CES 2023, I can confirm that Pimax's do-it-all machine really does work.\"\nHarry (Skeeva) Skigis: \"The Pimax Crystal had the clearest picture I've seen in VR to date! Absolutely stunning visuals.\"\nFrom Pimax's ongoing Kickstarter to its booth at CES2023, the innovative spirit of Pimax has attracted countless fans to try out these new products, but it's also a great way to meet the consumers that make all this change possible.\nFor questions about product demos, custom images, or gaming footage on either the Crystal or the Portal, please contact:\nPimax created the world's first 4K VR headset in 2015 that was recognized as the best VR product in CES Asia 2016, released the award-winning Pimax 5K+ in 2017, and the flagship 8KX headset that won Best VR product at CES Las Vegas in 2020.

The Pimax Crystal is also the only headset product in the XR category to be actually available for purchase (now with a Black Friday discount).\nThe world's first VR headset with glass lenses\nThe Pimax Crystal currently offers the highest clarity in consumer VR.

These lenses are a key factor in why the headset is aptly named the 'Crystal.'\nPimax has independently developed a world-leading optical system for VR, integrating multi-parametric optimization with the unique characteristics of the QLED+miniLED display screen. This system is enhanced by specialized optical techniques designed to suppress stray light and correct distortion. These design elements work together to maximize the intrinsic resolution power of the aspheric lens and fully leverage the ultra-high light transmittance of the optical-grade glass material to ensure that the final visual output delivers an exceptional viewing experience with edge-to-edge crystal-like clarity, vivid contrasts, and high brightness.\nDemo at CES 2024\nThe Pimax Crystal will be on display and available to demo for all visitors at CES 2024 (#15454), as well as be displayed at the official Innovation Awards Showcase at the Venetian Expo, Halls D, Booth #56332.

This system is enhanced by specialized optical techniques designed to suppress stray light and correct distortion. These design elements work together to maximize the intrinsic resolution power of the aspheric lens and fully leverage the ultra-high light transmittance of the optical-grade glass material to ensure that the final visual output delivers an exceptional viewing experience with edge-to-edge crystal-like clarity, vivid contrasts, and high brightness.\nPimax glass lens\nDemo at CES 2024\nThe Pimax Crystal will be on display and available to demo for all visitors at CES 2024 (#15454), as well as be displayed at the official Innovation Awards Showcase at the Venetian Expo, Halls D, Booth #56332.
