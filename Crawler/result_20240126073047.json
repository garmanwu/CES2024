Eye tracking is poised to serve as a critical technology for enhancing C2 capabilities in XR environments, optimizing training and cognitive monitoring for enabling real-time adaptive systems. However, current eye tracking technologies do not have form factors which can operate in rugged, highly mobile army environments and the precision necessary to enable necessary capabilities. A contact lens form factor would allow for operational integration into multiple wartime dynamic scenarios for joint mission precision to include manned and unmanned air operations and ground vehicle systems. DESCRIPTION: Camera-based eye tracking technology lacks precision, manufacturability, and sustainment for high tempo and mobile operations. Current high precision eye trackers require minimal changes in head position, pupil size, and ambient lighting for valid data and only enable static operational scenarios. Contact lens-based eye tracking can measure movement of the eye itself thereby avoiding complex and noisy image processing algorithms that traditional high precision eye tracking systems rely on and have a form factor that is acceptable for mission demands. Ground Vehicle System Center (GVSC) has a concept for using the contact lens in mounted individuals as a controller in a multilayered XR User Interface (UI) for Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs) where instead of using a physical controller or gesture recognition, the eyes can serve to select virtual objects in the environment. Here soldiers would not rely on traditional physical buttons or controllers to interact and could rely on their eyes thereby increasing the speed and intuitive nature of interacting with HMD interfaces. PHASE I: Feasibility studies for eye tracking system and sensors embedded in contact lens. PHASE II: Working prototype of testbed and sensors which can collect binocular eye gaze position, pupil size, and blinks and comparison to gold standard high precision eye trackers. Phase II Sequential: Human factors feasibility studies and soldier touchpoints. PHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: \u2022 Academic research focuses namely on general eye tracking use cases with little emphasis put on the contact lens submarket. Fabrication of smart lenses has stymied companies, however, 3D printing has shown early signs of circumventing current roadblocks. \u2022 Data leverages numerous enabling technologies, ranging from semiconductors, microLED displays, sensors, and RF/Non-RF bandwidth vehicles to transfer data. \u2022 Current market applications, including start-up usage, for smart contact lenses include: o Eye disease, blood pressure and glucose monitoring, and other health issues. o Supplanting smartphones from app usage to music playback o The ability to see in multiple different environments, like the dark, that would otherwise obstruct vision.

Terrain-shaping operations also help the mobility and survivability of friendly forces. Currently, the Army uses cannon-fired or air-dropped anti-tank mines to shape the deep maneuver area of the battlefield, which is 70km+ beyond the FLOT. The systems the Army currently uses to conduct terrain-shaping operations, while still broadly effective, are aging and resource intensive to emplace. Additionally, while current US anti-personnel landmine policy does not prevent the use of cannon-fired or air-dropped anti-tank mines, the policy does restrict\u00a0 to the Korean peninsula the use of current systems using anti-personnel mines. This restriction prevents current systems from being a world-wide solution for terrain shaping.\nThe Army is seeking deep terrain shaping obstacles (DTSO) that will delay, deter, and deny enemy forces 70\u2013150km+ beyond the FLOT. DTSO solutions should delay operational maneuver through restricting terrain to defeat/destroy or to gain space/time, deny use of or access to key terrain/facilities, and deter operational movement of enemy forces. Technology solutions that contribute to one or more DTSO tasks are of particular interest. Solutions that will be considered, but not limited to, are the following:\nSolutions should allow Soldiers to conduct terrain-shaping operations 70km+ beyond the FLOT. This may include technology solutions that can be employed by air or ground uncrewed systems or launched from a safe distance. If the solution includes a lethal munition it must be able to classify an/or discriminate between types of targets.\nThe Army desires flexibility in future terrain shaping methods. Solutions should incorporate the ability to be controlled (activated/deactivated) from behind the frontline. However, solutions with the potential to be controlled from behind the frontline will be considered. Ideally, solutions should be scalable for use depending on the desired effect on enemy maneuver (disrupt, turn, fix, or block).\nPHASE I: Design a proof-of-concept solution or component(s) of a solution for terrain shaping in the deep fight (70\u2013150km+). Solutions may include uncrewed systems to impact enemy maneuver in the deep battlespace, integrating remote sensing and lethal effects with human-in-the-loop, or other components that facilitate successful terrain shaping in the deep fight. Proposals will be evaluated based on the contributions they can provide to the overall terrain shaping effort and the likelihood of the technology providing an effective solution. The objective of Phase I is to establish the technical merit, feasibility, and commercial potential of the proposed effort, and to determine the quality of performance of the awarded companies prior to providing further support in Phase II. The final deliverable will be a concept design presentation, optional proof of technology demonstration, and plans for follow-on Phase II work.\nCompanies selected for a Phase I award may voluntarily participate in the Army Applications Laboratory (AAL) 12-week cohort program. The AAL cohort program is designed to solve specific Army modernization challenges on a compressed timeline. The cohort program matches qualified companies with Army problem owners to speed capability development, accelerate transition, and de-risk or inform requirements. This program is designed for businesses that have unique, applicable technology and are interested in growing a new line of business through the DoD.\nThe cohort program will enhance technology development through rapid exposure to Army stakeholders and the Army maneuver support community. Planned activities include a problem topic deep dive, in-person exposure to current breaching techniques, and stakeholder engagement with requirements writers, acquisitions managers, and end users.

Phase II deliverables include a demonstration and delivery of a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 6 prototype for further Army evaluation, as well as quarterly and final reports detailing design and performance analysis of the prototype. Phase II proposals will be evaluated, in part, on cost reasonableness and speed of delivery of a TRL 6 prototype.\nAwardees may also be eligible for Phase IIb award after completion of Phase II period of performance. Phase IIb can extend the period of performance with additional funding and additional matching opportunities to finish building out solutions with the stakeholders\u2019 discretion.\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives through the effort. Companies may develop a manufacturing-ready product design, capable of integration with the existing or future system, and demonstrate technology integration. Low-rate production will occur as required. Companies will engage in laboratory or operational testing as required. Phase III deliverables include system-level integration technical data package, installation documentation, and system-level prototype for demonstration and government-sponsored testing.\nWEBINAR DATE:\nA webinar will be conducted for this solicitation on Friday, December 15, at 10:00am CT.

Most modern automotive and combat vehicles have transitioned from mechanically to electronically controlled transmissions which present the need to update testing methodologies and data processing techniques for the extrapolation of fluid temperature data in critical systems of military vehicles. Current extrapolation methods of critical component fluid temperature data were developed before electronically controlled transmissions were introduced and cannot be used for assessing these new types of transmissions, reference Test Operating Procedure (TOP) 2-2-604, Drawbar Pull, dated 26 September 2007. When testing a vehicle at temperatures below 120\u2109, derating features within electronically controlled drivetrains may not be triggered during testing and the true performance characteristics of the vehicle remain unreported. The intent is to modernize the test methodology and utilize synthetic data generation data processing techniques for Full Load Cooling (FLC) testing. The new test methodology and data processing techniques should accurately characterize the performance of the vehicle, when operating in environments at 120\u2109 even though testing is performed when the ambient temperature is below 120\u2109. Synthetically generated data should identify derating trigger points (engine governing/retarding, transmission shifting, etc.). and their effect on system\u2019s performance, even though these events would not have been experienced during the test event. The synthetically generated data should also identify the extrapolated critical component fluid temperature values.\nDESCRIPTION: The approach for this topic is innovative as it is leveraging commercial industry data and expertise about behaviors of electronically controlled powertrains. Electronically controlled powertrains have been widely used throughout the commercial automotive industry for more than 30 years. However, application of this technology to military vehicles is relatively novel and requires a knowledge transference to Department of Defense (DoD) testing experts as the \u201cthird-party\u201d evaluators of military equipment. A small business with experience assessing automotive powertrain and cooling systems will be able to develop a new FLC test methodology and mathematical formulae for advanced data processing techniques to appropriately assess vehicle powertrain performance in extreme natural environments across various military ground vehicles. Current automotive industry practice is vehicle specific assessments whereas there is not an agnostic model for predicting cooling system performance using test data. Testing for cooling system performance is anticipated to be more relevant for military vehicles due to increasing ambient environmental conditions due to climate change.\nPHASE I:\n4QFY24-3QFY25\nPHASE II:\n4QFY25-3QFY26\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS:\nREFERENCES:\nKEYWORDS: Combat Vehicles; Powertrains; Data Processing; Electronics; Testing; Methodology; Transmission; Automotive; Front Load Cooling (FLC); Drivetrains\nOUSD (R&E) CRITICAL TECHNOLOGY AREA(S): Biotechnology; Advanced Materials\nOBJECTIVE:\u00a0 The objective of this topic is to develop applied research toward an innovative capability to improve water surveillance at point-of-need.

The payload also must perform casualty evacuation (CASEVAC) with attachability to ground and air robotic/autonomous platforms.\nDESCRIPTION:\nCurrently, blood delivery, medical resupply, and CASEVAC are conducted by convoys of crewed vehicles. If transportation cannot reach the front line, units are unable to receive a blood/medical products or remove casualties for treatment for potentially life-threatening injuries. None of the Army\u2019s current systems offer a heavy-lift, modular mission payload that can autonomously resupply blood and perform CASEVAC.\nThe ability for blood resupply and transport of casualties is critical to the survival of Soldiers who sustain life-threatening injuries. Modular medical mission payloads will provide lifesaving capabilities to forward units by using robotic platforms.\nThe goal of this effort is the development of a medical multi-mission, modular payload that can be employed by robotic ground and air platforms.\nThese payloads should:\n* SEE REFERENCES SECTION FOR LINKS TO THESE RESOURCES *\nCost should be considered in the SBIR proposals.\nPHASE I:\nOnly Direct to Phase II (DP2) proposals will be accepted for this topic. DP2 proposals must provide documentation to substantiate that the scientific and technical merit and feasibility (listed in the following paragraph) are met, and the proposals must describe potential commercial applications of the solution. The provided documentation should contain all relevant information including, but not limited to, technical reports, test data, prototype designs/models, and performance goals/results.\nDP2 proposals should build on the design formulated according to Phase I requirements: Design a preliminary modular medical mission payload for employment via autonomous ground and air platform. Preliminary design should describe the physical payload, consist of a concept for storing climate-controlled blood products, and include a concept for integrating a casualty evacuation capability with remote patient monitoring.\nPHASE II:\nRefine the preliminary design developed from Phase I equivalent and create a Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5-6 modular medical mission payload. System refinement should include integration of the payload into both ground and air autonomous platforms. Required Phase II deliverables include the TRL 5-6 system and the components (hardware and software) necessary to integrate the payload into the platforms. The payload will be demonstrated at a vendor-provided, government-approved location to evaluate performance. The performer will provide the ground and air platform necessary to conduct the demonstration but is not required to deliver either platform to the government. Additionally, the performer will deliver monthly progress reports describing technical challenges, risk, and progress against the schedule. At the end of the period of performance, the performer will submit a final technical report.\nPHASE III:\nThe objective of Phase III, where appropriate, is for the small business to pursue commercialization objectives through the effort. Companies may develop a manufacturing-ready product design, capable of integration with the existing or future systems, and demonstrate technology integration. Low-rate production will occur as required. Companies will engage in laboratory or operational testing as required. Phase III deliverables include system-level integration technical data package, installation documentation, and system-level prototype for demonstration and government-sponsored testing.\nKEYWORDS:\nUAS, Unmanned Aerial Systems, UAV, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles, Medical Payloads, Resupply, CASEVAC, UGV, Unmanned Ground Vehicles, HVTOL\nREFERENCES:"

Where can one find information on other current and previous SETO funding opportunities?\nA. See current and previous SETO funding opportunities and information on previous SETO SBIR/STTR awards.\nQ.\u00a0Can you specify the expected benchmarks for price and performance improvements for the proposed solar technologies, and how these benchmarks are established?\nA. Review SETO\u2019s general goals and targets.\nQ.\u00a0What are the key differentiators that SETO is looking for in innovations compared to existing commercially available solar products or solutions; could you provide more details on the requirements for the preliminary cost analysis, especially regarding the assumptions and input data sources?\nA. The subtopic descriptions are deliberately crafted to be less prescriptive to allow for submitters to customize their individual applications to the specific technology areas of their interest and not to limit the diversity of those technologies. Applicants are encouraged to clearly define and describe the differentiating characteristics of their specific submission including the specific assumptions and input date for their preliminary cost analysis.\nQ.\u00a0Are there any specific criteria you can share for determining whether a proposed technology has a clear, direct, and immediate relevance and impact to the solar industry?\nA. SETO leaves it up to the applicant to define and demonstrate the immediate relevance and impact of their proposed technology to the solar industry.\nQ.\u00a0Can one submit multiple letters of intent or proposals to the same sub-topic?\nA. Yes, provided that they are distinctively different. Please check the FOA document for formal specific details on the application process and eligibility.\nQ.\u00a0Can one submit multiple letters of intent for different technologies/systems/software?\nA. Yes. Multiple letters of intent are allowed if they are clearly for distinctly different applications and involve different technologies/systems/software.\nQ.\u00a0If one applies to both SIBR/STTR and are approved for both, does that mean they get 400k in phase 1?\nA. No. One cannot receive two awards for the same proposal. If a single application is eligible for both the SBIR and STTR programs and is submitted to both, SETO will determine, after evaluation of the application, if it is selected as an SBIR or STTR award. If a selection and award is made it will be a single award, either as SBIR or as STTR. Please check the FOA document for formal specific details on eligibility requirements for SBIR and STTR and for the process of submitting to both.\nQ.\u00a0Where can I check the status of my letter of intent, proposed solutions, and any other status related inquiries?\nA. Notices are sent by email after submission to Grants.gov website. Please note that for letters of intent email notices will be sent out only to LOIs that are deemed non-responsive. If the letter is considered responsive, no notice will be sent. In general, some application status updates are shown via the application submission system. Please check the DOE Office of Science SBIR/STTR webpage for any updates on the program dates and deadlines and direct any questions about application status to the DOE SBIR/STTR Office.\nQ.\u00a0Is it possible to receive both TABA and SBIR, or are candidates only considered for one of the two opportunities?\nA. Technical and Business Assistance (TABA) is part of the SBIR/STTR award, not a separate award. One cannot receive TABA without receiving an SBIR/STTR award. Please check the FOA document for formal specific details on TABA. General information on TABA can also be found on the same website under the \u201cAwardee Resources\u201d section.\nQ.\u00a0Is TABA different from the Phase 0 Application Assistance?\nA. Yes, they are two completely different programs and should not be confused. The DOE Phase 0 SBIR/STTR assistance program is not part of this FY24 SBIR/STTR Phase I, Release 2 FOA and has a different application process, while applying for TABA is part of the FOA application. Find details on the Phase 0 Assistance Program and details on the TABA program.\nQ.\u00a0Can you specify the expected benchmarks for price and performance improvements for the proposed solar technologies, and how these benchmarks are established?\nA. SETO will not be using any specific benchmarks for evaluating any of the proposed ideas. But we would like to see in the proposals some analysis on how applicants believe that their technology and proposed development compares to the current status of the industry and to what they perceive their competition to be.\nQ.\u00a0What are the key differentiators that SETO is looking for in innovations compared to existing commercially available solar products or solutions?\nA. The solar topic 17 seeks Innovations with the potential for future commercialization that improve the affordability, reliability, and domestic benefit of solar technologies on the electric grid are sought. Applications must include a clear assessment of the state of the art and how the proposed technology would represent a significant improvement, along with a basic cost-model analysis showing a path to becoming cost-competitive with current state of the art and the potential to increase solar generation on the grid. Subtopics within solar have additional guidance in the FY24 SBIR/STTR Phase I, Release 2 topics document.\nQ.\u00a0Could you provide more details on the requirements for the preliminary cost analysis, especially regarding the assumptions and input data sources?\nA. A basic cost-model analysis showing a path to becoming cost-competitive with current state of the art and the potential to increase solar generation on the grid that clearly identifies assumptions and sources of input data is described in the FY24 SBIR/STTR Phase I, Release 2 topics document.\nQ.\u00a0Are there any specific criteria you can share for determining whether a proposed technology has a clear, direct, and immediate relevance and impact to the solar industry?\nA. Such specific criteria vary depending upon the nature of the specific proposed innovation and project.\nQ. Is teaming with existing solar providers/integrators encouraged for this proposal?\nA. Please refer to the FOA document, when it is released on the DOE Office of Science SBIR/STTR webpage for details on the funding opportunity description and requirements. It is, however, up to the applicant to decide on the necessary project team qualification to perform the proposed scope of work and to clearly demonstrate them as part of their application.\nQ. It appears that there might be some overlap between subtopics 17(a) (\u201cPower Electronic Technologies for Solar Systems\u201d) and 17(d) (\u201cSolar Hardware and Software Technologies: Affordability, Reliability, Performance, and Manufacturing\u201d) with respect to control and analytics software solutions. Do you have any guidance as to what applications are more appropriate for each subtopic?\nA. Subtopic 17(a) focuses on local control systems and firmware for individual power electronic devices, like for example internal controls of inverters or multiport converters. Energy management systems or control systems that coordinate multiple resources, such as distributed energy resource management systems, virtual power plant operation, aggregator functionality, or other coordinated control schemes of multiple devices are more relevant to subtopic 17(d).\nQ. In subtopic 17(a) would increasing durability and reliability of solar inverters via improvements in cooling systems be considered in scope?\nA. Improved designs and manufacturing processes for solar inverters/converters that could minimize failures and their impacts resulting in more reliable and durable power electronics devices for solar systems are areas of interest for this subtopic; however, potential applications much demonstrate a clear and direct impact to the solar industry and have a solar application or product as an end goal and not focus on just the design and development of a generic cooling system that could be beneficial to any electronic application by including it in the design of such products at a future stage.\nQ. It appears that there might be some overlap between subtopics 17(a) (\u201cPower Electronic Technologies for Solar Systems\u201d) and 17(d) (\u201cSolar Hardware and Software Technologies: Affordability, Reliability, Performance, and Manufacturing\u201d) with respect to control and analytics software solutions. Do you have any guidance as to what applications are more appropriate for each subtopic?\nA. Subtopic 17(a) focuses on local control systems and firmware for individual power electronic devices, like for example internal controls of inverters or multiport converters. Energy management systems or control systems that coordinate multiple resources, such as distributed energy resource management systems, virtual power plant operation, aggregator functionality, or other coordinated control schemes of multiple devices are more relevant to subtopic 17(d).\nQ. Are innovative ideas on electrical balance of system specifically designed for floating solar applications in scope for subtopic 17(d)?\nA. Yes, technology components and systems for application-specific needs, like floating photovoltaics, are an area of interest. Please note however that technologies that do not have a clear, direct, and immediate relevance and impact to the solar industry and do not have an immediate solar application or product as their end goal are not of interest.\nQ. The language of subtopic 17(d) states that one of the specific areas of interest for this subtopic is \u201cInnovative software solutions that will increase the competitiveness of the U.S. solar industry. This may include but is not limited to decreasing solar deployment barriers, expanding to new solar markets, reducing non-hardware costs of installations such as permitting, system design, or interconnection, and/or enabling new business models.\u201d However, the same subtopic mentions that applications will be considered nonresponsive and declined without external merit review if they involve \u201cDuplicative software solutions with many existing competitors in the market, including software to facilitate system design or system monitoring and any software solution to improve customer acquisition processes.\u201d Is there a discrepancy in the language, as it sounds contradictory?\nA. Innovative software solutions related to system design are in scope for this specific subtopic 17(d). The key point in the description of the nonresponsive area is the duplicative software solutions that replicate functionality that is already available in the market in these areas. Please note, however, that software solutions to improve customer acquisition processes are not of interest and are considered nonresponsive under this subtopic.\nQ. What are the technologies of interest under subtopic 17(d) (\u201cSolar Hardware and Software Technologies: Affordability, Reliability, Performance, and Manufacturing\u201d)?\nA. Please carefully read the subtopic description in the FY24 SBIR/STTR Phase I, Release 2 topics document. Topics listed as NOT of interest in this are specifically not of interest and applications on these topics will be considered nonresponsive and declined without review. Other hardware and software technologies that improve affordability, reliability, performance, and manufacturing of solar systems are in scope. The topic language includes specific areas of special interest and preference, but ideas and technologies are not limited to these areas only.\nQ. Regarding solar VPPs, in subtopic 17(d), does SETO have a specific target profile (residential vs. commercial) in mind?\nA. No, SETO does not constrain applications to a specific target profile and the area of interest is open for applicants to propose their ideas.\nQ. Regarding solar VPPs, in subtopic 17(d), would the end target of the proposal be to have a technology that is already integrated into a grid/utility partner at the conclusion of Phase II?\nA. Please refer to the FOA document, when it is released on the DOE Office of Science SBIR/STTR webpage for details on the funding opportunity description and requirements. The document will explain the expectations of each phase of an SBIR/STTR award.\nQ. In subtopic 17(d) regarding improved operation and maintenance, could you elaborate on what it meant by imminent power loss? Would this be at a per-panel level or at an installation level (detecting loss-of-power from the grid)?\nA. One of the areas of interest under subtopic 17(d) is technologies that improve operation and maintenance of PV systems. These can include self-contained smart PV systems with sensors that detect actual or imminent power loss, or mobile instrumentation for low-cost field diagnostics. This refers to loss of operation of the PV system either at the panel level or at the PV system level (like entire PV plan trips). The systems of interest are primarily PV installation monitoring system to detect internal problems. However, systems that could potentially detect external issues that could affect the PV installation and proactively respond to them to benefit the PV system operation could also be considered. However, this subtopic is not interested in system that monitor assets on the grid side of the point of interconnection or more general utility monitoring systems.\nOffice of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy\nForrestal Building\n1000 Independence Avenue, SW\nWashington, DC 20585\nAn office of"

Advanced Computing and Software; Integrated Sensing and Cyber; Space Technology\nOBJECTIVE: Space assets are currently almost completely operated from the ground.\u00a0 In order to ensure operation in an increasingly contested space environment, the spacecraft must make autonomous decisions and take action.\u00a0 The USSF will require trusted autonomous spacecraft to operate throughout their lifetimes under these circumstances.\u00a0 Hence, technology is needed to provide long periods of time without operator intervention, and this need should be extended to the life of the vehicle.\nDESCRIPTION: Create an on-orbit autonomous software suite or architecture which can autonomously evaluate and recommend courses of action in combination with information derived off-board, doing so autonomously when needed.\nThe current state of the art is that many autonomous sub-modules for spacecraft control have been devised.\u00a0 The modules vary in their use from CubeSats up to small refrigerator sized form factor systems and from single spacecraft to clusters/mega constellations.\u00a0 But there has not been an effort to bring together these advances into a lifetime autonomous software suite.\u00a0 The full capability desired for this tech topic is to go beyond single modular autonomy approaches to one of operating through normal pattern of life from launch and early orbit to normal operations, to end of life.\u00a0 While the goal is a fully autonomous on-orbit system, multiple sub-elements are needed to develop a trusted capability and which the effort solution would need to address: 1) Data analytics techniques such as machine intelligence to build statistical understanding of a spacecraft\u2019s own normal pattern of life, deviations and course of action (COA) assessment tools 2) Methods for validation and verification of autonomous decision-making 3) Visualization tools focused on interaction between autonomous system and human users 4) A cyber-secure environment for this software suite\u00a0 5) Electronics capability to enable computation and COA execution on-orbit.\nPHASE I: Conduct a comprehensive review of current research in spacecraft autonomy including academic, civil and commercial sources.\u00a0 Investigate and compile the possible requirements for an integrated autonomy suite including key subsystems such as guidance, navigation, and control; thermal; propulsion; communications; and payload maintenance over the three major phases of spacecraft lifetime: Launch and early orbit, normal operations, and end of life.\u00a0 Describe how to merge current work on modular autonomous software and provide a design path to integrate across multiple subsystems software modules and across the life cycle of the spacecraft.\u00a0 The form factor of the spacecraft could range from a CubeSat up to a rideshare class (size of a half refrigerator) which may require different solutions.\u00a0 The deliverable should be a critical design review (CDR) quality engineering artifact and or a demonstration of the qualities of a lifecycle autonomy on a testbed (Software in the loop (SIL)) by the proposer.\nPHASE II: Phase II will build and deliver a breadboard (TRL5)\u00a0 or hardware in the loop (HIL) quality solution, to be demonstrated on at least one form factor size, from 6, 12, 27 U CubeSat up to rideshare class (size of half a refrigerator), for vehicles of 3-year, 5-year and 10-year operational lifetimes.\u00a0 The simulation shall take in normal environmental influences, micrometeoroid impacts, radiation events, and maintain the vehicle operations in all three life phases as well as maintain a positive energy balance, pointing stability, and payload operational environments.\u00a0 Payloads can be communications, navigation, and sensing.\nPHASE III DUAL USE APPLICATIONS: The prototype lifetime autonomous system from Phase 2 shall be tested by a government sponsored entity (UARC, FFRDC, DoD Lab) to validate the capability of the software and hardware to meet the requirements.\u00a0 Formal documentation will be provided to enable the proposer to share the architecture verification and validation with others in the supply chain as a direct injection to the DIB.\nEvaluate and document transition opportunities for utilization in approved Government and civilian applications.\nREFERENCES:\nKEYWORDS: autonomous spacecraft;
