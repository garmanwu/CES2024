        "raw_content": "New Apple mini look-a-like device could help track your health at home\nUltrahuman\nGet a daily digest of the latest news in tech, science, and technology, delivered right to your mailbox. Subscribe now.\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Policies You may unsubscribe at any time.\nAt CES 2024 Bengaluru, India-based health platform, Ultrahuman has unveiled a home-based health tracking device to help individuals track and improve the health of their living spaces. Dubbed Ultrahuman Home, the device tracks a large number of parameters inside the home in a bid to improve passive factors that affect our health.\nWearable health devices have come a long way since their introduction to the market. From being able to just count the number of steps taken each day, the devices can now measure heart rate, blood pressure, sleeping patterns, activity levels, and much more and present a much more holistic picture of one's health.\nHowever, these trackers cannot measure external factors such as pollution or carbon dioxide levels in the room, temperature, and humidity, which also have long-term effects on individual health. Home health monitors do exist in the market to keep a tab on these factors, but as Ultrahuman points out, they do not provide a longitudinal view of how they change over time or how they may have impacted one's health.\nWith a slew of existing personal health tracking products, Ultrahuman Home can help correlate the environment to lifestyle outcomes and provide actionable measures that individuals can take to improve them.\nFactors monitored by Ultrahuman Home\nThe home-based device can measure levels of ultraviolet and sunlight inside the living space to provide a picture of the natural light available. Sunlight is well well-known source of vitamin D, whose deficiency has been linked with sleep disturbances. Ultrahuman claims that natural light can help improve Vitamin D levels and maintain a better circadian rhythm.\nUltrahuman\nApart from natural light, the system also monitors blue light exposure emanating from artificial lights that suppress melatonin and increase the risk of sleeping disorders and insomnia. Ultrahuman Home can help users foster a better living and sleep environment.\nParticulate Matter (PM) is not just a concern in crowded places and traffic jams but also in your home these days and Ultrahuman Home is designed to detect it and alert you when PM levels cross a threshold in the house. Long-term or high-level PM exposure impacts respiratory health and can also lead to cardiovascular dysfunction.\nThe home also tracks the noise levels and the frequency of such events per hour to help determine if your sleep efficiency, as monitored by Ultrahuman's sleep tracking device AIR, is being impacted by them. Urban noise in environments could be the reason for your poor sleep patterns or even the need for sleep medications.\nThe device also tracks the levels of smoke in the room, which can also double up as a fire hazard sensor. Additionally, it tracks humidity levels to help maintain them at optimal levels. Too little or too much humidity has been known to increase the risk of respiratory infections, the company added.\nUltrahuman\nPricing and Availability\nThe company has also ensured that the device's functioning does not interfere with the health goals users are trying to achieve and uses a dim-light feature to minimize impact on sleep patterns. On-demand microphones and on-device processing are additional features that protect individual privacy while using the device.\n\"Ultrahuman\u00a0Home marks a pioneering move in the health wearable space,\" said Mohit Kumar, Founder and CEO of\u00a0Ultrahuman, in the press release. \"Using the unique markers from the Home device, we\u2019d be able to link an individual\u2019s health markers to their environment. This on-body and off-body health tracking integration is the first time in the health monitoring space.\"\nThe device is priced at $349 and will be available on Kickstarter in January."

        "raw_content": "Ultrahuman Revolutionizes Home Health with the Launch of Ultrahuman Home\nLas Vegas, Nevada - January 9, 2023; Ultrahuman, a pioneer in wearable tech, launched Ultrahuman Home, a cutting-edge invention that revolutionizes the home tech segment. Unveiled at CES 2024 in January, Ultrahuman Home introduces a new capability for individuals to track and enhance the health of their living spaces.\u200d\nUnderstanding the Impact on Individual Health\u200d\nUltrahuman Home addresses the often-overlooked aspect of the living environment in the overall health stack. The sleek yet powerful device will provide insights on an individual's external environment including exposure to artificial light, air quality, humidity and noise levels. It\u2019s a first for the wearable space to leverage home health data and correlate the home environment (humidity, air quality, temperature) to an individual\u2019s lifestyle (sleep, stress). Personalizing or changing these markers' basis recommendations from the Ultrahuman home platform will help improve the passive factors that affect an individual\u2019s health. Passive markers like PM, CO2 and temperature are important because of their impact on health compounds over time.\n\u200d\nAdvantage over regular home health monitors\nRegular home health monitors measure many markers like PM, humidity, temperature etc but don\u2019t provide a longitudinal view of how these markers change over time. This is especially important when interpreted in the context of their impact on health. This view and correlation with a user\u2019s health markers is the first time ever in the health tracking space and has the potential to change the lives of millions of people who could benefit by making these changes to their living environments.\n\u200d\nInnovative Capabilities\nUltrahuman Home offers advanced capabilities to provide users with comprehensive insights and timely interventions:\n1. Natural Light Spectrum: Sunlight is a natural source of vitamin D, and adequate vitamin D levels are important for maintaining healthy sleep patterns. Several studies have shown a relationship between vitamin D deficiency and sleep disturbances, such as shorter sleep duration and daytime sleepiness 123. With Ultrahuman Home, users can measure UV and sunlight levels within their home, emphasizing the importance of maintaining optimal Vitamin D for healthy sleep patterns and circadian rhythm.\n2. PM Detection: Exposure to particulate matter (PM) particles can adversely affect human health. PM is a type of air pollution that consists of microscopic particles with varying sizes and chemical compositions. Several studies have shown that long-term exposure to high levels of PM can lead to respiratory system damage, cardiovascular dysfunction, and other chronic diseases 12. Ultrahuman Home will actively measure and notify users about particulate matter (PM) levels in the air, ensuring a safer living environment and promoting long-term respiratory health.\n3. Noise Detection: Maintaining healthy ambient noise levels in living environment is key to sleep health. Understand the optimal noise band that\u2019s personalised as per your sleep patterns.\n4. Sleep Disturbances and Apnea: With multiple super-precision mics and on-device sound processing, measure sleep disturbances and potential apnea events.\n5. Humidity levels: Optimum humidity for the lungs is achieved when the inspired gas is at body core temperature and 100% relative humidity 1. Insufficient humidity can lead to drying of the airways, impaired mucociliary clearance, and increased risk of respiratory infections 1. On the other hand, excessive humidity can promote the growth of microorganisms and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia 2. Therefore, maintaining appropriate humidity levels is crucial for respiratory health. Ultrahuman Home helps monitor humidity and empowers users to regulate their environment for optimal lung health. \u200d\n6. Blue light exposure: Exposure to artificial light suppresses melatonin, the sleep-inducing hormone, which can lead to sleeping issues or disorders such as insomnia. With artificial light monitoring sensors within Ultrahuman Home, users can prioritize well-being, understand its impact on circadian rhythm, and foster a healthier sleep environment.\u200d\n7. Smoke Sensor: The device comes equipped with a smoke sensor, adding an extra layer of protection against potential respiratory issues and fire hazards. It is expected to be available by the end of 2024.\n8. Continuous Temperature Monitoring: By analyzing the external temperature, you can optimize your sleep environment for improved rest, with positive influences on the body's circadian rhythm and overall sleep efficiency.\n\u200d\n\"Ultrahuman Home marks a pioneering move in the health wearable space. Using the unique markers from the Home device, we\u2019d be able to link an individual\u2019s health markers ( sleep, stress ) to their environment ( temperature, humidity and light exposure ). This on-body and off-body health tracking integration is the first time ever in the health monitoring space. \" said Mohit Kumar, Founder and CEO of Ultrahuman.\n\u200d\nPrioritizing Privacy\nUltrahuman Home prioritizes privacy with a mic button for on-demand microphone control and on-device processing. Its dim light feature supports sleep health by minimizing disruptions to circadian rhythms.\n\u200d\nAirplane Mode\nThe device offers wifi and Bluetooth control, empowering users to manage exposure and align with a proactive approach to health choices.\nAvailability and Pricing\nUltrahuman Home will be available for purchase on Kickstarter at the end of January 2024 for USD $349, with shipping starting in July.

        "raw_content": "Ultrahuman Unveils Innovative Home Device to Enhance Health by Monitoring Environment\nIn a significant move to revolutionize home health, Ultrahuman, the pioneering start-up in the health-focused wearable technology market, has announced the launch of their latest innovation, the Ultrahuman Home device at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. This ground-breaking product is designed to monitor the immediate environment of the user and provide valuable insights into how external factors are impacting their health.\nA New Approach to Health Monitoring\nThe Ultrahuman Home device is a compact, yet power-packed box full of sensors that can track crucial markers in the user\u2019s immediate environment. These markers include natural light, particulate matter, humidity levels, noise, and exposure to blue light. The device is aimed at helping users understand how their environment is affecting their health and wellbeing. Furthermore, the device is equipped with features to support sleep health, such as identifying disturbances during sleep and providing insights into sleep quality and sleep apnea.\nA Step Beyond Wearable Technology\nThe Ultrahuman Home device is a departure from the company\u2019s previous products, such as the smart ring. While the smart ring focused on personal health monitoring, the Home device expands the scope to include environmental health monitoring. The device will provide data in the form of space scores and actionable insights to the Ultrahuman app, thereby integrating data from inside and outside the body. The end goal is to help users make significant lifestyle changes based on these insights.\nPrivacy and Pricing\nUltrahuman has addressed privacy concerns by restricting the processing of data captured by the onboard microphone to the device itself, with no sound data uploaded to its servers. The device also comes with an on-demand microphone control for added privacy. As for the pricing, the Ultrahuman Home device will be offered for a one-off cost of $349 with no subscription required. This competitive pricing is expected to boost the company\u2019s revenues substantially and grow its user base.\nSetting Ultrahuman Apart in the Market\nWhile the CES is known for big names in healthtech showcasing their latest products, Ultrahuman is confident that their unique approach will set them apart from more generic platforms such as Apple and Fitbit. The company believes that specialists in health verticals can prosper by offering deeper data and insights. Thus, the competition for Ultrahuman is likely to come from other specialists in the health-focused wearable technology market, rather than the bigger names.\nFuture Plans and Expectations\nUltrahuman CEO, Mohit Kumar, envisions the Home device to eventually plug into home automation systems and make automated decisions to improve sleep quality and overall wellness. In the meantime, users can look forward to the device\u2019s launch on Kickstarter at the end of January 2024. With this innovative approach to health tracking, Ultrahuman is set to redefine how we manage and monitor our health in the future.\nComments\nComments\nComment field is required\nToday\nLog In to enter the fullscreen mode\nChat history will be saved only for authenticated users.

        "raw_content": "Ultrahuman's next health tracker is a box that monitors your home environment\nSmart ring upstart Ultrahuman is expanding from traditional health and fitness trackers to 'home health', launching a tracking box at CES 2024 that monitors the user's home environment.\nIn contrast to the relatively intimate form factor of something like the Ultrahuman Ring Air, the Ultrahuman Home is instead a relatively non-descript box designed to remain stationary and log the likes of air quality, artificial light, temperature, and noise levels in the home.\nIt then hopes to pass information and insights onto the user in the hope of aiding healthy habits. If it spots your home's natural light lacking, for example, it might recommend that you make changes to ensure your circadian rhythm or vitamin D intake doesn't suffer.\nIt's not yet clear whether it syncs up with the company's smart rings to deliver more accurate insights into things like sleep - given that the Home is also used to detect noises like snoring during the night - but we do know it's able to also assess particulate matter (PM), smoke, and humidity to aid respiratory health.\nUltrahuman\nAs the company did with its Ring Air, the Home will be launched on Kickstarter initially.\nThe campaign will go live toward the end of January with an expected shipping date of July, with backers expected to shell out $349 for the Home.\nTraditionally, we would be cautious about crowdfunded campaigns - especially ones with such a tight turnaround. Ultrahuman has proven itself in this arena, though, and that makes the Home a pretty compelling device on paper.\nThe real proof will be in everyday use, as ever - and a lot will also rest, we think, on the link-up with its smart rings. If Ultrahuman gets that right, it could be onto a winner.\nHow we test\nBy Conor Allison\nConor moved to Wareable Media Group in 2017, initially covering all the latest developments in smartwatches, fitness trackers, and VR.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nSmart ring brand Ultrahuman introduces new tracking device that monitors your home\nUltrahuman launches home tracking device that measures how your environment affects your health\nSmart ring and wearable technology brand, Ultrahuman has just announced its latest innovation, Ultrahuman Home. Unveiled at CES 2024, Ultrahuman is expanding into smart home with its new tracking technology that monitors your living environment to enhance your health and wellbeing.\nUp until now, Ultrahuman has been known for its wearable devices, particularly its smart rings that monitor sleep, movement and recovery. Similar to the best fitness trackers, Ultrahuman\u2019s devices sit on the finger and are equipped with sensors and tracking features to oversee your health, wellness and fitness. For more details, see our Ultrahuman Ring Air review for more.\nNow, Ultrahuman is putting health and wellness at the forefront of your environment with Ultrahuman Home. The compact screenless device is designed to address your living environment and how it may be positively or negatively affecting your health. This innovation marks a first for the wearable space as unlike the best smartwatches, Ultrahuman Home can \u201cleverage home health data and correlate the home environment to an individual\u2019s lifestyle\u201d.\nWhat this means is once the device is set-up in your home, the Ultrahuman Home will assess and monitor your surroundings and provide insights on your living space, including air quality, temperature, noise levels and artificial light. After collecting this data, Ultrahuman Home will evaluate how these factors may be affecting your health and will make suggestions on how you can make improvements.\nBy using the Ultrahuman Home\u2019s unique tracking markers, Mohit Kumar, founder and CEO of Ultrahuman states that it\u2019s \u201cable to link an individual\u2019s health markers (sleep, stress) to their environment (temperature, humidity and light exposure).\u201d So, what exactly does the Ultrahuman Home monitor and why?\nThe Ultrahuman Home covers all bases, including light, sound, air pollution, humidity and more. As sunlight is important for regulating the circadian rhythm and increasing the body\u2019s vitamin D levels, the Ultrahuman Home measures UV and sunlight levels in the home and encourages users to make changes to their surroundings to introduce more sunlight for better sleep and wellness.\nSpeaking of sleep, the Ultrahuman Home identifies sleep disturbances by monitoring noise levels and blue light exposure, both factors that disrupt your night\u2019s rest. The Ultrahuman Home can also deliver insights into sleep apnea and snoring to help users understand their sleep patterns and adopt a healthier sleep environment. Other markers that the Ultrahuman Home detects and monitors are particulate matter (PM), humidity levels and smoke sensors to promote long-term respiratory health and keep you safe while at home.\nJudging from the pictures, the Ultrahuman Home plugs into an outlet and sits inconspicuously in your home for monitoring purposes. What makes me curious is how it\u2019s going to feed users information \u2013 will it talk to you like Alexa or send you notifications via your smartphone? \u2013 and if it can monitor multiple spaces at a time and not just the room it\u2019s in.\nAs someone who enjoys tracking health and fitness data, I\u2019m intrigued by the Ultrahuman Home and excited to see how the device actually works in real homes. The Ultrahuman Home will be available towards the end of January 2024 and as of writing, it\u2019ll only be available in the US for $349.\nGet the T3 newsletter!\nAll the best features, news, tips and great deals to help you live a better life through technology\nBeth is Home Editor for T3, looking after style, living and wellness.

This is especially important when interpreted in the context of their impact on health. This view and correlation with a user's health markers aims to change the lives of millions of people who could benefit by making these changes to their living environments.\nInnovative Capabilities\nUltrahuman Home offers advanced capabilities to provide users with comprehensive insights and timely interventions:\nNatural Light Spectrum: Sunlight is a natural source of vitamin D, and adequate vitamin D levels are important for maintaining healthy sleep patterns. With Ultrahuman Home, users can measure UV and sunlight levels within their home, emphasizing the importance of maintaining optimal Vitamin D for healthy sleep patterns and circadian rhythm.\nPM Detection: Exposure to particulate matter (PM) particles can adversely affect human health. PM is a type of air pollution that consists of microscopic particles with varying sizes and chemical compositions. Ultrahuman Home is expected to actively measure and notify users about particulate matter (PM) levels in the air, in order to ensure a safer living environment and promoting long-term respiratory health.\nNoise Detection: Noise during sleep can disrupt sleep. Noise exposure variables, such as equivalent noise level and number of noise events per hour, are associated with increased percentage mobility during sleep and decreased sleep efficiency. Ultrahuman Home helps identify disturbances during sleep as well as additional insights like sleep apnea and snoring, equipping users with insights into sleep quality and acknowledging the interconnectedness of different facets of well-being.\nHumidity levels: Optimum humidity for the lungs is achieved when the inspired gas is at body core temperature and 100% relative humidity 1. Insufficient humidity can lead to drying of the airways, impaired mucociliary clearance, and increased risk of respiratory infections 1. On the other hand, excessive humidity can promote the growth of microorganisms and increase the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia. Therefore, maintaining appropriate humidity levels is crucial for respiratory health. Ultrahuman Home helps monitor humidity and empowers users to regulate their environment for optimal lung health.\nBlue light exposure: Exposure to artificial light suppresses melatonin, the sleep-inducing hormone, which can lead to sleeping issues or disorders such as insomnia. With artificial light monitoring sensors within Ultrahuman Home, users can prioritize well-being, understand its impact on circadian rhythm, and foster a healthier sleep environment.\nSmoke Sensor: The device comes equipped with a smoke sensor, adding an extra layer of protection against potential respiratory issues and fire hazards. It is expected to be available by the end of 2024.\n\"Ultrahuman Home marks a pioneering move in the health wearable space. Using the unique markers from the Home device, we'd be able to link an individual's health markers (sleep, stress) to their environment (temperature, humidity and light exposure).
