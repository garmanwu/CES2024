Subscribe now.\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Policies You may unsubscribe at any time.\nAs one of the largest events in the technology space is about to conclude, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 has seen some pioneering innovations in AI and automotive systems.\nCES 2024 saw more than 250 exhibitors display their products and services in automotive technology, primarily focused on clean energy, in-car systems, and autonomous driving.\nWe have shortlisted the top five innovations in this field that aim to transform the user experience in upcoming vehicles.\n5. ChatGPT-enabled infotainment\nVolkswagen announced that it has integrated the AI-based chatbot ChatGPT into its IDA voice assistant, ushering in a new era in automotive technology.\nThe advancement was enabled by the firm's collaboration with Cerene Inc. via its Chat Pro system. The feature will be offered in the current generation of Volkswagen models based on its MEB and MQB Evo platforms and those that use its IDA voice assistant.\nVolkswagen\nBy integrating with Cerence Chat Pro, the innovation enhances the functionalities of the IDA voice assistant. Users will be able to control a range of functions spanning from infotainment and navigation to air conditioning control, all using voice commands. Additionally, it can also provide answers to general questions, ending those in-car arguments.\nThe integration of ChatGPT through Cerence Chat Pro is designed with a focus on user privacy and data protection by excluding access to any vehicle-specific information.\nThis feature will be accessible across a range of Volkswagen models from early 2024, including the new Tiguan and Passat, the new Golf, and the ID.3, ID.4, ID.5, and ID.7.\n4. Honda's 'O' EV lineup\nThe Japanese automaker unveiled its 'Honda 0 Series', a new electric vehicle (EV) lineup set to hit North American roads from 2026 onwards. The company also unveiled a brand-new emblem for the iconic 'H mark'. The emblem will be exclusively reserved for the upcoming generation of EV models.\nTwo concept vehicles in the Honda 0 Series were also premiered at CES 2024 \u2014 Saloon\u00a0and\u00a0Space-Hub. The Saloon represents the leading concept model within its new EV series, developed from the brand's philosophy of being \"Thin, Light, and Wise.\" The model, which is built on a new EV-only platform, features a low-floor, sporty dynamics, and efficient powertrains. The streamlined and futuristic design of the Saloon features a wedged nose, a flowing roofline, gullwing doors, and a high-set rear.\nThe Space Hub was developed\u00a0under the theme of \u201caugmenting people's daily lives\". The car features a panoramic roof and is designed to complement passengers seated facing each other at the back of the vehicle.\nWhile specific details on the powertrain and battery capacities available for the Honda 0 Series were not released, the company claims that all models will feature e-axles, which integrate the motor, inverter, and gearbox into the car's axle. Honda also claims these cars will support rapid charging, with a 15 to 80 percent charge taking less than 15 minutes.\nEnvisioning a greener automotive industry, Honda also shared its intention to make everything it produces and does carbon-neutral by 2050. The company confidently stated that it aims to sell only EVs and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) globally by 2040.\n3. Sony's updated Afeela EV\nAt CES 2024, Sony announced the updated Afeela, a concept EV that was originally unveiled last year, by driving it onto the stage using a PS5 controller. A joint venture project with Honda as part of Sony Honda Mobility (SHM), the Afeela is an evolution from Sony's Vision S concept.\nIn addition to its remote control operations, the company also showcased a range of updates to the Afeela concept. Along with offering an array of games, the company's collaboration with Epic Games has now enabled augmented reality (AR) mapping. Utilizing data from the car's myriad sensors, and powered by the powerful Unreal Engine 5, SHM now offers immersive 3D maps of the car's surroundings, enhancing safety for occupants.\nSHM also plans to utilize this technology in gaming and entertainment domains as well, for which it is collaborating with virtual reality player Polyphony Digital. The partnership aims to create an immersive experience within the car.\nIn a strategic move, SHM has entered into an agreement with Microsoft, tapping into the Azure OpenAI Service to create a conversational, personal, customized agent for Afeela. SHM is also unlocking the doors of Afeela's developer space to create a platform for creators and developers to innovate and construct applications and services compatible with the EV.\nSHM has announced that it will start taking preorders for Afeela in 2025, with deliveries scheduled to begin in the spring of 2026. With two behemoths in the technology and automotive space joining hands to innovate, we expect much more to come out of the Afeela project in the coming years.\n2. Snapdragon Digital Chassis\nQualcomm Technologies and Robert Bosch GmbH announced the automotive industry\u2019s first central vehicle computer that is capable of hosting both infotainment and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) functionalities on a single system-on-chip (SoC).\nThe advancement will enable a central system to handle tasks related to safety and security requirements, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and automated driving requirements.\nThe cockpit and ADAS integration platform utilizes the Snapdragon Ride Flex System-on-Chip (SoC), which is an advanced and adaptable solution designed to support mixed-criticality workloads and offer high-performance capabilities. \"With this cost-effective solution, we are paving the way for bringing even more ADAS functions into vehicles, including in the entry-level and mid-range segment,\" said Christoph Hartung, president of the Cross-Domain Computing Solutions division at Bosch, in a statement.\nmetamorworks/iStock\nQualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chasis is already offering a suite of functionalities starting with the Snapdragon Auto Connectivity Platform that provides seamless and secure connectivity, cloud services, and over-the-air updates for vehicles. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon Cockpit Platform provides immersive experiences with features like high-resolution displays, 3D audio, voice, and gesture recognition, and augmented reality for both drivers and passengers.\nOn the other hand, the Snapdragon Ride Platform utilizes AI and computer vision to drive advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving features, including lanekeeping, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance. Lastly, the Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud ensures secure and scalable cloud connectivity, data management, and analytics tailored for vehicles.\n1. World's first digital cockpit\nStellantis, BlackBerry QNX, and AWS have teamed up to unveil\u00a0a first-of-its-kind virtual cockpit for automobiles at this year's CES.\nPart of the group's Virtual Engineering Workbench (VEW), the platform will greatly accelerate the delivery of cutting-edge car technology to customers. The key to this acceleration lies in the utilization of QNX Hypervisor in the cloud from BlackBerry, which functions as a virtual lab for developing car controls and systems.\nThe platform enables the creation of \"realistic virtual versions of car controls and systems, making them behave just like they would in a real car, but without needing to change the main software that runs them, taking what used to take months to be achieved down to 24 hours in some cases,\u201d according to a statement from the company.\nThrough the utilization of QNX Hypervisor via AWS Marketplace, Stellantis can now introduce an advanced simulation of a virtual cockpit into a cloud-based environment. The collaboration between Stellantis and AWS, a prominent cloud services provider, was established in January 2022.\nAccording to Stellantis, the virtual cockpit platform is equipped with impressive tools for the virtualization of graphics, audio, and inputs from the touchscreen, mouse, and keyboard. \"Software is becoming increasingly crucial in vehicles, leading us to innovate in how we develop and validate it. With our virtual cockpit, we're revolutionizing not just our approach, but also that of our suppliers and partners in the industry,\" said Yves Bonnefont, Chief Software Officer at Stellantis, in a statement."

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?
