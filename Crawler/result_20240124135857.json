        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nHesai Launches New High-Performance Lidar At CES\nHesai's new AT512 high-performance automotive lidar sensor\nNot so many years ago when automated driving was all the rage, there were more than 70 lidar startups around the world along with some established suppliers like Bosch developing their own sensors. It was alway inevitable that as the technology matured and started to come to market, those numbers would shrink dramatically, and that process has been ongoing. One of the survivors in the sector is China\u2019s Hesai which has just introduced its latest sensors at CES 2024 in Las Vegas.\nLidar adoption has remained relatively slow in North America and Europe, primarily due to slower than expected development of many of the systems expected to use these laser-powered sensors. But there are actually quite a few automakers in China now selling vehicles with this technology including Xpeng, Nio, Li Auto, SAIC and most recently Lotus.\nMuch of the early focus for Hesai was on rotating sensors similar to those originally introduced by lidar pioneer Velodyne (so similar that Velodyne sued Hesai for patent infringement and eventually got a licensing settlement). Those puck-like sensors have been used by many companies developing robotaxi systems including Zoox, Motional, Cruise and the late Argo AI. But they aren\u2019t really well suited to consumer vehicles, so Hesai has been developing other form factors.\nThe newly announced AT512 lidar is a high-performance sensor that is designed for mounting above the windshield, similar to what Luminar is doing with its sensors on Volvo, Polestar and SAIC vehicles. Unlike Luminar which uses 1550 nm lasers, all of Hesai\u2019s sensors are based on 905 nm lasers which are significantly lower in cost but the power output also has to be limited in order to avoid causing eye damage.\nDespite the lower power, Hesai claims a detection range of 300 m on a target with 10% reflectivity and a resolution of 2,400 x 512 pixels over a 120-degree horizontal field of view. This is generally considered to be sufficient for scanning the road ahead when driving at highway speeds beats the 250 m range claim of the Luminar Iris sensor. The AT512 has 8 times the resolution of the existing AT128 sensor, but is slightly smaller in volume.\nTrump Wins New Hampshire Primary\u2014Defeating Haley\nBiden Wins New Hampshire Democratic Primary\u2014Despite Absence From Ballot\nNikki Haley Vows To Stay In GOP Race After Losing New Hampshire To Trump\u2014Who Calls Her \u2018Delusional\u2019\nThe AT512 would be well suited to applications such as hands-free and even eyes-off driver assist systems. At 10 frames per second, it can generate 12,300,000 points per second.\nHesai ET25 lidar sensor designed for mounting behind the windshield\nThe second sensor that Hesai is showing at CES is the ET25. This is a slimmer sensor that is only about 1-inch tall and is very quiet at only 25 dBa while only consuming 12W of power. This sensor is specifically designed for installation behind the windshield where Hesai claims it can still detect 10% reflectivity targets at 225 m. The ET25 can only generate 3,000,000 points per second, but that should still be sufficient for hands-free systems like GM\u2019s Super Cruise as well as for enhanced automatic emergency braking systems. Like the AT series sensors, the ET25 is also a 905 nm unit but rather than the 1D rotating mirror, it uses a proprietary beam steering system that Hesai isn\u2019t discussing.\nHesai \"Maxwell\" R&D and manufacturing center near Shanghai, China\nMounting behind the windshield provides several advantages including being able to install it within the swept area of the windshield wipers to maintain visibility as well as improved aerodynamics and aesthetics and reduced risk of damage from debris. Behind the windshield mounting does require that an area of the glass needs to have left clear of infrared filter coating to allow the laser pulses to pass through. The only system that has currently been announced for production with a lidar behind the windshield is GM\u2019s Ultra Cruise which is expected to launch sometime in 2024 on the ne Cadillac Celestiq using a Cepton lidar sensor.\nHesai has also recently completed construction of its new \u201cMaxwell\u201d R&D center and factory near Shanghai, China. It is named after Scottish physicist James Maxwell who developed the equations that describe electromagnetism, optics and circuits. The 740,000 square foot facility is now producing over 10,000 sensors per month."

How is it advancing transportation?\nBy Marion Jablon Posen\nAutonomous vehicles are already traveling on the streets in cities across the United States. Lidar is the primary technology that navigates them. How does it work? Is it safe and reliable? How will it change driving culture?\nTo learn more about lidar and other artificial intelligence (AI) technologies already advancing in the automotive industry, MOTOR spoke with Bob in den Bosch, senior vice president of Global Sales of Hesai Technology, a leading company in the field.\nHesai\u202fTechnology\u202fwas named the top automotive lidar company for the second consecutive year by Yole\u202fGroup*, a global advisory and market analysis firm recognized for its expertise in the semiconductor, photonic and electronic sectors.\nThe concept of lidar is new to many of us, although we may have experienced it in action when we receive a warning signal that we are driving too close to another vehicle. MOTOR asked in den Bosch to explain lidar technology and how it is used in automotive applications, especially autonomous driving.\n\u201cLidar is an acronym that stands for Light Detection and Ranging. Lidar uses pulsed laser light to measure distances to objects within their range and field of view,\u201d in den Bosch explains. \u201cThe process begins with emitting a laser to its surroundings. The laser beam is reflected by things around the vehicle back to the receiver, which detects the signal. These reflected signals are then sent to a processor, which takes in the raw data and the split-second timing of each one and calculates the distance to each point of reflection. Millions of points together make up the 3D point cloud.\u201d\n\u201cNext, the point cloud goes through a converter and is sent to the car\u2019s computer. The car\u2019s computer and software then use the point cloud information in its advanced driver-assistance system (ADAS) and self-driving applications. These applications identify objects and help the vehicle navigate the road and respond to perceived safety issues.\u201d\nHow accurate is lidar data, and what are its limitations? in den Bosch says, \u201cThere are many lidar sensors available to the automotive industry with a wide variety of performance capabilities. Hesai\u2019s latest lidar sensor for mass market ADAS deployments, ET25, accurately measures distances and enables recognition for objects over 250m away (for objects with 10% reflectivity). Of course, there are many factors that determine a lidar\u2019s performance, including how dense the point cloud of the laser is, what angles the sensor\u2019s field of view can cover, and how the frequency at which the points are refreshed.\u201d \u00a0\u00a0\u201cHesai\u2019s ET25 has a frequency of over 3 million points per second and a field of view of 120o (horizontal range) and 25o (vertical range). One of the key factors to Hesai is sensor quality and reliability, which is challenging in mass production. Hesai has invested in technologies to ensure its sensor reliability in large-scale production. While lidar is currently considered by many vehicle manufacturers to be the most valuable sensor for ADAS and autonomous applications, it can suffer performance degradation from poor weather-related visibility issues such as fog, snow and heavy rain.\u201d\nAs lidar and other high-tech innovations influence the vehicle fleet, MOTOR asked, what essential skills will aftermarket service technicians need to be able to work on autonomous driving systems? How will training and education need to change?\n\u201cAs more computer systems, chips and software continue to enter the vehicle,\u201d in den Bosch explains, \u201ctechnician teams will need to add more systems training, awareness and problem-solving to their service capabilities. While many fixes and adjustments will be made over the air through software pushes and remote troubleshooting, basic systems capabilities related to system integration, user management and security will be required. The ability to check system performance with advanced tools will also be needed. Consumer trust relationships will also be an even more important part of the service experience, and an opportunity for differentiation and consumer loyalty as both complexity and privacy issues will come into play to a greater degree than before,\u201d in den Bosch says.\nHow will autonomous vehicles gain acceptance? Current polls show resistance from consumers.\nin den Bosch says, \u201cThe primary drivers to large-scale acceptance of fully autonomous vehicles are both performance proof at an overall statistical level for road safety and a clear return on investment evidence through case studies in various industries. In addition, the public will want to see the safety proof at both an overall level as well as on a case-by-case basis that there are no major failure stories. In addition, government and legislative support, combined with regulation to help ensure success, can be helpful to acceptance.\u201d\n\u201cFrom an ADAS perspective, we are seeing that from a consumer desirability point of view, technology is already becoming a preferred option. As more stories and studies emerge showing the increased passenger safety benefits, we expect the acceptance to grow strongly.\u201d\n\u201cReduced insurance costs for autonomous and ADAS vehicles should also help ensure acceptance and confidence.\u201d\nSpeaking of automotive insurance, how does in den Bosch predict the use of autonomous vehicles will affect consumer auto insurance?\n\u201cStudies such as the recent study by the American Auto Association (AAA) estimated that the current level of ADAS technology may prevent 37 million crashes, 14 million injuries, and 250,000 deaths over the next 30 years, representing a 16 percent drop in crashes and injuries and a 22 percent reduction in deaths that would otherwise occur without these technologies.\u201d\nin de Bosch continues, \u201cAutonomous vehicles should reduce premiums over time, but these reductions will again lag. Expected insurance reductions are based on ADAS adoption, as autonomous vehicles are generally more expensive and have lower adoption for statistical modeling purposes.\u201d\nFinally, MOTOR asked in den Bosch, looking into the future, how does he see autonomous driving evolving? What percentage of the motoring fleet does he think will be autonomous in the next 10 years?\n\u201cWhile autonomous vehicles are a rapidly growing segment of the vehicles on the road Hesai is seeing ADAS-enabled vehicles growing to mass adoption much more rapidly. We believe that well over half of all new vehicles will have ADAS capability by 2035. This represents a $300 billion to $400 billion-dollar ADAS market. In 2020, about 10 percent of vehicles had some ADAS functionality, but by 2050 over half of all vehicles on the road will have ADAS capability\u2014representing over a billion vehicles. While autonomous vehicles are currently growing at about the same pace, the total number of autonomous vehicles is expected to lag behind ADAS vehicles, but we expect over 30 million fully autonomous vehicles sold annually by 2040.\u201d\n*\u202fSource: Yole Intelligence,\u202fpart of the international market research and strategy consulting company Yole Group, has just released its \u201cLiDAR for Automotive 2023\u201d report, which ranks different companies by several key indicators of success.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: 5 new tech products stealing the show this year\nThe annual Consumer Technology Show rolled into the Las Vegas Convention Center last week. These are what we think are the most interesting pieces of tech coming from the event.\nWhile the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was dominated by artificial intelligence (AI) embedded into everything from laptops to TVs, tech companies also used the Las Vegas showroom floor to\u00a0highlight other kinds of cutting-edge innovation.\nFrom telescopes perfect for stargazing with friends to a transparent television, the trade show exhibited a range of exciting new gadgets that we expect to hit the market in 2024 and beyond. Here are some of our favorites.\nOdyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes\nUnistellar revealed new Odyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes, which are designed to make stargazing and capturing images of the night sky easier.\nThe telescopes are fitted with 'autonomous field detection technology' that helps stargazers to locate and view astronomical objects. Pairing the telescopes with the Unistellar app (available on Android and iOS) means users with no prior experience can navigate the night sky easily and can save images of observed objects to share with their friends.\nThe new smart telescopes, jointly developed by Nikon and Unistellar, were first announced in 2021 but are only now becoming available to the public.\nFor products that are intended to make skywatching more accessible, both have a hefty price tag, with the Unistellar Odyssey priced at $2,499 and the Unistellar Odyssey Pro at $3,999 \u2014 a premium price even for more advanced telescopes.\nRelated: Best telescopes for stargazing\nLG\u2019s transparent OLED TV\nA see-through TV may not have been on your radar, beyond the odd appearance in science fiction, but LG revealed the completely transparent LG Signature OLED T at CES.\nThis 77-inch TV is designed to blend seamlessly into a room's decor, resembling an art installation more than a classic TV, so you could, theoretically, even place it in front of a window without ruining the view.\nUnlike other concept products, LG actually plans to launch this device, although the company didn't specify a release date or price.\nRelated: 16 tech projects from 2023 that could change the world\nApple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset\nAfter revealing its Vision Pro mixed-reality device in June 2023, Apple used CES to finally announce it will be available to pre-order, with a release date of Feb 2 for customers in the United States.\nThe headset, priced at $3,499, is Apple's first new major product line since the Apple Watch launched in 2015. It augments the real world with a digital overlay, and users can control the device using their voice, gaze and hand gestures.\nWith features like sensors, cameras and built-in spatial audio speakers, the headset also lets users switch between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\nRelated: Best VR mindfulness games\nSwarovski's animal-identifying smart binoculars\nSwarovski Optik showcased the AX Visio, a pair of smart binoculars, that can identify different species of animals and insects \u2014 perfect for wildlife enthusiasts.\nThe 10x32 binoculars use built-in AI to identify species of birds, insects and mammals, showing you the name of that species when you lock onto the creature in the viewfinder.\nThere is also a dial in the middle to switch between animal identification, a compass and even a 4K camera setting. Users can store around 1,700 photos or one hour of video in full quality, which you can then download to smartphones or devices.\nThe high-tech binoculars will be unsurprisingly expensive,\u00a0costing $4,799 when they are released in\u00a0February.\nRelated: Best binoculars for wildlife spotting 2024\nThe HRM-Fit sports bra heart rate monitor\nGarmin announced a new $149.99 heart rate monitor at CES called the HRM-Fit. It's designed for people to attach to sports bras from a wide range of manufacturers, including Adidas and Athleta. It can capture training data like ground contact time balance and stride length, as well as real-time heart rate, without compromising movement or performance.\nThe device then transmits this information to other fitness devices like Garmin smartwatches or Edge cycling computers, as well as compatible fitness apps like Tacx Training.\nUsers will need a compatible Garmin device to get the most out of the HRM-Fit, but even without one, the HRM-Fit can capture information on steps, calories burned, intensity minutes and all-day heart rate.\nRelated: Best fitness trackers 2024\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nOrla is an NCTJ-trained journalist with a background in beauty, lifestyle and technology commerce journalism and has worked for leading titles such as The Mirror and MailOnline.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "2024 Lidar Industry Updates\nSummary\nScharfsinn86\nWestern LIDAR Cancelations\nDecember 2023 marked a challenging period for the lidar industry, with Tier 1 companies implementing cost-cutting measures and discontinuing their automotive programs, which included lidar development. Notably, Continental (OTCPK:CTTAF), Bosch (OTC:BSWQY), and ZF Friedrichshafen referred to as ZF, made the strategic decision to pivot away from lidar technology. Previously engaged in an autonomous shuttle program, ZF terminated this initiative, directly impacting Innoviz (INVZ). Although Innoviz downplayed the impact of the program's loss, the significance becomes more evident when considering that, in the company's Q3 presentation, the autonomous shuttle incorporated 4 to 6 lidars per vehicle.\nIn May 2023, Innoviz replaced Luminar (LAZR) when winning Volkswagen (OTCPK:VWAGY) ID. Buzz project, but the anticipated revenues from this deal aren't expected until mid-decade or post-2025. Consequently, this situation casts doubt on the previously projected $76M revenue for 2024, as the only source of revenue is the BMW I7 program managed by Magna, which has significantly lower revenue expectations due to Innoviz seeing lower margins from this deal.\nGM (GM) delivered a cancellation notice to Koito (OTCPK:KOTMY), a tier 1 partner of Cepton (CPTN), prompting Koito to propose buying Cepton shares it does not own for $3.17. I anticipate that Jun Pei, CEO of Cepton, will accept the offer since he was named a participating shareholder in the deal. The combined ownership of the two parties amounts to approximately 42% of the shares outstanding. The loss of GM contract by Cepton questions $33M in revenue expected in 2024. Despite possessing $62M in cash, sustaining the company until 2025, Koito's potential decision to privatize Cepton and its ability to incorporate it into its product lineup remains uncertain for the future of sensors. With Koito investing over $150M in Cepton, the buyout may serve as nothing more than damage control for its failed investment. On January 5th, the CFO of Cepton quit.\nAnother setback occurred for AEye (LIDR) as Continental terminated its partnership to produce a sensor, HRL 131, on licensed technology from AEye. Despite AEye's announcement of a new prototype in November, the dissolution of this crucial relationship is detrimental to the company's future. With $48M in cash at the end of Q3, the forecasted $12M in revenue for 2024 will no longer be there.\nThe Western lidar market capitalization leaders were not spared in the shuffles taken by OEMs or tier 1s. I mentioned that Innoviz has taken away Luminar's VW ID. Buzz shuttle project, but lost his own ZF platform due to ZF abandoning the autonomous shuttle program. The anticipated collaboration with VW for Innoviz seems to hinge on Audi. News from China indicates that Huawei may not only be offering the operating system for Audi vehicles destined for the Chinese market but also it is rumored to supply sensors to Audi.\nOn another note from China, BMW was recently granted permission to operate at the L3 level, prompting my speculation about Innoviz's involvement in the I7 in China. Against geopolitical tensions surrounding lidar, prospects for integrating Western lidar technology into mass-produced vehicles in China are diminishing. Concurrently, Hesai (HSAI) secured a global OEM design deal for a luxury line electric vehicle (EV). While I anticipate or hope this win is confined to China, it may be with BMW, but this remains speculation on my part. Hesai has been actively pursuing deals beyond China following its success with numerous Chinese OEMs.\nIf Hesai's global consumer ADAS win extends beyond China, it can impact the entire Western lidar industry. Investors in the lidar sector should closely monitor this development, as it holds substantial implications for the industry as the proverbial floodgates become open.\nLuminar lost Torc Robotics to Aeva (AEVA), which was especially surprising given that Daimler Truck was an investor. Despite the news, Luminar remains upbeat about its relationship with Daimler Truck, foreseeing deals in L2 and L3 autonomy, not L4, as made by Aeva.\nOn a brighter note, Luminar's significant agreement with Volvo (OTCPK:VOLAF) and Polestar (PSNY) is poised to place the company in the first place with a significantly higher revenue this year. The 2024 revenue estimate currently stands at $187M, and with a cash reserve of $300M forecasted by the end of Q4, Luminar is gearing up for a challenging period. The goal is to achieve a positive or breakeven Q4 gross margin, with an estimated $27M in revenue for the same period. This upcoming quarter represents a substantial test of the company's deliverables, and the results will hopefully set the tone and expectations for Luminar's business in 2024.\nSecond, in the market cap among Western lidar companies, MicroVision (MVIS) has been silent about its list of expected wins. MicroVision is not alone. As it stands out, no company has had a new win. Aeva named its win in January. However, that is not a recent win, as the company announced an OEM collaboration in August. I cannot consider the Luminar extension of the Mercedes deal a new win.\nThe latest series of cancellations suggests that the adoption of lidar, particularly in autonomous applications such as consumer-ADAS, robotaxis, and trucks, is shaping to be a mid-decade delay. The recent setback faced by Cruise, a carrier of Hesai sensors alongside Velodyne's Alpha Prime, underscores the challenges that robotaxis are encountering in the United States, with achieving full autonomy now under intense public scrutiny.\nOriginal equipment manufacturers prioritize lower costs and a more robust sensor solution than their initial deals. While the new generation of sensors is undeniably more powerful, the question remains whether the pricing aligns with market expectations. The automotive sector is proving highly price-sensitive, emphasizing the long-known truth of low margins, perhaps assisted by proprietary software sales whenever possible. One of the looming concerns for Western lidar companies is the emergence of mass-produced Chinese sensors, a threat driven by the economic implications of lidar technology coming from China (read as cheap) and continuous disregard for IP security.\nThe issue of lingering cash deficiencies is also worth considering. Aeva, which secured Torc for sensor application and its software, has projected a substantial $1B in revenue potential, as reported by Reuters. This $1B declaration mirrors similar claims made by Innoviz and Luminar when announcing their design wins. I've been describing these instances for a long time, categorizing them based on internal assessments rather than solid commitments from OEMs.\nThe events in December provided an explicit confirmation of the realities associated with these so-called \"contracts.\" This aligns with my perspective rooted in standard investing logic, emphasizing revenue growth, cash on hand, and profitability while cautioning against getting carried away by the hype surrounding headlines proclaiming $1B in revenue. Notably, Aeva production is set to commence in 2027 for a sensor that won't be available until 2025. Unsurprisingly to me, Luminar executives found Aeva's declaration to be much more than they had expected from Torc.\nTo bolster their win, Aeva opted to sell 36M shares at $0.58 per share and committed to a financing facility of $125M through a preferred share offering with existing shareholders. Aeva's $233M in Q3 was not considered satisfactory to reach Torc SOP. Aeva spent $90M in three quarters of 2023, so its yearly rate is about $120M. Without recent financing, the company would run out of money by 2025, and with it, without changing the pace of spending, will see Q1 2027.\nCancellations may have ended the futures of Cepton and AEye, but certainly, a new win for Avea made the second worst outcome for investors: dilution. The recent price appreciation is notable, but whether it is sustainable remains to be seen.\nOuster Q4 Update\nOuster (OUST) just released its preliminary Q4 results, and it looks like it passed the midpoint of its guidance range of $23M to $25M in expected revenue for the quarter. Suppose they hit $24.5M, that puts their revenue for 2023 at $83M. Based on the Q3 guidance of mid % revenue growth at 40%, I am projecting $116M for 2024. Utilizing the provided gross margin range of 35% to 40%, with the mid-level at 37.5%, I anticipate that Ouster will achieve around $43M in gross profit in 2024. I expect Ouster to beat that specific revenue expectation through 2024.\nOuster's absence from CES and no updates beyond Q3 on the DF sensor represent the company's communication consistency, which no longer surprises me. More and more, I think safeguarding its intellectual property (IP), especially considering the significant challenges it faced in US democratic trade institutions in 2023, resulting in white noise, is becoming a preferred modus operandi for the company.\nOuster faced a setback with the termination of the ITC investigation due to a technical default related to the existence of an arbitration agreement between Velodyne and Hesai. The company appears to choose not to file a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to contest the ITC decision. In September, Hesai filed with the Patent Trial and Appeal Board or PTAB, questioning the application of Ouster's patents\u2014a move that Ouster considered duplicitous, given that Hesai insisted on resolving all disputes through arbitration at JAMS in London during the ITC proceedings. Despite paying for an agreement to use Velodyne's IP, Hesai continues to deny infringing on Velodyne's patents. As Ouster expected during the ITC process, there has been no progress with JAMS. I also believe that PTAB has become a reason why the Federal case in Delaware against Hesai is stayed. PTAB reviews are scheduled for March and April of this year.\nNew products\nAEye sensors, (AEye Inc. )\nThe new product announced was Aeva's Atlas sensor; another was from Cepton, Ultra renamed/ or perhaps redesigned Vista -120 plus sensor. 4Sight\u2122 Flex from AEye was released in November. Ultra has offered all the specifications, and it is the smallest sensor in form factor, smaller than ET25 from Hesai.\nNew Ultra lidar sensor from Cepton (Cepton Technologies)\nAEye offered specifications without form factor size, but the picture above illustrates a huge reduction versus no longer in play Continental made HRL131. HRL131 was 7 cm high and 19 cm wide; Flex appears to be 3.5 cm and perhaps 10cm wide. Aeva declared that Atlas is 70% smaller than Aeries II, but it is hard to confirm without actual specs. It offered standard FoV for consumer ADAS, but no resolution in the news.\nAries II was the largest sensor out of all companies. That leaves now Iris Plus and Mavin from MicroVision as the largest form factor sensors.\nAeva lidar sensors: Aeries II vs Atlas, apparently 70% smaller? (Fleetowner.com)\n2024 Expectations\nIn my outlook for 2024, I anticipate Cepton being taken private by Koito, and AEye may experience further depreciation, possibly becoming an acquisition target for MEMS-based lidar companies. The company could be a relatively inexpensive buy for its library of patents and only valued at $12M. However, standing alone, I don't envision AEye operating beyond 2024, as the feasibility of winning any design contracts appears questionable, considering its current cash levels and the optimistic timeline of two years from design to implementation.\nI anticipate revenue reductions for all companies except Ouster, with the most interesting updates for Luminar and Innoviz from their current forecasted levels. My assumptions will be validated when Q4 results are announced, providing hopefully more precise yearly expectations. Both AEye and MicroVision will likely require some form of financing in 2024. Aeva has already secured funding, and beyond the two mentioned, all other companies should be able to operate until 2025 with their current cash levels.\nI maintain my investment in Ouster, as I perceive the company to be undervalued compared to its peers, despite a relative increase in value since Q3 (as indicated in the table below). I am optimistic about Ouster gaining further recognition based on its financial performance in 2024. My price target remains $12 by the end of 2024, aligning with the details outlined in the write-up from November.\nPrice Results for Lidar Companies Since Q3 2023 (SA, Author)\nThe market cap snapshot for the group:\nLidar companies Market Capitalization (Yahoo Finance, Author)\nThe financial details of the industry can be found in my Q3 review.
