        "raw_content": "Account\nThis S\u2019pore startup makes tech devices for kids \u2013 sold over 1M products across\u00a027\u00a0countries\nWhen G-Jay Yong\u2019s daughter, Ru Faye, turned two back in 2017, she grew fascinated with his Canon DSLR camera. She wanted to take photos with the heavy device, just like her father did.\nBut letting a kid handle a DSLR weighing 2kg is a surefire way to injury (and an expensive one at that), so G-Jay went to hunt for alternatives for his daughter.\nHe wanted to give Ru Faye her own personal digital camera with similar functionality as the DSLR, but G-Jay was left dismayed. He couldn\u2019t find anything that would suit children in the market.\n\u201cThere were either \u2018grown-up\u2019 cameras, or toys with blinking lights that can\u2019t take decent pictures,\u201d he lamented.\nThe lack of kid-friendly tech (KidsTech) in the market doesn\u2019t just stop at cameras \u2014 there are many other tech gadgets that are not suited for kids, despite the fact that children can greatly benefit from them.\nWe all live in a digital world and all the tech around us is designed for grown-ups. But what about younger ones? Our kids?\nSeeing a massive gap in the market, G-Jay decided to launch myFirst to provide children access to a safe and accessible digital world.\nCreating a KidsTech ecosystem\nmyFirst is G-Jay\u2019s third business venture. He started up his first company while he was still studying at the National University of Singapore, which had brought in a revenue of US$80 million.\nHis second venture was a business-to-government (B2G) startup which has since exited. Through that venture, he got acquainted with Brian Tan, who was an investor in his startup and the current co-founder of myFirst.\nBootstrapping their way forward, the 41-year-old duo launched their first product in 2018: a kid-friendly digital camera.\nBy 2019, the duo had launched a full suite of devices, including watchphones (a smartphone and smartwatch hybrid), audio devices and 3D pens, effectively creating a \u201cKidsTech ecosystem\u201d.\nSome of these devices come with connected services, such as messaging, voice and video calls, GPS and health monitoring, as well as unlimited data connectivity.\nParents can keep an eye on their kids\u2019 location and geo-fence with advanced GPS, WiFi and GSM for accurate positioning, and connect with them anytime with messages, voice or video calls.\nIn case of emergency, an SOS button will alert parents \u2014 they will know that their kids are safe and are contactable anytime, anywhere.\nmyFirst\u2019s product ideas are inspired by the co-founders\u2019 kids\nWhen developing myFirst\u2019s products, G-Jay proudly admits that the duo\u2019s kids were \u201cthe product managers\u201d of the company.\nIn fact, most of the company\u2019s product ideas are inspired by their kids.\nIt\u2019s quite amazing when we involve our kids in the design process \u2014 they actually enjoy the progress. My daughter is involved quite a bit in the brain storming process, design, colour selection, and features of our products.\nThis year, myFirst officially launched myFirst Circle, the world\u2019s first safe call, messaging, location and social sharing platform specially designed for kids, their friends and family to stay connected.\nThe app allows kids to safely share social posts on the platform for their friends and family to see and has group chat functions, among other features.\nThe idea behind myFirst Circle initially came to G-Jay and Brian back in 2020 during the pandemic.\n\u201cWhen COVID-19 hit in 2020, [we spent a year] working from home and lots of time with our kids.\u00a0This gave us the opportunity to understand deeply the needs kids have in staying connected with not just the family, but with their classmates,\u201d he explained.\nHence, G-Jay and Brian cooked up the platform as a way \u201cfor kids to stay connected socially, without the usual ills of social media\u201d.\nIncreasing the awareness on safe tech devices for kids\nAs a first-mover in the KidsTech industry, G-Jay admits that it had not been easy to market something that is completely new. Convincing retailers to carry their products was challenging, as they did not recognise that there was a need for KidsTech in the market.\n\u201cThere\u2019s EdTech, STEM, wearable tech, and even smart toys, but the market never specifically had a tech category catered for kids,\u201d said G-Jay.\nBut after finally persuading large retailers in various countries, the demand for myFirst\u2019s products gradually picked up.\nWherever we go, people are pleasantly surprised as they\u2019ve never seen a company focused on KidsTech, but they immediately understand the gap in the market of fun devices, safe services and socially connected families.\nHowever, as the awareness surrounding safe, tech devices for kids grew, the demand for myFirst devices also grew \u2014 at a much faster pace than G-Jay and Brian could handle. To keep up with the rapid growth, the duo had to seek external funding, eventually raising US$2.2 million in mid-2022.\nCurrently, the company has sold more than a million KidsTech devices, and has a presence in 27 countries, including Singapore, Japan,\u00a0South Korea,\u00a0the United States of America,\u00a0United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom.\nAlthough the company initially targeted expansion in developed countries with similar economic capabilities as Singapore, such as Japan and South Korea, myFirst pivoted their business strategy after receiving inquiries from less developed countries.\nParents all around the world are willing to spend on their kids as they recognise the difference between real tech and toys.\nHence, the company is shifting its focus to countries with a higher population of children, such as Vietnam, Indonesia and Thailand. To bolster its expansion efforts, my First is also currently looking to raise its next round of funding.\nBuilding a safe and suitable digital world for the next generation\nAlthough there are qualms on the impacts of tech on children, G-Jay firmly views that children can reap significant benefits from tech at an earlier age, given how tech is intertwined in almost every aspect of our daily lives.\nFrom using it for educational purposes in school, to wanting to mirror their parents who utilise tech everyday, exposure to tech is unavoidable for children in today\u2019s day and age.\nIf kids are not allowed any exposure to tech, but yet all they see around them are grown-ups and their peers using tech, it would most likely feel tempt them and could spell trouble once they are allowed access. It could be really easy for them to over-immerse themselves and get addicted to their devices.\nThis is why he finds that allowing kids to use tech with guidance and advise is a good way to help them utilise tech in a healthy way. By doing this, parents essentially build trust and respect with kids, teaching them to use their devices with self control and discipline.\nWith myFirst\u2019s devices, G-Jay hopes to build a safe and suitable digital world for children all over the globe.\nFeatured Image Credit: myFirst\nUnlock the knowledge of Asia's tech landscape\nSubscribe to our premium content for just S$99.90 a year.\nMonthly Package\nS$9.90 / month(or S$0.33 / day)\nGain access to all Vulcan Post Premium content for S$9.90 per month.\nAnnual Package\nS$99.90 / year(or S$0.27 / day)\nGain access to all Vulcan Post Premium content for S$99.90 per year.\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nStay updated with Vulcan Post weekly curated news and updates.\nMORE FROM\nVULCAN POST\nEntrepreneur\nEntrepreneur\nEntertainment\nLifestyle\nGadget & Product Reviews\nSingaporean\nNews Reader\nLifestyle\nInternational\nEdition\nVulcan Post aims to be the knowledge hub of Singapore and Malaysia.\n\u00a9 2021 GRVTY Media Pte.

Get social and join our safe, digital world for over 1 million kids, families, and friends.\nDesigned for kids, created for parents - by parents!\nIn 2017, the spark for myFirst ignited unexpectedly from a simple father-daughter moment. Our Founder & CEO G-Jay Yong found inspiration when his two-year-old daughter insisted on taking pictures with his Canon DSLR. Concerned about the weight of the 2kg camera, G-Jay set out to find a digital alternative that would match his daughter\u2019s enthusiasm.\nTo his surprise, the market offered no suitable solution. It was from this realization that led G-Jay to establish and the myFirst Camera was swiftly introduced, marking the beginning of a tech journey designed specifically for children. Thus, Ru Faye received her first ever camera and the myFirst KidsTech ecosystem was born.\nIt was not long after the launch of myFirst Camera that myFirst became the #1 Kid\u2019s Camera Brand in South Korea. Driven by a larger vision to be the first touchpoint for tech products in children\u2019s lives, myFirst has since diversified its offerings. With nearly 10 device categories, including watchphones, cameras, earbuds, 3D pens, sketch boards, and headphones, myFirst products are now available in over 36 countries.\nSince, G-Jay and our team of \u201cSuper Dads\u201d continue to embrace the entrepreneurial spirit, coupled with a commitment to enhancing children\u2019s interaction with technology, which has propelled myFirst into a global phenomenon. The need for their kids to engage more with new technology as the world is developing is more apparent than ever. The brand continues to thrive, connecting with families around the world and creating innovative, kid-friendly tech experiences for the next generation.\nmyFirst aims to enrich a child\u2019s learning process by moulding experiences through fun and innovative gadgets.
