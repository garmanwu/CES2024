Reviews ethics statement\nCES 2024 Health Tech: The Things That May Actually Improve Your Wellness\nFrom improvements in diabetes care to glasses that help you hear, here are the highlights from the world's largest consumer electronics show.\nThese Nuance Audio glasses look like a regular pair, but they're built to help you hear better.\nNew health and wellness technology can be an attractive sell because, well, who doesn't want to feel better? At CES this year, some of the new devices and concepts showcased marketed as a means to improve your health -- or at least make you look cool trying to do it.\nHere's a round-up of some of the best and most interesting health and wellness technology that's come out of\u00a0CES\u00a0this year so far. In similar news, read on for\u00a0futuristic concepts, products you can\u00a0already buy today\u00a0and our best of show picks\u00a0for 2024.\nA smart ring with a new edge\nThere's a new smart ring in town: the Evie health tracker. Made by Movano, it won CNET's admiration at CES this year, earning a spot in our best of show. In a world of smartwatches and wearables, what sets Evie apart is that it was designed with women's health in mind, from the fit of the ring itself to the way it interprets data in a holistic way. For more on the Evie ring -- including how comfortable it was to wear, how it tracked steps and more -- check out Bridget Carey's hands-on test of Evie on the CES floor.\nThe Evie ring and app are currently only compatible with iOS, with plans to support Android in the near future. You can order one now for $269 (in gold, rose gold or silver colors) with shipments expected later this month. Unlike Oura ring, there is no monthly subscription for an Evie ring -- just the one-time payment.\nAn all-in-one thermometer, stethoscope and heart health checker\nBeamO is a four-in-one health-scanning device.\nThe BeamO from Withings is a Wii-looking thermometer that does it all -- takes your temperature, checks your heart rate and blood oxygen levels, and even works as a stethoscope.\nDesigned to be easy to carry and light to hold, the BeamO is entering the market post-pandemic, where telemedicine visits are still the norm. But increasingly, patients want quick access to basic health information that providers may normally collect in-office.\nBeamO could help anyone who wants easy insights into their heart and lung health (and temperature, of course) monitor their baselines and share information with their health care providers. Following expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nGlasses that let you hear better\nThe Nuance Audio glasses can amplify the voice of the person you're speaking to.\nThe Nuance Audio glasses from EssilorLuxottica were made for people with mild or moderate hearing loss -- those who notice they have some trouble hearing in noisy, busy places. They have technology built right into the glasses frames that will amplify sound. To adjust the volume, users can tweak the glasses themselves or use the companion app. You'll also be able to add your vision prescription to the lenses.\nA pair of Nuance Audio specs will provide a different way for people to improve their hearing. Even now that the FDA is allowing over-the-counter hearing aid sales so people can get a hearing aid without a prescription,\u00a0high cost and perceived stigma of wearing hearing aids are still barriers to treatment for many people. (There's no official word on how much the Nuance Audio glasses will cost yet.)\nNuance Audio glasses are expected to be available in late 2024 in the US. They aren't a replacement for hearing aids, but EssilorLuxottica is registering them with the FDA as an over-the-counter hearing device.\nRead more: This Smart Bed Adjusts to Your Body With AI Sensors and Strings\nAn air conditioner for your neck\nA personal air conditioner that travels with you.\nTorras, which makes wearable air conditioners for your neck, announced a new model of its personal air condition at CES this year, the Coolify Cyber. While it's not a new concept this year (there are other models available for sale), it's the company's latest version of an air conditioning product that fits around the back of your neck to keep you cool -- not a bad choice for a hot day walking around, and one of the more approachable wellness items.\nIt works by running an electrical current between a semiconductor and a ceramic cooling plate that sits on your neck. CNET's Nick Wolny had a chance to test out the Torras' neck air conditioner, describing it as a positive experience that was \"a blast of cold air, but like a neck pillow that energized me.\"\nA toothbrush that tells you when you're doing it wrong\nThis year at CES, the Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush made its debut as a smart toothbrush that uses bone-conduction technology and an AI voice guide to give you tips on your brushing technique, including whether you're brushing too hard or focusing too much time in one part of your mouth. It has five brush modes designed for specific needs or times of the day and an interactive touch screen that can tell you where you missed a spot. The Oclean X Ultra will launch in the US this fall and costs $130.\nCES 2024: Kitchen Tech and Cooking Tools That Caused the Biggest Stir\nImproved diabetes tech\nA mold of the Mobi, Tandem's tiny automated delivery system.\nThe big diabetes device companies had a presence at CES this year, showcasing the latest improvements in technology for people with Type 1 diabetes. Last summer, Tandem\u00a0announced FDA clearance\u00a0of its Mobi insulin pump, the world's smallest automated insulin delivery system. And at the 2024 CES, the company brought it in for a showcase ahead of its anticipated launch early this year.\nAbbott and Tandem also just announced a US integration of Abbott's newest continuous glucose monitor, the\u00a0FreestyleLibre 2 Plus Sensor, with Tandem's T:slim X2 insulin pump.\nAt launch, the Mobi will be compatible with the Dexcom G6 sensor, with Dexcom G7 and Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor compatibility anticipated to follow, according to a press release.\nNew at-home smart UTI test\nVivoo's at-home urine tests pair with an app.\nUrinary tract infections (known as\u00a0UTIs) are a common reason for a trip to the doctor.\u00a0Vivoo, a health tech company that makes at-home urine tests with a partnered app, announced a new UTI test that gives users quick results that are stored on an app.\nVivoo said in a press release it's able to give UTI results through its \"deep learning image processing technology\" through its software.\nTo use it, download the Vivoo app first. Then, pee on the strip and scan it to get results on the app. Because it's stored on an app, you can easily share results with a health care provider to get a prescription or treatment.\nAt-home urine strips (even for UTIs) aren't new to DIY health care, but having a test available to people in partial app form can be useful for those who want more privacy or people who want to narrow down the cause of their symptoms. It also follows in the footsteps of other pee-based CES tech, like last year's toilet sensor from Withings.\nRead more: Anti-Snore Pillows at CES: This Smart Pillow Senses When You're Sawing Logs\nA wearable that's supposed to track your focus and agility\nThe Pison Ready wristband\nWe're all used to companies boasting their health-tracking and fitness-monitoring features, but what about how clear-headed and mentally sharp you're feeling? This year at CES, makers of the Pison Ready claim they can track just that.\nThe Pison Ready is made to measure metrics of mental focus, reaction time and agility through tests taken on your wrist, as demonstrated by CNET's Lisa Eadicicco. Pison Technology says it can zone in on your mental alertness by detecting neurological signals from the brain that suggest mental acuity. The company initially based its neural biosensing technology to benefit amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.\nThe Pison Ready launches in February and will be available as a subscription -- three months for $59, a year for $119 and two years for $199. It's not clear right now how practical it'll be for most people -- or how accurately it shows people's real-time ability to stay focused -- but the availability of a wearable that measures more heady wellness metrics, as opposed to more strict health metrics like blood oxygen or sleep stages, could potentially be an advancement in the wellness bubble in 2024.\nRead on for some of the wackiest tech at CES this year,\u00a0which robots we saw there, and the\u00a0most cutting-edge tech for 2024.\nOther Wellness Guides\nPersonal Care\nSleep\nFitness\nNutrition\nMedical and Mental Health"

This year\u2019s theme is Human Security for All, which emphasizes the critical role technology plays in making the world safer and more sustainable for everyone, encompassing topics from environmental protection to healthcare access and food security. With keynote conversations featuring leaders in technology, consumer goods and healthcare spaces, CES 2024 invites us to consider how we can come together to engineer solutions that solve global human security issues.\nIn the opening keynote, Siemens AG CEO Dr. Roland Busch will kick off these conversations by revealing how combining the real and digital worlds empowers manufacturers everywhere to transform the everyday, for everyone. Throughout the four-day event, we\u2019ll dive into the various ways that Siemens technology is helping our customers make the world more accessible for all, with one of the key areas being the medical device industry. Read on for a sneak peak of what awaits at CES and discover more ways that Siemens digital solutions are reshaping the medical device and healthcare industries.\nUnlimited Tomorrow: Breaking barriers in access to prosthetics\nOur booth at CES will highlight multiple customer success stories from across industries. One story we\u2019re excited to share comes from Unlimited Tomorrow, a manufacturer of personalized, affordable prosthetic arms.\nThe traditional process of creating prosthetic limbs is costly and can take up to a year. For users who are children and may still be growing, this process can leave them with a prosthetic that no longer fits at the time of delivery. Using Siemens NX software, Unlimited Tomorrow is able to drastically shorten the time it takes to create a prosthetic. Unlimited Tomorrow makes it easy for users to order a prosthetic from the comfort of their home using a scan app on a mobile device. Once the scans are received, Unlimited Tomorrow designs a man/machine \u201csocket\u201d to fit the prosthetic to the patient\u2019s partial arm, 3D prints the prosthetic and ships it to the customer. They typically receive their lightweight prosthetic arm five times faster than the traditional process.\nHow additive manufacturing is reshaping the medical device industry\nUnlimited Tomorrow isn\u2019t the only example of how additive manufacturing can be used to transform the medical device industry and elevate patient care with high-quality, durable products. Additive manufacturing makes it possible to easily develop custom prosthetics, implants and orthopedic surgical guides that are as unique as the patients they serve.\nSimilar to the process of producing prosthetics, custom orthopedic surgical guides can also be created from patient scans and developed individually. Surgical cutting guides are used to limit cuts to a specific area, allowing surgeons to make precise cuts when removing a diseased or injured area of a bone before inserting a replacement. Traditionally, surgeons would use patient scans to determine the position and location of the cuts, then estimate what size of cutting guide is necessary. During the operation, they would then make the final decision about the size and position of the guide, selecting from a collection of generic sizes.\nWith additive manufacturing and modern design software, surgeons can use the same patient scan data to mold the cutting guide\u00a0to the shape of the patient\u2019s bone and virtually place it in the exact position necessary to make the most precise cut. The end result? Less invasive surgeries and faster recovery times for patients.\nAdditive manufacturing is also broadening the types of implant materials available. Traditional implants used in procedures such as knee replacements are bonded to the bone using a cement adhesive. This adhesive will gradually weaken over time, often leading to an implant replacement later down the line. Several companies are now using metal-based lattice structures to promote bone growth into knee, hip and shoulder replacements.\u00a0Lattice structures are three-dimensional arrangements of a material at a small scale. They form a scaffold-type structure that is lightweight yet strong. Medical companies including LimaCorporate have designed lattice structures that can integrate directly with new bone growth when used as implants. Unlike cement, this bond actually grows stronger over time, leading to long-term durability.\nEnhancing digital health security\nMedical devices are becoming a daily part of our lives, whether it\u2019s a patient using a device that connects to their cell phone to help manage a chronic condition, or healthcare professionals managing healthcare workflows. These devices make our lives easier and more connected, but they collect sensitive information that must be handled carefully. In order to protect patient safety and confidentiality, it\u2019s imperative that medical devices are secured against bugs and cybersecurity vulnerabilities.\nSiemens Connected Care solutions equip medical device manufacturers with tools to improve the safety, quality and performance of their products. With our low-code application development platform, Mendix, and a robust cybersecurity framework, manufacturers can work collaboratively to build devices that enhance user experience and create apps for all forms of interaction \u2013 handheld to augmented reality. For the best user experience, our solutions improve device functionality and future-proof the software to ensure smooth upgrades.\nVisit Siemens at CES\nAre you attending CES 2024?

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

These technologies saw a massive increase in adoption from the COVID-19 pandemic, which raised important questions about access to healthcare, and made people around the globe more invested in their own health and wellness. However, despite the rapid adoption over the past half of a decade, the digital health solution market segment is still relatively nascent, with considerable room and opportunity to grow.\nThese emerging digital health solutions have the ability to give consumers control of their own health and wellness. This is a massive change for many consumers that are accustomed to a healthcare industry that mainly functions to treat illness when it happens and restricts access to care to those with health insurance, referrals, or geographic proximity to providers.\nWith seven out of ten consumers saying they\u2019re likely to adopt digital health solutions, organizers anticipate a massive increase in interest and demand for these solutions at CES\u2026\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that research from the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) found that 70 percent of consumers say they will likely use one or more digital health solutions in the future to improve their overall health or well-being. It\u2019s also not shocking that the use of telehealth among providers skyrocketed from 14 percent in 2016, to more than 80 percent in 2022, according to Healthcare IT News.\nWith seven out of ten consumers saying they\u2019re likely to adopt digital health solutions, organizers anticipate a massive increase in interest and demand for these solutions at CES, the world\u2019s preeminent consumer electronic showcase hosted annually by the CTA.\nThis year\u2019s event \u2013 which will take place in early January in Las Vegas \u2013 is the perfect venue to see some of the innovative digital health solutions entering the marketplace, and an incredible opportunity for solution providers to demonstrate exciting new digital healthcare capabilities. This is why healthcare technology companies such as Nuheara, CareWear Corp, Wearable Therapeutics, and Essence SmartCare attend CES.\nBut what overarching digital health trends will be on display at this year\u2019s show? And what are consumers looking for when analyzing and weighing investments in new digital health products and solutions? The CTA recently released a study entitled, Driving Consumer Adoption of Digital Health Solutions, that could enlighten health tech companies. Here are three factors that will impact digital health solutions at this year\u2019s CES:\nTaking control and becoming proactive\nAs we discussed, healthcare in much of the world for much of the past few decades has revolved around treating illness when consumers have symptoms of disease. Rarely have consumers had access to their own vitals and detailed information about their own health and wellness \u2013 often having to wait until they don\u2019t feel well and get sent by a doctor for a litany of expensive tests.\nThe COVID pandemic and emerging digital healthcare technologies have put a stop to that. People around the world are actively looking to take control of their health and become more proactive in their own wellness \u2013 trying to actively stave off disease and chronic illness with changes in behavior or routine.\nMoving forward, consumers are looking for these solutions to add increased functionality and capabilities, make health information more easily accessible, and increase the reliability of data\nThis has led to increased demand for Fitbits, smartwatches, and other wearable solutions that consumers can regularly use to monitor their overall health. According to the CTA\u2019s research, 73 percent of consumers report that these solutions help them feel more in control of their health, and encourage them to take better care of themselves. Additionally, 71 percent claimed that these solutions have raised their quality of life.\nMoving forward, consumers are looking for these solutions to add increased functionality and capabilities, make health information more easily accessible, and increase the reliability of data. Anticipate that the solutions being exhibited at this year\u2019s CES will deliver on many of these consumer requirements.\nIncreasing access for all\nAccording to CTA research, 59 percent of people have utilized telehealth appointments even with the pandemic in the rearview mirror. And there is a very good reason why telehealth offerings are so popular.\nWithin the U.S., in particular, there is limited access to healthcare among underserved populations. About 112 million people \u2013 approximately 40 percent of American adults \u2013 struggle to pay for healthcare. And, due to shortages in specialists and other healthcare professionals, and most healthcare providers concentrated around metropolitan areas, approximately live more than ten miles away from their nearest hospital. 18 percent of Americans live more than ten miles away from their nearest hospital.\nIt is imperative that underserved Americans can receive the healthcare they need.\nDigital health solutions \u2013 such as telehealth services \u2013 can help to overcome this challenge by offering a way to get health care without the need to go to an office or hospital building. This means more Americans can access quality healthcare and specialist care \u2013 including mental health services and addiction services \u2013 without ever leaving their homes.\nThis change in how we access healthcare services was the focus of a session during CES 2023 entitled, The Future of Care in America: A New Hybrid Model. In this session, visionaries from across the healthcare and healthcare technology industries explored ways in which technology is enabling a new model for patient care. You can watch that session in full in the video below:\nConsidering the historic challenges that Americans have faced in receiving and accessing care, it\u2019s no surprise that telehealth services and other digital health services remain in demand \u2013 and why they\u2019ll be featured prominently at the upcoming CES 2024.\nBringing it all together\nAnyone who has experienced the American healthcare system in the previous few decades understands how disjointed and disconnected it can be. A primary care doctor may refer a patient to a specialist, only to find that the results of previously conducted tests aren\u2019t available to them \u2013 requiring new tests to be run at the patient\u2019s expense. Or, a patient may find themselves answering the same questions repeatedly each and every time they see a different doctor or specialist.\nThe integration and sharing of healthcare data can open the door to incredible futuristic and beneficial capabilities.\nThis lack of connectivity and interoperability has made healthcare incredibly expensive and less effective. And for digital health solutions and services to truly reach their potential, information needs to be securely shared, and every system and source of healthcare data needs to interoperate.\nThe integration and sharing of healthcare data can open the door to incredible futuristic and beneficial capabilities. Doctors will be able to securely and remotely access and review the vital signs of a patient from the wearable that\u2019s monitoring them. AI will be able to analyze all available healthcare data and patient histories to identify illnesses and effective treatments in seconds rather than days or weeks.\nBut these capabilities are only possible if everything is integrated and interoperated. And this is why integration and interoperability will be two incredibly in-demand capabilities for digital health devices and services at CES 2024.\nCES is the home for digital health innovation that draws the most innovative companies that are breaking new ground in modern healthcare. Find out what\u2019s new as this field evolves, and what\u2019s next at CES 2024.\nRELATED\nPOSTS\nUnderfunded Hospitals Result in Reduced Access to Emergency Care\nHow AI is Revolutionizing Healthcare from Patient Experience to Operations and Cost Management\nAdvancing Healthcare IT: A Closer Look at Government Initiatives from the ONC, HHS, and VA\nTRENDING NOW\nThree Digital Health Trends to Watch at CES 2024\nDefense in Depth Strategy Protects Healthcare Organizations from Cyber Attacks\nUnlocking the Potential of Mentorship in Healthcare\nHealth-Seekers Level Up Self-Care with Gamification Apps\nAppalachian Regional Healthcare Transforms Machine Learning Insights into Improved Patient Experience\nCONNECT WITH US\nBECOME AN INSIDER\nI consent to having Future Healthcare Today collect my email and I agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\nStrategic Communications Group is a digital media company that helps business-to-business marketers drive customer demand through content marketing, content syndication, and lead identification.\nRelated Communities\nFinancial Technology Today\nGovernment Technology Insider\nModern Marketing Today\nRetail Technology Insider\nToday\u2019s Modern Educator\nQuick Links\nBecome a Sponsor\nFuture Healthcare Today offers content and advertising sponsorships to leading healthcare solution and service providers.

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nMonitoring People's Health Was A Notable Theme At CES 2024\nNew tech devices for health-monitoring populated the aisles of CES 2024.\nLast week, I mentioned in my Consumer Electronics Show columns that this January show was my 49th winter CES. In a small way, I have become a historian of this event. That has led people who know about my history of attending the show to ask how CES has evolved since I first attended it in the late 1970s.\nWhen I first went to CES, the focus was on VCRs and large hand-held video cameras. It even had a shady side, as the early adopters of VCRs were the adult entertainment industry. Many vendors who had new VCRs and video cameras to hawk, and even unrelated product companies would hire Playboy and Penthouse models and even porn stars to sign autographs in their booths to attract buyers. Interestingly, this was the origin of the \"booth babes\" term that was part of the CES vernacular until the show banned this practice in the late 1980s after it received significant criticism for this practice. This era was decades before flat-panel TVs and the more advanced technology we see at the show today.\nHowever, its evolution in the past 10 years has made CES a catchall show in tech that now includes smart cars, smart homes, health and fitness, advancements in televisions, streaming video, high-end gaming and just about anything that has a tech angle to a product or service.\nHowever, the one new area that CES has focused on that is a huge deal is the area of health, fitness and, more importantly, health monitoring.\nClose to 100 booths and private rooms showed products in this category. I admit that as I age, health, fitness and health monitoring have become more important to me, but it is an area that everyone should be interested in to stay healthy and fit.\nWith that in mind, here are a few of the products I saw this year that got my attention.\nWithings BeamO\nDemocrat Goldman Introduces Censure Resolution Against GOP\u2019s Stefanik For Calling Jan. 6 Defendants \u2018Hostages\u2019\nGovernment Shutdown Deadline Expected To Move To March\nEnroll Now For Early Student Loan Forgiveness, Says Biden: How To Apply\nDigital health company Withings announced its BeamO \"multiscope,\" a device that can perform four health checks in under a minute.\nThe BeamO fuses the capabilities of a thermometer, electrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope in an at-home checkup device. It is a multiscope that can do more than a fitness watch.\nBeamO combines these specialized sensors to turn their device into a powerful tool for regularly monitoring heart and lung health. It is portable and smaller than a smartphone.\nBeamO's design is to help individuals and families perform at-home checkups and substantially improve the quality of telehealth visits.The aim is to let people do more tests at home and talk to doctors on remote calls about the results, advancing the efficiency of telemedicine.\nStelo by Dexcom\nI have been a Type 2 diabetic for 27 years and have to monitor my blood sugars constantly. I am also insulin-dependent and use the Dexcom G7 CGM to help me determine my insulin dosages. Dexcom has now launched a new product that should be available later this year called the Stelo.\nWhat's different about the Stelo is its design for Type 2 diabetes patients who don't need insulin. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% or more of diabetes cases, yet these people don't always have a clear idea of which foods spike their blood sugar and what to do about it.\nFor someone on insulin, knowing their blood sugars is a life-and-death issue. For those not using insulin, learning about their blood sugars and how certain foods impact their blood sugars is a health issue that can help prevent their diabetes from getting worse. Abbot has a similar product called the Lingo Glucose Monitoring Biosensor. Both are essential tools for people with diabetes to manage this disease proactively.\nUltraHuman Smart Ring Air\nThere were many smart rings at the show, but the UltraHuman Ring Air is the only smart ring that uses fighter jet titanium that I have tested that monitors sleep, movement, recovery, nutrition and many fitness tracking data points. It has a six-axis motion sensor delivering accurate data and is water-resistant at a depth of 330 feet. I met with them at the show and was allowed to test it during CES. I found the sleep data better than the fitness tracker I wore at the show, and its step counter was very accurate.\nVivoo\nVivoo is a home testing tool that uses urine to diagnose nine important health-related data points. The company calls it a wellness platform that gives real-time data on water, magnesium, calcium, vitamin C, PH, keytones, sodium, oxidative stress and protein. A one-time purchase, which includes four Vivoo tests, is $39. They also offer monthly subscriptions for people who want or need to test more often to monitor these data points regularly.\nThis test highlights this new category of home health monitoring that has emerged to allow people to be more proactive in managing their health. This category includes smartwatches, fitness trackers, etc. Indeed, I saw at least 25 new smart health watches, fitness trackers and other health monitoring devices, including highly portable blood pressure tools and other health-related wearables.\nAlthough many dedicated medical shows have highlighted these health monitoring products, CES has become the leading consumer technology show in North America, where health has become a significant focus of this yearly event."

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nCES 2024 Preview: Innovations In Wearables And Health\nCES logo\nCES 2024 takes place from January 9 to January 12 in Las Vegas. It\u2019s a giant technology show where innovations across consumer and health tech are shown off.\nMore than 115,000 people came to the show in 2023, and 2024 is set to be even larger according to the official stats.\nThere will be plenty of surprises at the show, but some of the health tech and wearable-related tech there is already known. And there are clues as to some bits that have not been officially announced. Here are some of the most notable examples.\nWithings: Eye catching innovation?\nYou can hope for something intriguing from Withings, even if it will not appear on sale all that soon. At CES 2023, Withings showed the U-Scan, a headline-grabber of an announcement. The U-Scan is a urine analysis sensor designed to be mounted inside your toilet bowl. It can measure ketones, Vitamin C levels, water composition and acid base. One year on it\u2019s still listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on the Withings website. It has teased something equally compelling may be at CES 2024, tweeting \u201cthe dawn of our next revolution is imminent\u201d on December 22.\nFitbit: Luxe 2?\nWhile there is no major suggestion Fitbit has bit launch plans for CES 2024, there are some signs a Fitbit Luxe 2 is on the way. A wearable that, assuming there are no brand new lines in the works, must be either the Luxe 2 or an Ace 4, has passed through the FCC. Such a watch is likely to appear at some point in Q4 2024. However, will it come to CES? That is much less clear. The Fitbit Luxe arrived in 2021. And Fitbit has not seen many launches since Google\u2019s acquisition of the brand in January 2021.\nSo When Is The\nRebel Moon\nR Rated Snyder Cut s Release Date Then\nMassive California Waves Hospitalize At Least Eight And Cause Evacuations Along Pacific Coast\nThree Supermoons, Two Comets And The \u2018Great American Eclipse:\u2019 The Sky In 2024\nSamsung: Fit 3 incoming\nThe Samsung Fit 3 leaked in November and is expected to launch in January. It's more likely to be seen as part of confidential meetings at CES than a major public announcement, though, as Samsung will hold one of its big Unpacked events on January 18. That\u2019s just a few days after CES closes up shop. The watch\u2019s predecessor, the Galaxy Fit 2, arrived way back in 2020. This one has a much larger OLED screen, which should make it feel more like a smartwatch.\nRuah: Easier sleep apnea diagnosis\nRuahlab Inc.\u2019s Ruah wearable has received an innovation award from the CES CEA organisation even before the show begins. From a glance it looks a bit like a face mask worn only over the nose. However, it\u2019s an AI-powered device that monitors breathing patterns, in order to help diagnose sleep apnea. As such, it\u2019s a much more convenient alternative to polysomnography, which uses a multi-sensor polysomnogram to assess sleep abnormalities.\nAbbott: Glucose monitoring\nAccording to Wareable, Abbott plans to show its consumer-focused Lingo continuous glucose monitor tech at CES 2024. This means we could be getting closer to an expansion into the US. Lingo is already available in the UK, where it costs \u00a3150 (around $190) a month and is sold as \"the future of metabolism ownership.\u201d Lingo involves wearing a biosensor to monitor for glucose spikes.\nInception Lab: Bedsore diagnosis\nInception Lab is another winner of a CES innovation award. Its work is in the healthcare industry, but is a technology anyone can understand. It has made a bedsore sensor called Inception One. They are placed in \u201careas suspected of bedsores\u201d in order to help diagnose the problem without relying simply on a visual inspection.\nYou can expect news at CES to start pumping out from January 7, one of two \u201cMedia Days\u201d ahead of the show\u2019s opening."
