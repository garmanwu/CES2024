This followed a significant drop in the company's net income.[10][11]\nIn 2018, OSIM applied to be listed in the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. However, the plan was aborted due to perceived intense volatility in the market.[8]\nIn 2021, OSIM was recognized by Deloitte as one of the Best Managed Companies in Singapore.[12] Also in 2021, OSIM expanded to new product categories such as in beauty and gaming.[5]\nIn March 2022, OSIM International, under the V3 Group, filed for listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.[8]\nProduct Categories[edit]\nAmbassadors[edit]\nAwards[edit]\nExtension Programs[edit]\nReferences[edit]\nExternal links[edit]"

To receive this international award amongst our distinguished global peers validates the efforts of our team to continuously explore the boundaries of innovation in health and well-being,\u201d Ms Lynn Tan, Deputy CEO of OSIM International.\n\u201cWith this particular product, we looked to realise the benefits of Internet of Things (IoT) technology to deliver more intuitive, responsive, and impactful products. Not only have we been able to achieve that with the Smart DIY Massage Chair, but we have also been able to heighten accessibility to well-being devices for more individuals, as users can now gain a holistic stress-relieving experience by simply syncing two separate devices into one seamless fullbody experience.\u201d\nAs we continue building on OSIM\u2019s core mission to deliver holistic and meaningful well-being experiences for a diverse range of users, constant innovation in design and technology forms a critical component of our ongoing commitment to support users in their unique wellbeing journeys.\u201d\nThe Smart DIY Massage Chair comes to life through OSIM\u2019s proprietary mobile app, which enables users to customise their full-body massage experience.\nRecognised by CES for outstanding technological innovation, the OSIM Smart DIY Massage Chair is an IoT device that caters perfectly to the new norm of hybrid work arrangements and the doubling up of spaces. It delivers flexibility, customisation and performance at home, in the office, or any other space in which users choose to take their devices along for a quick pick-me-up.\nIt delivers a harmoniously integrated and customisable full-body massage experience through the combination of two powerful standalone devices \u2013 the uJolly 2 Smart back massager and uSqueez 2 Smart leg massager. The accompanying proprietary OSIM Smart DIY Massage Chair app allows users to synchronise the devices\u2019 functions to create a fully integrated massage chair experience.\nHive 2.0: The Future of Retail Innovation Unveiled at Esplanade Xchange\nThe app syncs both devices and features up to 24 unique combinations of full-body massage programmes that combine both back and leg massagers, or a mix-and-match of both devices\u2019 programmes. Both devices are equipped with OSIM\u2019s advanced massage technology, with Enhanced Dual-Action V-Grip Technology and realistic reflexology massage techniques to target and soothe tense muscles.\nAs more individuals look for intelligent and effective wellness solutions that can be used from the comfort of their own homes, it is evident that the application of frontier technologies to deliver flexible, intuitive, and effective products to alleviate modern day stressors is fast becoming an industry standard.\nThrough innovative products that address these rising levels of stress such as the Smart DIY Massage chair and the uDream, OSIM has achieved much international success in the fields of innovation, technology and design.\nAccruing various international accolades in the past year for excellence in product design, OSIM received its sixth Red Dot Design Award in March as well as the Design for Asia Award in August, both of which recognised OSIM for its outstanding design of the world\u2019s first well-being chair \u2013 the uDream.
