Valens\u2019 superior high-performance connectivity technology was highlighted through announcements and live demo stations. Check them out below.If you missed us at the show, we encourage you to contact us and a member of our team will be happy to address your questions.\nNEWS FROM CES 2024\nTOUR OUR DEMO STATIONS\nUnprecedented EMC Performance\nIn a head to head shootout with a competitor, we showed that Valens\u2019 high-performance chipsets are better withstanding noise. The setup includes a noise injector into the links and shows the competitor link failing while the Valens A-PHY link does not. Download the demo document to learn how we do it using our DSP-based approach to EMI.\nLearn more >\nPlay video >\nIndustry Leading Link Distance\nDemonstrating A-PHY Gear2, 4Gbps over 40 meters Coax (+3 inlines). Truly unparalleled bandwidth/distance combination in the industry. This will be applied to the truck and long vehicles market as well as other machine vision industrial applications. In Valens product roadmap, we have a dedicated derivative of the VA7000 chipset family for this mode (VA7021R, VA7004R)\nLearn more >\nPlay video >\nAdvanced Time Synchronization for Highest Precision\nThe VA7000 offers the most advanced time synchronization capabilities on the market, with extremely accurate clock and frame sync. Unlike other SerDes solutions currently available, the VA7000 includes a Pulse Width modulator (PWM) embedded within the deserializer. Our PWM is also extremely accurate, with less than 100 nanoseconds of jitter. This is a technology with real-life applications for safety-critical systems. And it\u2019s ready to hit the road.\nLearn more >\nPlay video >\nCentralized Processing for True Sensor Fusion\nThis demo stations is comprised of three demonstrations accompanied by an interactive screen that emphasizes what is required from the SerDes technology when transitioning to a centralized processing architecture.\nWe partnered with G-Pulse to demonstrate how together we deliver the fast controls required for the transition from edge to centralized processing. Leveraging the VA7000 chipset series by Valens, G-Pulse\u2019s radar is able to operate over UTP cables.\nLearn more >\nPlay video >\nProfessional Grade USB3.2 Extension\nValens Semiconductor\u2019s VS6320 provides extension of high-performance USB3.2 Gen1 peripherals at up to 100 meters/328 feet over category cable. It supports both USB3 (Superspeed 5Gbps) and USB2 (480Mbps), all types of USB transfer protocols (BULK, ISO, INT, Control), as well as dedicated control signals (UART, GPIO) over category cables. The VS6320 is set to comply with the\u00a0upcoming HDBaseT-USB3 standard.\nMIPI A-PHY Ecosystem\nThe MIPI A-PHY ecosystem has grown into a diverse, multi-vendor space, with companies throughout the automotive industry designing products based on this technology. And this future-proof, high-speed standardized sensor connectivity is what is now making the industry goal of centralized processing possible.\nThe MIPI A-PHY Ecosystem is presented through a comprehensive showcase of products.
