Here\u2019s how it works.\nVarjo Aero Review: What the Future Looks Like\nEnterprise VR technology trickles down to the consumer market.\nTom's Hardware Verdict\nIf having the best of the best is important to you and obscene price tags don't scare you off, the displays in the Varjo Aero are the best that we've ever seen in a VR device. It's also one of the most adjustable, and by extension comfortable, headsets that we've had through our lab.\n+ Ultra-clear display\n+ Adjustability\n+ Automatic IPD\n+ Standard USB-C cable\nHeadphones, base stations & controllers not included\nExpensive\nA little heavy\nWhy you can trust Tom's Hardware\nOur expert reviewers spend hours testing and comparing products and services so you can choose the best for you. Find out more about how we test.\nVarjo makes some of the most advanced VR hardware on the market, and just celebrated its fifth year in the business. But I'm willing to bet that unless you've been keeping a close eye on the VR industry, you've never even heard of the company. With price tags in the range of $5,000 to $10,000, it's unlikely that you would ever see one in a home. But the Varjo Aero is the company's first attempt to bring its hardware closer to the consumer market that is filled with great VR headsets.\nVarjo's new Aero headset borrows some of the features found in the company's flagship headset, the Varjo XR-3, but without the most expensive components. For example, it ditches the Lidar camera system and the micro OLED display to keep the price down. However, the Aero is still a pricey piece of technology. Only the most dedicated VR enthusiasts would likely be interested, and only the affluent among us could even consider it.\nVarjo is positioning Aero as an enterprise device that would also be suitable for hardcore simulation fans. If you\u2019re looking for a headset to play Beat Saber with, this is probably not the best option.\nVarjo is asking for \u20ac1,990 for just the Aero headset, and you would still need SteamVR basestations and controllers on top of that. At that price, only the Pimax 8K X is even in the same ballpark, but it still sells for several hundred less. You could buy a whole Pimax 8K X kit, with base stations, controllers, the upgraded head strap with speakers and a fiber optic cable for the same price.\nHeadset Specifications\nSystem Requirements\nThe Varjo Aero is, on paper, the most demanding VR headset that we\u2019ve ever tested. The minimum requirements call for a quad-core processor paired with 32GB of memory. The memory requirements are a soft-limitation, though. We ran the headset on a 16GB system without trouble.\nVarjo\u2019s software also requires an Nvidia-based GPU. AMD drivers are not currently supported and Varjo does not comment on future plans, so it\u2019s not clear if Radeon cards will ever be compatible.\nMeet the Varjo Aero\nThe first thing that stood out to me about the Varjo Aero when I opened the box was the overall quality. You would expect the Aero to feel and look like a top-end piece of hardware with such a high price tag. Still, the device caught my eye before it even came out of the box.\nThe visor of the Varjo Aero is compact and sleek compared to some of the other headsets that we've tested over the years. The body of the headset is made of satin-black plastic, with a glossy plastic faceplate. The body also features a fabric-wrapped section that's not just for looks. The fabric stretches around an open frame, giving the internal components extra breathing room to keep them cool. There are also two vents on the bottom of the visor to help dissipate heat.\nA Step Up in Resolution\nThe Varjo Aero features two 2,880 x 2,720 pixel Mini LED displays for a total resolution of 5,760 x 2,720. To put that into perspective, a year ago the HP Reverb G2 with 2,160 x 2,160 pixels per eye was a big deal, and just a few months ago, HTC released the Vive Pro 2 with 2,448 x 2,448 per eye resolution, which we thought was an impressive improvement. Varjo's displays take things to another level altogether.\nThe Aero isn't the widest headset around, but it provides a respectable 115-degree field of view, which puts it on par with the Valve Index. Pimax's lineup of ultrawide headsets provides a much broader and slightly taller window into VR. Still, the image clarity that the Aero delivers is much better than even the flagship Pimax 8K X.\nProfessionally Calibrated Displays\nVarjo is the only VR headset maker currently using Mini LED LCD panels, which allows for extremely sharp images with excellent color reproduction. And because the company caters to design professionals, Varjo calibrates the displays at the factory with 99% sRGB and 95% DCI-P3 accuracy. What this means is the colors you see in the display are true to reality.\nThe mini LED LCD panels in the Aero comprise 2000 LEDs each, which Varjo said enables high contrast between colors. The high volume of LEDs also enabled Varjo to reduce the screen\u2019s latency by 5ms. Urho Konttori, a co-founder of Varjo, explained that the company\u2019s engineers developed a sequence that strobes the LEDs row by row. It doesn\u2019t impact visuals and won\u2019t cause additional strain on your eyes, but speeds up the time it takes to refresh an image on the screen.\nThese Screens are Bright\nOne of the biggest advantages of the Varjo Aero over other headsets (other than the resolution improvement) is the brightness of the displays. In bright, colorful VR environments, you would be hard-pressed to find a better VR device to experience the true beauty of the digital world.\nAmazing Color Performance\nThe Varjo Aero's displays perform best in vibrant, bright scenes. The details it revealed in Half-Life: Alyx made it seem like I was playing a new version of the game with more details I'd never noticed before. I had a similar experience with the Vive Pro 2 and Pimax 8K X, but the Varjo Aero seemed to make fine details stand out even more.\nI spent some time in Wevr\u2019s theBlu while testing the Aero and it felt like taking in a whole new experience. No other headset that I've tried made this old title feel so wonderful. The colors of the plant life and the details of the aquatic creatures in the Reef Migration scene stood out like never before. The same can\u2019t be said for the Luminous Abyss scene, though.\nSub-Par Black Level\nOne significant drawback of Aero\u2019s displays is the poor performance in dark environments. I wasn't expecting OLED-level black performance, but seeing the washed-out grey that was supposed to be black left much to be desired. Playing The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners in the Varjo Aero is not the best experience. I found it difficult to discern some details because the environment should be darker than it appears.\nWhen pressed about the issue, Varjo said that it plans to enable local dimming in the future, but that feature is not currently available in the version of Varjo Base that accompanied our review sample. Urho Konttori explained that the current iteration of the local dimming driver introduces image artifacts. He said the company\u2019s engineers are working on a fix, but was reluctant to share a time estimate for its availability.\nAdvancements in Ergonomics\nThe Aero headset includes the advanced head strap that Varjo developed for its flagship product, the XR-3, which shipped early this year. The mechanical strap provides three different adjustment points to help you dial in comfort and fit. The rear of the head strap has a mechanical dial to adjust the size, which has become a standard feature on high-end VR headsets. The other two adjustments are not typical features, but they are welcome just the same.\nThe Varjo Aero includes a forehead adjustment strap. We've seen VR headsets that use your forehead for balance, such as the Vive Cosmos and the PlayStation VR, but this is the first device that we've tested that included a dial to fine-tune things at the front. The Varjo headset also provides a visor angle adjustment dial, which allows you to position the visor at exactly the right angle for your eyes. The top dial helps you bring the lenses up to the right height for your pupils, and the angle adjustment helps keep the face cushion positioned perfectly over your forehead and cheeks.\nThe face cushion, forehead cushion, and rear cushion are all made of moisture-resistant synthetic leather, which is easy to wipe clean when you're done with it. The rear and forehead cushions are mounted to swivels, which help align the cushion with the exact contour of your head. Surprisingly, the Varjo cushions only have foam stuffing along the edges. The central portion is wide open behind the PU leather material, which reduces the surface area that can absorb sweat and allow more airflow to dry it off faster.\nCalling These \"Advanced Features\" Is an Understatement.\nThe Varjo Aero headset has a unique set of lenses, unlike any other lens we've seen in a VR device. The central portion of the lens is convex, and the lens structure is smooth, with no steppings like you would find on Fresnel lenses. Varjo's lenses don't produce the refractions known as god rays. Along the perimeter of each lens, you'll notice a large black reflective lip, which hides the illuminators from Varjo's proprietary eye-tracking system.\nYou won't find an IPD adjustment dial on the Varjo Aero, not because it doesn't offer IPD adjustment, but because it doesn't need your input to calibrate. The IPD adjustment system is attached to motors, which automatically adjust to the ideal position for your pupils.\nIt's a bit freaky to witness the lenses move side to side when you first plug in the Aero.\nPowered by a Single Cable\nA few years ago, Nvidia, AMD, and the big VR headset makers banded together to develop a data cable standard for VR devices that would leverage the capabilities of the USB Type-C and the bandwidth of USB 3.1. Sadly, that partnership and its plans fell apart before it saw the light of day, but Varjo took the idea and emulated it to a degree.\nThe Varjo Aero runs off of a single 5-meter long USB Type-C cable, which should be easy to replace. The cable plugs directly into the top of the visor, with a small recessed area to keep the plug snug and secure.\nThe computer end of the tether cable also terminates in a Type-C connection. However, it does need to plug into a breakout box that includes a USB 3.0 connection, a DisplayPort connection, and a barrel plug port to receive power from the wall.\nWhat's Not Included?\nThe Varjo Aero is the most expensive VR headset that we've experienced to date. And to add insult to injury, it's not even a fully equipped device. These days, most VR headsets include a built-in audio solution. That could be headphones or speakers mounted close to your ears. Varjo's headset does not include a built-in audio system. You'll find a 3.5mm audio jack on the left side of the visor for your earbuds or headphones, though.\nThe Varjo Aero is a SteamVR headset, which means you need a pair of SteamVR basestations to make it work. Varjo does not include the base stations with the headset. You also won't get a pair of controllers with the Aero. The headset can pair with any SteamVR controller, such as the Vive wands, Valve Index controllers, or Pimax's upcoming Sword controllers. Varjo does not make its own input device.\nOn the bright side, the Varjo Aero doesn't come with a subscription fee like its predecessors. Varjo has traditionally charged an annual license in addition to the cost of its headsets, but the company is dropping that requirement to attract deep-pocket enthusiasts in addition to businesses.\nSteamVR, but not SteamVR\nThe Varjo headset does not integrate natively with SteamVR, though it does interface with SteamVR. What that means is the headset uses the SteamVR drivers to run the lighthouse tracking system, but you can't use the guardian system, and you can't open the Steam menu in VR to launch games.\nThe Varjo Aero is equipped with SteamVR 2.0 tracking sensors, which gives it room-scale tracking, but Varjo's drivers do not support the guardian system, so you must configure the headset in standing-only mode. On the bright side, configuring the headset that way makes it easy to calibrate your position to access your keyboard and mouse or a peripheral for a simulation game.\nVarjo made the setup procedure as easy as you could imagine. The automatic IPD kicks in as soon as you put the headset on. The integrated eye-tracking system measures your pupil position, and motors inside the visor move the lenses to match your eyes. When you first put the headset on, you will be asked to look at a dot in the center of the screen for a few seconds to lock in your eye position.\nAlmost a Monitor Replacement, But Not Quite\nThis is the only headset that we\u2019ve tested that has provided the image clarity required for regular productivity work. I wore this headset to write much of the article, review the benchmark results, and build my performance charts. If the headset were half the weight, I could imagine wearing this for many hours.\nAs it stands, Aero is suitable for shorter stints of no more than a couple of hours, but not all-day use. The screens are very impressive, but they still leave my eyes a little bit strained because the text clarity is not quite perfect when working in productivity tools like word processing software.\nThe Varjo Aero is not quite comfortable enough to be an all-day headset. The triple adjustable headband makes dialing in comfort quite a breeze, but the headset is still way too heavy to stay comfortable for long. The Aero is one of the heaviest headsets that we've ever tested, which is a big surprise considering the recent industry trends towards lightweight devices.\nThe extra weight is one of the prices you pay to have all the bells and whistles included. One thing we should note: During our many hours of continuous testing, the headset showed no signs of overheating. It didn\u2019t even feel warm to the touch. The internal cooling system does its job nicely.\nTest Setup\nAs usual, we performed our testing on our long-running VR test machine, although this test nearly required a small upgrade. The system includes an Intel Core i7-8700K, 16GB of G.Skill DDR4-3600, and an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080. The minimum requirements for the headset call for 32GB of memory, but 16GB proved sufficient to get by, except for a photogrammetry demo that Varjo provided with the headset.\nThe Varjo Aero is not the type of headset that you would buy to play Beat Saber. We focused our attention on simulation games because Varjo believes that simulation enthusiasts are the consumer segment most likely to invest in an Aero.\nWe tested Project Cars 2 and Star Wars: Squadrons in addition to our standard test suite, which includes Beat Saber, Pistol Whip, Half-Life: Alyx, and Shadow Legend VR.\nPerformance Tests\nBeat Saber\nThere\u2019s not much to say about Beat Saber in the Varjo Aero. The increased resolution doesn\u2019t do anything to improve the experience in this game. The beat cubes look much sharper than they do in other headsets, but that\u2019s of no benefit to the player.\nIf anything, the Varjo Aero delivers an inferior experience in Beat Saber compared to some other headsets because the refresh rate is locked to 90Hz.\nPistol Whip\nPistol Whip is another game that benefits greatly from increased frame rate and has no real advantage when run in higher resolutions. The Varjo Aero makes Pistol Whip\u2019s maps look sharper, but that won\u2019t help you land more shots.\nOur test system didn\u2019t have any trouble keeping the framerate up and the frametimes low, even with the Aero\u2019s extraordinary display resolution.\nHalf-Life: Alyx runs best when you can achieve high frame rates, but this solo FPS game is more forgiving than some titles with framerate dips. That said, the RTX 2080 in our test system held its own and delivered smooth gameplay and consistent framerates.\nCompared to the Vive Pro 2, the Varjo Aero suffered slightly increased frametimes, but our GPU still managed to keep the latency below 16ms even in the worst case. It usually hovered around 8ms, whereas the Vive Pro 2 demonstrated less than half the latency.\nShadow Legend VR\nShadow Legend VR looks absolutely incredible with the Varjo Aero. The excellent clarity that the high-resolution mini LED panels provide is a real sight to behold. The increased brightness that these screens put off makes the bright world come to life.\nThis game gave our RTX 2080 a bit of a run for its money. The game performed acceptably well, but the CPU frametime peaked at 12ms and we could tell the PC was giving it all it\u2019s got to keep the framerate stable. We observed relatively low FPS in this title. A stronger GPU would almost be necessary to get the most out of this game with a Varjo Aero.\nProject Cars 2\nProject Cars is the type of game that really shows what the Varjo Aero is meant for. The incredible image quality brings details out of the cockpit that you simply can\u2019t see in most VR headsets.\nThis game proved to be too much for our test system, but the experience was still very enjoyable. The average framerate was roughly half the desired 90 FPS, and we had incredibly high latency with the median hovering around 17.8ms and worst-case topping out at 22ms. Incredibly, we didn\u2019t experience any level of motion sickness, despite the fact that not a single frame landed on time.\nStar Wars Squadrons in the Varjo Aero is a next-level experience. The detailed world that Motive Studios put together for this title is incredible to witness in the Varjo Aero. The vivid displays make the color pop and make you feel like you\u2019re visiting a new world.\nLike Project Cars 2, Star Wars Squadrons demands too much from the GPU for our system to keep up. We would highly recommend a top-tier current-generation GPU if you want to play simulation games in the Aero. The performance fared better than Project Cars 2, but we still saw less than 10% of our frames land on time to keep the 90Hz displays fed.\nConclusion\nWithout a doubt, the Varjo Aero provides the clearest window into the digital world of any headset that I have yet tested. It isn't easy to convey the experience in words. But I was so impressed with the clarity that I immediately opened Google Docs and started writing the first draft of this review without taking the headset off. And while I wouldn't want to give up my monitors just yet, the Varjo Aero is the first headset that made me consider that forgoing traditional display panels may be a viable option in the not-too-distant future. And this headset doesn't even have Varjo's claim-to-fame Bionic Display technology, which would theoretically enable an even better visual experience.\nIf you have the money to afford a headset like this, and you're deeply passionate about VR gaming, I can't think of a better headset to consider. The only thing it's missing is an ultra-wide field of view, but as much as I love a wide field of view in VR, the clarity of Varjo's displays is far more impressive than the fuzzy peripheral vision you get in a headset with lower pixel density and wider screens.\nKevin Carbotte is a contributing writer for Tom's Hardware who primarily covers VR and AR hardware.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE).

Every aspect needs to be as realistic as possible: the digital twin of the Space Station, the physics modeling, and of course, the visuals. PaleBlue, together with the European Space Agency, has been training astronauts in XR to make sure that they are familiar with the international space station, the operations, and the team work involved in traveling to space. We have been testing the new Varjo XR-4 in this scenario and the mixed reality passthrough Varjo has achieved is remarkable. It allows for hyper realistic simulations of the ISS and we anticipate that it will unlock a next-level experience for astronauts in terms of training and mission preparation,\u201d said Felix Gorbatsevich, CEO of PaleBlue.\n\u201cIDSI has deployed more than 700 visual systems for simulation and training over 17 years, and our customers are pleased that we offer Varjo mixed reality solutions to augment their traditional training simulators. Varjo\u2019s new XR-4 series has the highest resolution displays which aligns perfectly with our I/ITSEC theme of \u2018replicating reality in a digital world\u2019. The high-resolution video pass-through of the XR-4 preserves the required ability for trainees to see and engage with physical devices that are tools of their trade, and the XR-4 Secure Edition is essential for ease of deployment in classified and secure environments that are common in our customer base. The Varjo XR-4 is ideal for a spectrum of mission rehearsals including fixed or rotary wing training, and our core market of JTAC training as it elevates and enhances trainee performance,\u201d said George Forbes, founder and CEO of Immersive Display Solutions, Inc.\n\u201cWith Varjo\u2019s new XR-4 series, training and simulation can move into the highest-immersion virtual and mixed reality environments. Varjo\u2019s unique ability to blend real and virtual seamlessly, combined with the significantly larger field of view and their highest-resolution displays in the XR-4 series, will allow us to scale and expand the use of these technologies into multiple military and commercial simulation programs at Cole Engineering Services, Inc. (CESI). With the new variable focus pass-through ability in the XR-4 Focal Edition, pilots can train for the most demanding missions completely naturally and comfortably in mixed reality environments.\u00a0 We are excited about two additional enhancements,\u00a0 Varjo\u2019s inside-out tracking and integrated noise-canceling audio as both features add additional benefits by reducing the simulator setup time and eliminating the need for audio headsets. Together with Varjo, we look forward to providing advanced, high-security mixed reality simulators that have the potential to completely transform virtual training for our customers anywhere in the world,\u201d said Eric Carr, Program Director at CESI.\n\u201cBack in 2021, Varjo and Loft Dynamics made aviation history with the first EASA-qualified virtual reality flight simulators, making pilot training safer, more scalable, and sustainable. In the meantime, more than a thousand pilots have successfully undergone credited training and checking on Loft\u2019s qualified Flight Simulation Training Device (FSTD) using Varjo\u2019s headset. Also today, Loft\u2019s FSTDs using Varjo are the only VR/XR systems that fulfill the high quality and precision standards for pilot training, truly replicating what it feels like to fly in a real aircraft. With the launch of the new Varjo XR-4 series, we eagerly anticipate a quantum leap in our extended reality (XR) simulation capabilities, embracing the widest Field of View (FOV) and the pinnacle of resolution offered by these cutting-edge devices. Together, we\u2019ll further accelerate the rapid growth of immersive training globally with the most advanced solutions,\u201d said Fabi Riesen, CEO and Founder of Loft Dynamics.\nSee latest updates from Varjo\nJoin the Varjo XR-4 Series Consumer Waitlist\nCompany News\nNov 27, 2023\nWatch the Varjo XR-4 Launch Event On-Demand\nEvents\nNov 13, 2023\nHow W\u00e4rtsil\u00e4 Revolutionizes Maritime Training with Varjo\u2019s XR Technology\nCase Study\nNov 8, 2023\nSubscribe to newsletter\nGo to Varjo store\n\u65e5\u672c\u8a9e\nContact us\nVarjo HQ\nVuorikatu 20\n00100 Helsinki, Finland\nVarjo Tech USA HQ\n901 N Glebe Rd.\nSte. 500\nArlington, VA 22203\nCookie settings\nCopyright \u00a9 Varjo 2024.

        "raw_content": "Varjo XR-4 Series: Mixed Reality with Human Eye Resolution\nVarjo Releases XR-4 Series: High-Resolution VR/AR Headsets Targeting the Industrial Market, Promising Enhanced Visuals and Mixed Reality Experiences.\nAs testament to the potential of Varjo's XR technology, the US Army was set to use the Varjo XR-3 Focal Edition for its Reconfigurable Virtual Collective Trainer (RVCT) Air Program. The partnership aimed to enable mixed reality training scenarios for Apache, Chinook, and Black Hawk helicopter pilots. The headset provides pilots with a fully immersive training environment where they can interact with physical controls in real-time.\nIt is likely that this program, among others, will now move forward with the launch of the new generation of Varjo headsets.\nVarjo launches VR/AR headsets XR-4, XR-4 Focal Edition, XR-4 Secure Edition\nFinnish tech company Varjo has launched its latest XR-4 series headsets, offering virtual and mixed reality experiences that are said to be virtually indistinguishable from natural sight. The XR-4 series, which includes the XR-4, XR-4 Focal Edition, and XR-4 Secure Edition, merges high-resolution displays, advanced LiDAR depth sensing, and camera sensors to mimic human eye functions. Eye tracking enables automatic IPD adjustment and dynamic foveated rendering.\nThe Varjo XR-4 is designed to take Mixed Reality to the next level, says Varjo. | Bild: Varjo\nWhile consumer-grade headsets cater primarily to 2D productivity, Varjo's 4th generation headsets are designed to deliver immersive VR/XR experiences for industrial customers who require especially excellent visual fidelity and performance.\nShot-through video of Varjo XR-4 in training by Aechelon | Video: Varjo\nVarjo's XR-4 series is powered by Nvidia GPUs and integrated with Nvidia Omniverse, enabling developers and industrial users to render photorealistic scenes and use ray tracing in mixed reality.\nThe XR-4 series also supports a software ecosystem of over 100 third-party PC applications and 3D engines, including Unreal Engine and Unity. This integration allows the XR-4 series to integrate into workflows across various industries such as training and simulation, design and engineering, healthcare, and more.\nKey Features of the XR-4 Series\nThe XR-4 series comes with dual 4K \u00d7 4K displays (3830 \u00d7 3744 pixel per eye), offering a resolution of 51 pixels per degree (ppd) and a 50% wider field of view (120 \u00d7 105 degrees)\u00a0 compared to previous-generation devices. Unlike their previous professional headsets, Varjo has chosen not to use a dual display design.\nCheck your inbox or spam folder to confirm your subscription.\nOther key features include\nBeyond the basic XR-4, Varjo also offers the XR-4 Focal Edition and XR-4 Secure Edition. The XR-4 Focal Edition comes with gaze-directed autofocus cameras. They identify where the user is looking and automatically align the focal plane with the real-world objects that are integrated into the virtual environment through video pass-through. This results in a mixed reality display that replicates the natural focusing mechanism of the human eye.\nThe XR-4 Secure Edition, on the other hand, caters to government and defense customers, adhering to government and enterprise-level security requirements. Both the XR-4 and XR-4 Focal Edition offer versions of the headsets that can go completely offline, are TAA compliant, non-RF, and assembled in Finland.\nVarjo XR-4 Series: Pricing and Availability\nThe Varjo XR-4 will cost 3990 euros or dollars. The new headsets are available for enterprise orders immediately, with first shipments starting in December. The Varjo XR-4 Focal Edition will be available at the end of 2023 for 9990 euro or dollars. Both come with Varjo's Inside-out Tracking.\nAn auxiliary Enterprise-Pro package is available for companies, e.g, through Resellers like Schenker Technologies from Germany. This includes, for a price of 2,000 Euros (excluding VAT), priority shipping and a service-level agreement with 24-hour support, as well as a personalized introduction to the headset by Varjo. Furthermore, the Enterprise-Pro option allows for offline use of the Varjo XR-4 and does not require user account registration.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
