        "raw_content": "My Five Favorite Products From CES 2024\nI just got back from CES 2024, and what a week it was. I was able to spend four days in Las Vegas checking out the products and companies sharing news and showing off their wares. It was no small feat: There were upwards of 4,000 exhibitors at the show this year, spanning 12 venues and over two million square feet of exhibition space. My Apple Watch is very happy with my fitness activity.\nWhile I saw a ton of cool, unique, and weird tech during my time at CES, there were a handful of devices that truly stood out. Here are my five favorite products from CES 2024.\nLG OLED T\nThere were a lot of TVs at CES this year. Perhaps too many. Samsung showed off its micro-LED TVs, Hisense pushed its mini-LED displays, and everyone was trying to prove they had the biggest screens possible. (I believe Hisense took the cake with a massive 163-inch display.)\nBut it was an LG TV that impressed me most. It was impossible to miss, even if you skipped their press conference on Monday: The second you walked through the first entrance in the Las Vegas Convention Center, you'd walk straight into a massive wall of their OLED Ts.\nThe OLED T is possibly the coolest thing I've ever seen. That \"T\" stands for \"transparent.\" When shut off, the TV is essentially a clear glass box. However, turn it on, and the \"glass\" suddenly starts playing video, while remaining transparent. You can see right through it, but also watch your shows and movies. Is that practical? Not really, which is why a curtain on the back of the set can be raised to transform the T into a more traditional OLED TV.\nLG wasn't the only company to show off transparent display technology. Samsung had it too, as did companies like RCA and \"Dongwoo Fine-Chem.\" LG, on the other hand, made the biggest impression, in no small part thanks to that prime convention center real estate.\nSamsung Ballie\nI was first introduced to Ballie during Samsung's press conference on Monday, but the smart robot has been in the works since 2020. It's come a long way since then\u2014it used to look like an oversized tennis ball. Now it looks like an oversized tennis ball with wheels. In short, it's cute AF.\nBallie is meant to be a smart smart hub. That's not a typo: This little guy can analyze your home and adjust all your smart devices accordingly. You can check in on it from your phone and see your home through its eyes. Samsung's demo video showed Ballie checking in on your dog, for example, which I'd love if I wasn't confident Ballie would scare the crap out of my dog.\nBallie also has a built-in projector so it can display video on any surface in your home. You could project a workout video on the wall in a room without a TV, or a cooking video on the wall of your kitchen as you follow a recipe. It has quite the range, too, so it can display video on the floor or ceiling, whatever makes the most sense.\nDoes anyone need Ballie? Probably not. Does anyone need a transparent TV, either? Sometimes, things are cool because they're cool.\nColdSnap\nColdSnap drew a big crowd during CES Unveiled, and it's obvious why: free ice cream. But also, free ice cream that takes just two minutes to make. ColdSnap is what you'd get if Keurig made an ice cream maker: You pop a flavor pod into the machine, press a button, and after 120 seconds, out comes a bowl of ice cream.\nThe best part? It's actually pretty good ice cream. I don't know if it's \"the creamiest, best tasting ice cream available anywhere\" like the promo claims, but for what it is, I was seriously impressed. I tried the bourbon flavor, and it was great. (Unless that was the bourbon talking.)\nPawport\nAs a dog owner living in an apartment, I often think about how nice it'd be to have a dog door in my home\u2014specifically when I'm in the elevator at 11 p.m., taking the dog out to pee. While a typical dog door would be a huge quality of life increase, Pawport convinced me that a smart dog door makes a lot of sense, too. (It helps that the device fits over existing dog doors. Not that I have one. Sigh.)\nPawport works by opening the doggie door whenever it senses the accompanying Bluetooth device you attach to your dog's collar. You can choose how sensitive its rangefinder is, as well as how quickly the door opens, how far it opens, and how long it takes to close, among other options. You can also use the app to check some stats, such as how long your dog has been outside and how many times your dog has come and gone through Pawport.\nPerhaps most importantly, you can schedule when Pawport is functional and when it will close up shop if you don't want your dog running in and out of the house all night\u2014and the company assured me that it's a one-way lock, so if your dog is outside when the schedule kicks in, it'll still be able to get back inside. Plus, there's a built-in battery, so in the event of a power outage, your dog won't be stuck inside or out.\nXGIMI IMAX enhanced projector\nAs with TVs, I saw a lot of projectors this year. Many impressed me: One of Hisense's \"laser TV\" projectors has a rollable screen that lets you adjust the aspect ratio of your projection. One 4K 3D ultra short throw projector from AWOL Vision offered a fixed projector at the cinemascope aspect ratio (2.35:1), which means you won't have to deal with black bars when watching many widescreen movies.\nHowever, it was XGIMI's \"Horizon Max\" projector that intrigued me most. XGIMI has partnered with IMAX to offer the first \"IMAX enhanced\" long throw projector. The company dedicated an entire demo booth to showing off the tech, and wow. When the image switches from traditional 2.35:1 to the boxy IMAX ratio, it fills the wall with the movie you're watching. Of course, this effect will work best with movies shot in IMAX (Oppenheimer, anyone?), but I'm certainly keen on turning my home theater into an IMAX experience. That is, if I had a home theater.\nJake Peterson is Lifehacker\u2019s Senior Technology Editor. He has a BFA in Film & TV from NYU, where he specialized in writing.

        "raw_content": "5 new kitchen appliances at CES 2024: smart AI grills, no-clean ice cream, one-touch air fryers and more\nChef-like robots, AI-powered appliances and other hi-tech kitchen gadgets are holding out the promise that humans don\u2019t need to cook \u2013 or mix drinks \u2013 for themselves any more.\nThere was plenty new in the food and beverage world at CES 2024, the multi-day trade event in Las Vegas put on by the Consumer Technology Association. Displays included cocktail-mixing and ice-cream-making machines, and a robot barista whose movements were meant to mimic a human making a vanilla latte.\nHere\u2019s some of the newest tech that\u2019s transforming the way meals are prepped, cooked and delivered:\n1. Grill smarter\nUsing generative AI technology, Brisk It\u2019s new smart grill, the NeoSear, aims to make the art of barbecuing foolproof.\nYou can ask the grill all kinds of questions to create the perfect recipe, such as \u201cWhat seasoning should I add to make my chicken skewers spicy?\u201d and \u201cHow do I sear a medium-rare steak?\u201d\nOnce you\u2019ve nailed down a recipe and prepped the food, Brisk It\u2019s InnoGrill AI 2.0 technology will command the grill to cook it.\n\u201cIt\u2019s everyone\u2019s smart grill,\u201d said CEO Christopher Huang. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a skilled enthusiast, if you\u2019re busy, young or old.\u201d\nThe grill is not yet available but will cost around US$2,000, Huang said.\n2. DIY ice cream in a snap\nFreezing your own ice cream at home takes hours, but with tech start-up ColdSnap\u2019s no-clean ice cream machine, your frozen treat is ready in two minutes.\nChinese EV maker shows off flying car but admits urban use is far off\nChoose from flavours like salted caramel and coffee, then put the pod in the machine and it will dispense your cold treat in minutes after scanning the pod\u2019s QR code.\nColdSnap can also whip up frozen lattes, boozy ice cream treats and protein shakes.\n3. One touch is all it takes\nTech start-up Chef AI is unveiling what it calls a \u201creal one-touch\u201d air fryer.\nUnlike the air fryer you might have on your kitchen counter right now, Chef AI\u2019s iteration of the popular appliance doesn\u2019t require any tinkering with settings. Just place the food in the air fryer, press start, and it uses artificial intelligence to detect what type of food it is cooking, said Dean Khormaei, the company\u2019s CEO.\nHe added that the air fryer would turn even the worst cooks into chefs.\nChef AI\u2019s air fryer will be available in the US in September for US$250.\nTech giants Alibaba, ByteDance lead China\u2019s return to CES\n4. A \u2018no smoke\u2019 indoor smoker\nGE Appliances is looking to change the way you smoke food with its new US$1,000 indoor smoker.\nAround the size of a toaster oven or microwave, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker can fit a full brisket cut in half, 40 chicken wings or three racks of ribs.\nIt still uses wood pellets to achieve a smoky flavour, but its technology traps the smoke inside, making it \u201cperfect for people who live in urban environments\u201d such as high-rise apartments, said Whitney Welch, a spokesman for GE Appliances.\n5. Your own personal bartender\nWhat\u2019s the secret to a perfect dirty martini? Don\u2019t worry about it \u2013 Bartesian\u2019s cocktail-mixing appliance takes the guesswork out of bartending.\nBartesian\u2019s latest iteration, the Premier, can hold up to four different types of spirits. It retails for US$369 and will be available later this year.\nUse a small touch screen on the appliance to pick from 60 recipes, drop a cocktail capsule into the machine, and in seconds you have a premium cocktail over ice.\nIf you fancy a home-made beer instead, iGulu\u2019s new automated brewing machine lets you make your own beer \u2013 a pale ale, amber lager or wheat beer.\nJust pour a pre-mixed recipe into the machine\u2019s keg, add water and scan the sticker that comes with the beer mix. In nine to 13 days, you\u2019ll have 3.8 litres (one gallon) of DIY beer."

        "raw_content": "CNN values your feedback\nMarkets\nHot Stocks\nFear & Greed Index\nLatest Market News\nHot Stocks\nThis Keurig-like machine for soft serve ice cream is what the world really needs\nIt\u2019s a rocky road to disrupt the ice cream industry, but sundae you may get your soft serve from a pod.\nA new machine called ColdSnap, which looks and functions like a Keurig for soft serve ice cream, has emerged as one of the buzziest products of this year\u2019s all-digital CES tech show. At a time when much of the event, like much of our lives, is focused on ways to adapt to the pandemic, the ColdSnap offers the promise of something sweeter, on demand.\nThe system is marketed as taking shelf-stable, recyclable ice cream pods of varying flavors and freezing them in about 90 seconds before dispensing it into a cup or cone. The company is also working on pods for smoothies, frozen coffees, protein shakes, non-dairy ice cream and frozen cocktails, such as mud slides and daiquiris. The machine reads a QR code on top of the pod\u2019s label to find the specific freezing temperature for each product.\nThe product, which is only in the prototype stage with plans to launch in select locations in the second quarter of 2021 and ship direct to consumers early next year, falls under the where has this been all my life? category. But the price point is less sweet than the product: $1,000. (The company said it aims to eventually bring it down by half.)\nMatthew Fonte, the serial entrepreneur behind the product, said it\u2019s been a big undertaking to create pods that are safe, convenient (little cleanup), cost effective and sustainable; the pod containers are aluminum like a soda can. Keurig and other one-time use pod makers have long been criticized for the inability to recycle their products.\n\u201cThis is challenging and requires significant development and engineering expertise,\u201d said Fonte, who has a PhD in mechanical engineering from Tufts University. \u201cIn the beginning, a lot of people didn\u2019t think it was [scientifically] possible to create ice cream like this in about a minute or so.\u201d\nThe company says the machine simultaneously pulls heat from the pod, creating a cooling effect on the liquid ice cream mix, and engages a part within the pod that churns the ingredients during the cooling process. Air is sucked into the can to make the required loft in the ice cream.\nThe idea started years ago when Fonte and his two daughters grew tired of reading the same books at bedtime and decided to write in \u201cinvention journals.\u201d\n\u201cWe included new toys, toothbrushes and hoola hoops,\u201d he told CNN Business. \u201cOne day, they asked for an ice cream machine.\u201d\nHe explained ice cream machines for the home aren\u2019t typically efficient; many require a bucket to be frozen overnight, a consistent mixing process and are a mess to clean up. \u201cWhat about a Keurig machine for ice cream?\u201d one daughter asked.\nThe rest is histrawberry.\nFonte\u2019s background played a significant role in jumpstarting the process. He and his brother worked alongside their father, an Italian immigrant, for 20 years in a metal working business, producing rocket motor cases for missiles. After they sold the business, they started another focused on super elastic orthopedic implants. His team from that company later left together to start ColdSnap.\nForget foldable TVs. Transparent screens are the cool new tech trend\n\u201cIt\u2019s been really fun with my daughters, who have seen the whole beginning of starting a company, purchasing a 2,500 sq. ft. building, getting patents, and they have shares in the company,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been explaining how the investors invest in us and how we can\u2019t let them down.\u201d\nThe company has since grown to an 18-person team. Despite the high price tag, Fonte said the company has \u201cthousands\u201d of sign-ups from people to buy the product. \u201cSometimes we get notes on our website that just say, \u2018Hurry up. I need this.\u2019\u201d\nKeurig-inspired ice cream machines aren\u2019t entirely new. LG demoed a frozen yogurt pod system prototype called SnowWhite at the 2019 SXSW conference in Austin, and startup Wim Yogurt developed a $299 frozen yogurt machine but suspended operations in 2018. Meanwhile, traditional at-home ice cream machines can cost less than $100.\nThe cost of the ColdSnap system may conjure up memories of Juicero, the $400 web-connected Keurig-for-pressed-juice system backed by Google and others. It received $120 million in capital, but ultimately failed largely due to the price point, with many saying Silicon Valley was out of touch with the rest of the country. There were also reports customers could get the same result by squeezing the startup\u2019s juice packs with their bare hands as with the machine.\nColdSnap, however, was originally intended for commercial spaces like break rooms in offices, car dealerships and student unions. When Covid hit earlier last year, the company refocused. Fonte said he aims to take the price down to $500 by switching stainless steel parts for plastic fixtures. The pods will cost $2.99 each when it launches.\nKeurig-like spinoffs are plentiful, ranging from pod coffee and pod cocktails to pod cookies. ColdSnap claims its product is a much cleaner play, due to the recyclable aluminum pods, which resemble Red Bull cans, and the process of keeping ice cream cold inside of the trucks that then transport it.\nJudging from the enthusiastic response, it appears people still want a product like this to become a reality. Fonte said US interest is high but he also sees opportunity in places such as India and China where the cold supply chain is spotty and could benefit from an on-demand system like ColdSnap.\n\u201cWe hope that maybe someday, in 20 years, people will look back and say, \u2018Remember when ice cream was frozen the whole time. How crazy is that?\u2019\u201d\nPerhaps innovation is a dish best served cold.\nMore from CNN Business\nCNN Business Videos\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
