Hawkins, transportation editor with 10+ years of experience who covers EVs, public transportation, and aviation. His work has appeared in The New York Daily News and City & State.\nShare this story\nAfter back-to-back years of bringing unique, compelling concepts to the floor of the Consumer Electronics Show, BMW is turning inward in 2024 and focusing on the interior of the vehicle \u2014 namely, the types of technology and media content the automaker thinks its customers will want to interact with as they drive their high-priced, high-powered vehicles into the future.\nIn a statement, Frank Weber, chief technology officer and member of the board of management responsible for BMW Group development, said that the company was showing \u201cmore content, more customization, and more gaming.\u201d And coming soon, the company\u2019s operating system will feature \u201cperfectly aligned\u201d augmented reality and \u201cstrong, reliable\u201d AI to enable better communication between the car and the driver.\nPractically, this means that BMW is bringing more streaming video content and gaming options to its vehicles. For its future lineup, the automaker insists that its customers will be able to use previously unavailable technologies, including augmented and mixed reality and in-car voice assistants powered by generative AI. No barf bags required.\nBMW Operating System 9, also known as iDrive 9, relies on Google\u2019s Android Automotive software. Customers who purchase the optional \u201cBMW Digital Premium\u201d package will get access to a range of third-party apps from the company\u2019s ConnectedDrive store, including gaming on their vehicle\u2019s infotainment display while parked or charging at an EV station. Assumedly, rear passengers will be able to play as well using massive screens such as the BMW i7\u2019s 32-inch drop-down display.\nAnd now, for the first time, BMW owners will be able to use real video game controllers when playing. The automaker says \u201cany standard gaming controller with Bluetooth capability\u201d can be used as long as the customer\u2019s vehicle supports Operating System 9. Over-the-air software updates that will enable video game controllers are coming in 2024, BMW says. One such game that can be played using controllers is Beach Buggy Racing 2, a mobile game available in both the iOS App Store and the Google Play Store.\nBMW is now the latest automaker to bring gaming to its cars. The trend was kicked off by Tesla, which has gone faster and further (sometimes too far) in offering gaming options to its customers. Tesla customers can use game controllers or even the car\u2019s own native controls, like the steering wheel, to play certain games.\nUsing the company\u2019s preexisting AirConsole app, vehicle owners can choose between single-player and multiplayer games. \u201cCasual\u201d games in which customers can use their smartphones as controllers will also be available.\nOf course, in-car distractions are at an all-time high, and BMW will have to put guardrails in place to ensure that vehicle owners aren\u2019t able to misuse these features while driving or that passenger gaming isn\u2019t distracting the driver.\nIf you\u2019re not a hardcore or even casual gamer, perhaps you\u2019ll find BMW\u2019s expanded video streaming options more up your alley. The company is updating its in-car video app for vehicles running Operating System 8.5 and 9, including on-demand and live offerings. BMW is bringing these expanded options to more vehicles in 2024, such as the BMW X2 and all models in the new Mini lineup.\nBMW\u2019s i7 sedan \u2014 the one with the enormous 31-inch drop-down movie screen for rear passengers \u2014\u00a0includes embedded Amazon Fire TV. The company is now working to integrate something called \u201cDTS AutoStage Video Service powered by TiVo,\u201d which it says includes \u201cboth live channels and on-demand media libraries covering the categories news, sport, entertainment for kids, movies and TV series.\u201d That system was first launched with BMW\u2019s 5 series and will be coming to more \u201cexecutive and luxury\u201d models via an over-the-air software update in 2024.\nAutomakers have been trying to make AR applications for their cars for a very long time. But now, BMW is claiming to be among the first to get it right.\nThe company says it will demonstrate this capability \u201cfor the first time\u201d at CES in Las Vegas. (Our producer Becca Farsace has heroically volunteered to try it out at the show, so look out for that. Prayers up she doesn\u2019t get too nauseous.)\nPassengers will be invited to don a pair of Xreal Air 2 AR glasses, which use\u00a0Micro OLEDs to project a 1920 x 1080 pixel display in front of your eyes. In this way, they will \u201csee how navigation instructions, hazard warnings, entertainment content, information on charging stations and supporting visualizations in parking situations are embedded perfectly into the real-world environment.\u201d\nHow perfectly? TBD. You\u2019ll recall that BMW is also working with Meta to alleviate any issues of interacting with virtual objects while moving through the real world at high speed. Normally, AR and VR applications would have an extremely difficult time working in a moving vehicle, but BMW says it has figured it out. (I think it\u2019s worth quoting the company in full so you can properly understand the level of confidence we\u2019re talking about):\nThe BMW Group has been working on the development of AR/MR technology since 2008 and investigating possible applications for head-mounted displays in research projects. The BMW engineers, together with their development partners, have now succeeded in showing stable augmented reality and mixed reality content to passengers in a dynamically moving vehicle for the first time. The displayed image remains securely embedded in the environment even in challenging driving situations, such as when turning, driving over large bumps or accelerating. To achieve this, the tracking system of the AR/MR device in question has to be linked to the vehicle\u2019s sensor data.\nBMW says it wants to create an \u201cindustry standard\u201d for how AR and MR can be used in vehicles, pointing to its work with digital keys as an example of how it would approach such work.\nThe company assumes that rear passengers, such as luxury vehicle owners who are often chauffeured to work, will want to wear Xreal\u2019s AR glasses to do work or participate in virtual meetings. Gaming is another possible application.\nBMW says it is making progress on using Amazon\u2019s Alexa technology to build its own custom voice assistant, which it first announced back in 2022. The company says it\u2019s ready to show off its progress so far in advance of \u201ca potential series rollout.\u201d (In other words, still under development and no guaranteed product to announce yet.)\nUsing Alexa\u2019s large language model as its foundation, BMW\u2019s Intelligent Personal Assistant will be able to respond to \u201cquick instructions and answers about vehicle functions in a much more human, conversation-like manner, while at the same time being able to control some vehicle functions.\u201d\nTo be sure, Alexa has been available as an in-car voice assistant in BMW vehicles since 2018. But BMW says its current lineup lacks \u201ccomplex processing capabilities\u201d and \u201chuman-like interactions and dialogs,\u201d but that could be coming soon thanks to LLMs.\nAutomakers across the industry are scrambling to create stronger links between their voice assistants and core vehicle functions. What\u2019s interesting here is that BMW is sticking with its plan to use Amazon\u2019s Alexa as its basis rather than shifting to Google\u2019s AI products, which could theoretically complement the automaker\u2019s Android-based operating system.\nLastly, BMW says it\u2019s working with auto supplier Valeo on an \u201cautomated valet parking\u201d feature that also could work via teleoperation.\nAccording to the automaker, customers would leave their vehicles in designated drop-off areas. The vehicle would then search for a vacant parking space itself, maneuver into the space, and later drive back to the pick-up area for collection by the driver. \u201cEither an autonomous driving system or a teleoperated valet system can be used as the underlying technology for this,\u201d BMW adds.\nThe challenges of teleoperation are myriad, mainly around maintain a strong connection between the remote operator and the vehicle without any latency. Most autonomous vehicle companies include some form of teleassistance, but full-blown remote operation remains a mixed bag.\nLike most automakers, BMW has been working on self-parking technology for a bit, even getting recognition from the US Department of Transportation for it at one time. But self-parking is tricky, and while all companies have some self-parking or even automated parallel parking system available, it would be a stretch to suggest that it\u2019s entirely bug-free.\nNetflix is turning into cable TV\nNetflix is going to take away its cheapest ad-free plan\nNintendo goes after the Palworld Pok\u00e9mon modder\nThe Verge\u2019s favorite mobile phone gadgets\nThe Pixel 9 leaks are already here\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nVolkswagen says it\u2019s putting ChatGPT in its cars for \u2018enriching conversations\u2019\nAppliance makers are teaming up to reduce your electricity usage\u00a0\u2014\u00a0and save you cash\nGet ready to watch LG\u2019s livestream at 11AM ET.\nAMD\u2019s new $329 Radeon RX 7600 XT is \u2018ready to take on 1440p\u2019\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

In doing so, they see how\nnavigation and hazard information, information on points of interest\nand entertainment content are perfectly embedded in the real\nenvironment through the \u201cXREAL Air 2\u201d. AR and MR (mixed reality)\ndevices will steadily gain in popularity in the coming years due to\ntechnological advances and more accessible entry-level models. These\ndevices have the potential to provide both drivers and passengers with\nextended information and content \u2014 as a supplement to the displays\ninstalled in the vehicle.\nSince 2008, BMW has been following the development of AR/MR\ntechnology and has been investigating the possible uses of\nhead-mounted displays as part of research projects. Through the\nresulting development collaborations, BMW engineers have succeeded for\nthe first time in displaying stable augmented reality (AR) and mixed\nreality (MR) content to passengers in a moving vehicle. Even in\nchallenging driving situations, for example when the vehicle turns,\ndrives over bumps, or accelerates, the displayed image remains stable.\nTo achieve this, the tracking system of the respective AR/MR device\nmust be connected to the vehicle's sensor data.\nBMW has continuously expanded its experience with AR/MR devices over\nthe years and presented it to the public, starting with the\u00a0MINI\nAugmented Vision project (2015), the collaboration\nwith Meta Reality Labs (2022 & 2023), the ConnectedRide\nSmartglasses from BMW Motorrad, and the M Mixed Reality Driving\nExperience. In current BMW and MINI models, the \u201cAugmented View\u201d\nfunction offers the driver a live video stream on the display for the\nbest possible orientation when navigating, which is expanded with\nadditional, augmented information.\nBMW has already successfully pioneered digital technologies such as\nvehicle access based on the BMW Digital Key and has driven forward the\nstandardization of such innovations in the industry. When it comes to\nAR/MR, the company is also open to cooperation with other partners to\nachieve the goal of creating an industry standard for connecting XR\ndevices in the CE industry with vehicles.\nDevelopment demo: Voice assistant becomes the ultimate vehicle\nexpert with the help of Amazon Alexa Large Language Model (LLM).\nBMW and Amazon are showcasing voice assistant LLM capabilities based\non a current development project the companies are working on for a\npotential series rollout. This makes the BMW Intelligent Personal\nAssistant the ultimate vehicle expert enabled by generative AI,\npowered by the Alexa LLM. Visitors will experience how the voice\nassistant provides quick instructions and answers about vehicle\nfunctions in a much more human, conversational manner, while at the\nsame time being able to control some vehicle functions.\nThe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant has been using artificial\nintelligence for speech processing for a long time, and this demo is\nthe latest proof of the continued innovation BMW and its partners are\nbringing to customers. Complex processing capabilities, which enable\nhuman-like interactions and dialogs, had not yet been integrated into\nthe existing Intelligent Personal Assistant. Such capabilities are now\nmade possible by LLMs (Large Language Models), which are AI models\ndesigned to process human language at a high level and generate\nresponses accordingly. The BMW Group is also taking careful steps to\nbuild a safe and trusted experience for customers, and continues to\ntest and iterate these LLM capabilities over time with its partners.\nSince the introduction of the first BMW Intelligent Personal\nAssistant in 2018, language interaction has been an essential part of\nBMW iDrive. Today, the voice assistant gives customers control over\nmany vehicle functions so that they can keep their hands on the wheel\nand their eyes on the road. Leveraging Amazon\u2019s Alexa Custom Assistant\n\u2014 a solution based on Alexa technology that enables companies to\ncreate their own customized voice assistant \u2014 the next generation of\nthe BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant will soon become more powerful\nover the course of the year in vehicles with BMW Operating System 9.\nJoint development project with Valeo enables remote-controlled\nvalet parking.\nBMW and Valeo are working in a strategic partnership on the joint\ndevelopment of next-generation automated Level 4 parking solutions.\nThis also includes the development of solutions for automated valet\nparking (AVP). The customer leaves the vehicle at a defined drop off\npoint. From there, the vehicle automatically searches for a parking\nspace, performs the necessary maneuvers to enter the space, and can\nreturn to the pick-up point. The underlying technology can be either\nan autonomous driving system or a remote-controlled valet system.\nAt CES 2024, visitors can try out remote-controlled valet parking for\nthemselves. Remote control provides control in situations where fully\nautonomous systems may face major challenges, such as complex or\nunknown environments.\nThe remote control uses modern technology and live camera images to\nnavigate and move the vehicle in order to park and return in a\ncontrolled manner. Possible areas of application for this technology\nin the future could include parking for events, at airports, or in logistics.\n#\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 #\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 #\nBMW Group In America\nBMW of North America, LLC has been present in the United States since\n1975.\u00a0 Rolls-Royce Motor Cars NA, LLC began distributing vehicles in\n2003.\u00a0 The BMW Group in the United States has grown to include\nmarketing, sales, and financial service organizations for the BMW\nbrand of motor vehicles, including motorcycles, the MINI brand, and\nRolls-Royce Motor Cars; Designworks, a strategic design consultancy\nbased in California; a technology office in Silicon Valley and various\nother operations throughout the country.\u00a0 BMW Manufacturing Co., LLC\nin South Carolina is the BMW Group global center of competence for BMW\nX models and assembles the X3, X4, X5, X6 and X7 Sports Activity\nVehicles as well as the BMW XM.

        "raw_content": "Surprise! Qualcomm Had Two Cars On Display At CES 2024\nQualcomm is best known as the chip manufacturer that produces some of the most powerful silicon you will find in a smartphone. It also makes computing hardware such as the Snapdragon X Elite that we'll see in some PCs later this year. If you need a 5G modem, Qualcomm is a pretty good place to start. Meanwhile, Qualcomm has been making the components for its Snapdragon Digital Chassis for a few years now, and when you think about it, it makes sense.\nCars are becoming more and more like rolling smartphones. With smart technology, always-on connectivity, voice assistants, navigation, and more, cars continue their transition into a whole new computing space. Therefore, it's only natural that Qualcomm is throwing its hat in the ring with components for running those internals, as well as connectivity and a whole lot more.\nWhat is surprising is that Qualcomm flew me out to Las Vegas to see not one but two cars that are showcasing that technology. One is a concept car that shows what might be possible someday. The other is a car you can buy today, though it will cost you. So here's a quick look at both of those cars.\nBMW i7 xDrive60\nThe car you can buy today is the BMW i7 x Drvie60. BMW has been working with Qualcomm for several years now, and this car is the epitome of high-tech. Most of the controls are manipulated on touchscreens, which sometimes isn't ideal, but most car functions, including opening and closing the doors, can be controlled with your voice. With a simple \"Hey BMW,\" you can ask the car to turn up the heat, open the windows, or change the radio station.\nSlip into the back seat, and you're treated to a gigantic 31-inch screen that drops down and contains all your entertainment needs. The video can play in the center of the screen or be swiped over to either side. Further, the door's armrest has a smartphone-sized screen that allows you to change your seat's positioning, adjust the climate control, start a massage session, and change what's on the screen in front of you. It's pretty snazzy.\nMeanwhile, the car is the very definition of luxury, which is probably why the price starts at over $100,000 and goes up from there. But with Merino leather seats, a full massage setup in the back, and all that technology packed in, it earns it, even if its range tops out at an unimpressive 321 miles on a single charge.\nQualcomm automotive concept car\nMeanwhile, if you want to know what Qualcomm envisions for the future, you'll want to check out its concept car. This car, built by Qualcomm itself, features screens galore in the front seat and the back, including one that spans the entire cockpit from A-pillar to A-pillar.\nIn one of the more impressive demos, the car can self-diagnose itself, but it goes further than that. The car has a built-in LLM model, similar to ChatGPT, but trained on the car's specifications and owner's manual. The result is that when you get a notification that something is wrong (in common parlance, a \"dummy light\"), you can ask the car what is wrong. Not only will the car tell you what returned the error, but it will also tell you how to fix it, and if necessary, it will use cloud integration with Salesforce to find a dealer where you can fix the problem and even schedule an appointment for you.\nThe bottom line is Snapdragon Digital Chassis brings a lot more of your smartphone into your car, and Qualcomm, rather than just bolting on an AI model and calling it a day, has put a lot of thought into how AI can be a helpful tool in the future. Voice is a very natural way to work with LLMs, and drivers behind the wheel are in a great position to do so. It remains to be seen how this technology will show up in a production vehicle, but this promise is a good reason to be optimistic."

        "raw_content": "2024 BMW i7\nStarting at $106,695\nSelect a year\nOverview\nElectric powertrains make a lot of sense in a large luxury car. Take the 2024 BMW i7, which features a powerful EV powertrain with a nearly silent operation that only serves to enhance the feeling of serenity that luxury buyers expect. Couple that with a smooth ride and a spacious cabin built from premium materials and you have an electric 7-series that's worth its asking price. The i7 is a sedan for the tech-savvy buyer, too, as it's filled to the brim with digital displays and even can be had with a drop-down theater system for those chauffeured in the back\u2014something its chief rival, the Mercedes-Benz EQS, doesn't offer. The i7 xDrive60 comes with 536 horsepower and a driving range of up to 318 miles, while a performance-oriented M70 trim boosts power to 650 hp and offers a range of around 295 miles. A rear-wheel drive eDrive50 model is offered too, and although BMW hasn't said yet, it should offer the most driving range of the bunch. Those range numbers are good enough to compete with rivals such as the Porsche Taycan and the Tesla Model S, neither of which offer anywhere near the sort of sybaritic luxury that the i7 does.\nWhere This Vehicle Ranks\nLucid Motors Air\nPorsche Taycan\nPorsche Taycan Cross Turismo\nBMW i7\nGenesis Electrified G80\nMaserati GranTurismo Folgore\nWhat's New for 2024?\nBMW has added the 650-hp M70 and 449-hp eDrive50 models to the i7's lineup for 2024. The more powerful electric powertrain is said to power the big sedan to 60 mph in just 3.5 seconds and still offers an estimated 295-mile driving range per charge. The eDrive50 uses a single, rear-mounted motor but BMW hasn't yet disclosed its performance or range estimates. Otherwise, we're expecting that the i7 will carry over to the new year with no other major changes.\nPricing and Which One to Buy\nThe price of the 2024 BMW i7 starts at $106,695 and goes up to $169,495 depending on the trim and options.\nUnless you're expecting to be challenged at every stop light for an impromptu drag race, we'd suggest sticking with the xDrive60 model. It still offers plenty of zip from its 536-hp powertrain and comes standard with a host of desirable features. Like the gasoline-powered 7-series, the i7 is a limousine-like luxury sedan that can be configured to pamper rear-seat occupants with the optional Executive Lounge package. We'd recommend that package, as it adds plenty of features to justify its price tag, including plush reclining rear seats with massage.\nEV Motor, Power, and Performance\nAll-wheel drive i7s use a similar electric powertrain setup as the brand's EV SUV, the iX, with two electric motors\u2014one driving each axle\u2014making a combined 536 horsepower. In our testing, the i7 xDrive60 hit 60 mph in 4.1 seconds. The rear-wheel drive eDrive50 model makes 449 horsepower and performance will likely be slightly slower. The more powerful M70 model dials up the heat to 650 horsepower and we estimate that model will hit 60 mph in just 3.3 seconds. Handling is surprisingly agile for a large sedan but the regular i7 won't attract buyers looking for sports-sedan handling. Those seeking a comfortable and luxurious experience will find much to like and during our first test drive, we noted its particularly smooth ride and hushed cabin. The M70 model dials in more fun, and the large sedan feels unnaturally light on its feet, but it's not as sharp as BMW's real M-series cars. If you'd prefer a gasoline-powered 7-series, one is still available; we review that model separately.\nRange, Charging, and Battery Life\nOn its standard 19-inch wheels, the i7 xDrive60 offers an estimated driving range of 318 miles per charge, but with the larger and more attractive 20- and 21-inch wheels the sedan's driving range drops. On our highway fuel-economy test route, we managed to squeeze 260 miles out of our xDrive60 test vehicle which rolled on 21-inch wheels.\nThe EPA says the eDrive50 should be good for as many as 321 miles per charge and the M70 model should deliver up to 291 miles per charge. The car's large 101.7-kWh battery pack can be hooked up to DC fast charging stations and is said to be capable of adding 80 miles of driving range in just 10 minutes on such a connection. Speaking of charging, BMW is including three years of free 30-minute charging sessions at Electrify America charging stations with every new i7.\nFuel Economy and Real-World MPGe\nThe EPA estimates that the i7 xDrive60 should deliver up to 87 MPGe city and 92 MPGe highway. The M70 should offer slightly lower numbers while the eDrive50 should go a little higher. For more information about the i7's fuel economy, visit the EPA's website.\nInterior, Comfort, and Cargo\nBecause they were developed jointly, the i7 benefits from the same spacious, luxurious, and upscale cabin ambiance as the gasoline-powered 7-series. In addition to luxuries, the i7 offers a bevy of high-tech convenience features that put it on solid footing versus rivals such as the Mercedes-Benz EQS and the Tesla Model S. There's generous room in both the front and the rear seats and fine materials lining every square inch of the interior. Opt for the Executive Lounge package and your rear-seat passengers will be treated to power-adjustable reclining seats, a wireless smartphone charging pad, and extra-plush headrests. The trunk space is plentiful but if you're hauling longer items, you'll find a handy rear-seat pass-through feature.\nInfotainment and Connectivity\nThe i7 borrows its digital dashboard from the iX SUV, which consists of large floating digital- gauge and infotainment displays. Sandwiched together under a single pane of glass, the two displays offer a clear look at driving data and entertainment features. There is also an available rear-seat entertainment system featuring a large 31.3-inch screen that drops from the ceiling and can access streaming services such as Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube via the car's 5G cellular connection.\nSafety and Driver-Assistance Features\nA host of driver-assistance features are standard with more advanced tech available optionally. Available features include a hands-free driving mode for use on the highway and a parking assistant system that allows the driver to exit the vehicle and park the car via a smartphone app. For more information about the i7's crash-test results, visit the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) websites. Key safety features are expected to include:\nWarranty and Maintenance Coverage\nThe i7 comes standard with the same warranty coverage as BMW's other electrified models, the iX SUV and the i4 sedan, which means basic coverage for four years or 50,000 miles and more generous protection for the electric-vehicle components. All new BMWs also come with a three-year complimentary maintenance plan.\nSpecifications\n2023 BMW i7 xDrive60Vehicle Type: front- and rear-motor, all-wheel-drive, 5-passenger, 4-door
