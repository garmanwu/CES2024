        "raw_content": "New 3D printing technology from Creality, Formlabs, Doser, and Siemens launched at CES 2024\nCES 2024 is underway. Running until January 14, the consumer technology trade show includes leading companies spanning the entire tech sector, with global names such as Amazon, Google and Samsung in attendance. The expo has drawn criticism from within the tech industry, and is sometimes characterized as gimmicky. CES 2024 has certainly seen a focus on trendy and buzzword-heavy technology over practical innovations that meet industry needs.\nFor instance, Xpeng Motors has showcased its Xpeng AeroHY eVTOL Flying Flying Car, which is yet to extend beyond the concept stage. Elsewhere, Swarovski launched a pair of AI-powered bird watching binoculars priced at an eye-watering $4,799. The fact that CES 2024 is held in Las Vegas does little to foster an image of a serious industry and application focused technology expo.\nFrom the 3D printing world Creality, Formlabs, Siemens, Goofoo, and Doser, are showcasing new 3D printers and manufacturing solutions at CES 2024. However, the 3D printing presence this year is below that of previous years. In the past companies including Lynxter, Revopoint, Handddle, and Anycubic have exhibited at the multi-venue show.\nThe decrease in 3D printing exhibitors does not seem to reflect trends in the industry. According to a recent report from market intelligence firm CONTEXT, Q2 2023 saw a 12% unit shipment increase and 22% YoY system revenue growth in Personal and Kit & Hobby 3D printers. This growth has been driven by the emergence of Desktop 3D printer manufacturers AnkerMake and Bambu Lab, with the latter taking \u201cthe personal 3D printer market by storm,\u201d according to CONTEXT.\nTherefore, the limited 3D printing presence is a reflection on CES itself, suggesting that exposure on the show floor does not justify the exhibiting fees, which can reach $60,000 for a 30\u2019 x 30\u2019 booth.\nFormlabs bolsters resin 3D printing portfolio\nOn day one of CES 2024, resin-based 3D printer manufacturer Formlabs announced the launch of a new resin pumping system, as well as two new materials, Polypropylene Powder and Premium Teeth Resin. These new offerings have been released to bolster the efficiency, versatility, and scalability of the company\u2019s 3D printing ecosystem which is centered around prototyping and in-house production.\n\u201c3D printing production is steadily increasing, and the introduction of Resin Pumping System, Polypropylene Powder, and Premium Teeth Resin are three big steps in our mission to provide professionals with a full ecosystem of the tools they need to bring their ideas to life,\u201d commented Formlabs\u2019 Chief Product Officer D\u00e1vid Lakatos.\nAccording to Formlabs, its new Resin Pumping System can increase production with lower associated resin costs and reduced waste, allowing users in more industries to integrate 3D printing into their workflows.\nThis new offering is compatible with Formlabs\u2019 Form 3 and Form 3L 3D printers. Dubbed as a \u2018plug-and-play\u2019 replacement for standard one liter cartridges, the Resin Pumping System delivers five liters of resin directly to the 3D printer\u2019s resin tank. This new product is available to purchase for $199.\nFormlabs\u2019 new Polypropylene Powder adds to the company\u2019s SLS 3D printing portfolio, and is designed to be used with its Fuse 1+ 30W 3D printers. This new material aims to enable efficient and low-cost production of products commonly made from polypropylene, the second-most widely produced commodity plastic in the world. These products include home appliances, electronics, sports equipment, custom lab equipment, prototypes, and manufacturing tools.\nThe Premium Teeth Resin from Formlabs is aimed at the dental 3D printing industry. Formlabs already possesses an ecosystem of over 15 million 3D printed dental parts within this market. This new resin is reportedly a nano-ceramic filled FDA-registered Class II biocompatible material which can be customized to mimic a patient\u2019s natural teeth translucency and opalescence.\nThe DoserRx1: addressing the need for customized medication\nCES 2024 saw Doser enter the 3D printed personalized medication field with the launch of the DoserRx1, a desktop 3D printer for the production of personalized pharmaceutical pils.\nLeveraging semi solid extrusion (SSE) technology, the DoserRx1 is designed to meet high demand for custom dosing. The DoserRx1 can reportedly operate at low temperatures, and 3D print up to 100 tablets per hour. What\u2019s more, Doser claims that its new 3D printer can produce around 80% of all medication available today.\nThe DoserRx1 has also been designed for ease of use, using refillable cartridges that come pre-loaded with the necessary ingredients and formulations for tablet production. The 3D printer is GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) compliant, and possesses GAMP-5 (Good Automated Manufacturing Practice) aligned capabilities.\nBesides the 3D printing of prescribed medication, the DoserRx1 has also been designed for the fabrication of personalized nutrient and vitamin supplements. Changing the color, taste and the dosage of pils are highlighted as some of the customization options available with the DoserRx1.\n\u201cImagine a world where every pill or supplement is tailored just for you, ensuring you have the optimal dose during your treatment. That\u2019s the future Doser is creating with DoseRx1,\u201d stated Arjan van unen, Doser CEO.\nTwo new desktop 3D printers from Creality\nCES 2024 saw a notable announcement within the desktop 3D printing world, with the launch of two new FDM 3D printers from Shenzhen-based 3D printing manufacturer Creality. During the show, Creality unveiled the K1C, a successor to the Creality and its new flagship 3D printer. Additionally, the company introduced the Ender-3 V3, a seemingly similar offering to the Ender-3 V3 KE.\nThe Creality K1C, much like the K1, is an enclosed CoreXY 3D printer with maximum 3D printing speeds of 600 mm/s. Notably, the \u201cC\u201d in the name of Creality\u2019s new 3D printer stands for carbon, with the K1C capable of 3D printing with carbon fiber filament along with standard PLA.\nWhilst the complete technical specification of the K1C are yet to be disclosed, this new 3D printer features an all metal hotend capable of reaching and maintaining 300\u2103, and sports a new build plate and improved motor system.\nDetails are also limited for the Ender-3 V3. However this new addition to Ender series has been confirmed to offer 600 mm/s 3D print speeds, as well as a 220 x 220 x 250 mm build volume.\nSiemens\u2019 launches new AI and VR offerings\nDuring CES 2024, Industrial manufacturing firm Siemens has made a number of announcements relating to artificial intelligence (AI) and immersive engineering to enable the growth of an \u2018industrial metaverse.\u2019\nOne such announcement was between Siemens and Japanese tech giant Sony. This new partnership will see the two companies introduce a new platform that combines Siemens\u2019 Xcelerator software portfolio with Sony\u2019s new spatial content creation system, which features the company\u2019s XR virtual reality headset.\nThrough the headsets 4K OLED Microdisplays and controllers, this new platform will allow designers and engineers to interact with 3D objects and create new design concepts in virtual reality. It is hoped that this new offering will kickstart content creation for what the companies are calling the \u2018industrial metaverse.\u2019 Called Siemens\u2019 NX Immersive designer, this offering will be released commercially later in the year.\nAt CES 2024, Siemens has also announced that it is strengthening its partnership with Amazon Web Services. Through this collaboration, the companies aim to increase the ease at which business can build and scale generative AI applications.\nThrough this partnership, Siemens is integrating Amazon Bedrock with Mendix, a low-code platform part of the Xcelerator portfolio. Amazon\u2019s bedrock service offers a choice of high-performance foundation models from various AI companies via a single API, as well as security, privacy, and responsible AI capabilities.\nFinally, Siemens announced an additional update to its Siemens Xcelerator software portfolio, launching the Siemens Xcelerator Developer Portal. This new addition to Xcelerator is advertised as a \u2018first-of-its-kind\u2019 platform that consolidates all of Siemens\u2019 APIs and developer resources.\nThe portal is designed to provide a unified platform for developers to access and explore Siemens and partner APIs. Siemens has also collaborated with Microsoft to add an AI\u00a0chatbot to the portal, which it hopes will enhance the development experience.\nSubscribe to the 3D Printing Industry newsletter to keep up to date with the latest 3D printing news.

This morning at CES, the company announced its new Resin Pumping System\u2014an accessory for its Form 3 and Form 3L printers\u2014as well as two new materials, Polypropylene Powder and Premium Teeth Resin. These new solutions will help Formlabs lower costs and increase production for its ecosystem, which is used by customers for prototyping and in-house 3D printing.\n\u201c3D printing production is steadily increasing, and the introduction of Resin Pumping System, Polypropylene Powder, and Premium Teeth Resin are three big steps in our mission to provide professionals with a full ecosystem of the tools they need to bring their ideas to life,\u201d Formlabs Chief Product Officer D\u00e1vid Lakatos said in a press release.\nResin Pumping System\nFormlabs, which many in the industry still think could go public in the near future, has sold over 130,000 printers around the world, and its ecosystem includes both selective laser sintering (SLS) and stereolithography (SLA) 3D printers, as well as over 45 materials to produce end-use parts, rapid tooling, and more. The new Resin Pumping System is a plug-and-play replacement for the standard one-liter cartridge\u2014delivering five liters of resin to a printer\u2019s tank, the accessory enables increased and continuous 3D printing, while also reducing waste and cost-per-part.\nThe company says its new system is easy to use, and not only lowers resin costs, but also reduces packaging waste by 86%. It\u2019s used with with the\u00a0 Form 3 and large-format Form 3L SLA printers, and is said to enable non-stop printing for five times longer. The Resin Pumping System operates with five liter containers of select materials, at an initial discount of at least 10% when compared to typical one liter cartridges.\nOne happy customer is leading U.S. drone manufacturer Skydio, which was founded in 2014 by two MIT graduates after they helped start Google\u2019s Project Wing. In 2018, the company launched R1, which it calls a \u201cbreakthrough in autonomous drones for consumers.\u201d\n\u201cSkydio is constantly 3D printing to iterate using Form 3+ printers, which provides a huge advantage in hardware development. Resin Pumping System benefitted me and my team because I don\u2019t have to check on the one liter cartridge, which ran out once and caused us to place a frantic, last-minute order,\u201d said Skydio Senior Hardware Development Specialist Eric Weinhoffer. \u201cNow, Resin Pumping System and the five liter container reduce the mental burden on me and ensure our printers keep running.\u201d\nThe new Formlabs Resin Pumping System costs $199 and is available for order immediately.\nPolypropylene Powder\nThe lightweight, low-density, and chemically resistant properties of polypropylene (PP)\u2014the world\u2019s second-most widely produced commodity plastic\u2014makes it attractive for applications in automotive parts, packaging, consumer products, and more.\nThe new high-performance manufacturing Polypropylene Powder by Formlabs, currently available for purchase, will grow the company\u2019s SLS portfolio, so that users can more efficiently and inexpensively print PP products, like custom lab and sports equipment, home appliances, and electronics, in-house on the Fuse 1+ 30W.\nPremium Teeth Resin\nThe last new product Formlabs will debut at CES today is Premium Teeth Resin, a nano-ceramic filled FDA registered Class II biocompatible material. This resin balances natural-looking aesthetics and validated longevity with excellent clinical performance and intraoral mechanical properties, in addition to simpler digital workflows, to create 3D printed denture teeth and temporary full-arch implant-supported restorations (All-on-X). Users can count on Premium Teeth Resin, currently available to order, to help accurately customize prints to specific patient anatomy, and ensure personal, affordable dental care.\n\u201cI have been thoroughly impressed with Formlabs Premium Teeth Resin,\u201d said Dr. Christopher Baer, dentist, Baer Dental. \u201cThe material not only has the strength we need for denture teeth and All-on-X appliances, but it also polishes with minimal effort to reveal a natural, lifelike translucency.\u201d\nThe Dental 3D Printing Market\nMore accessible 3D printing workflows, and specialty materials like the new Premium Teeth Resin, are helping to lower the cost and labor barriers to digital dentistry. According to \u201c3D Printing in Dentistry 2023\u201d by AM Research, the dental 3D printing market generated $4 billion in revenue in 2022\u2014nearly an entire third of the overall additive manufacturing market. For several years, Formlabs has been a leader in the dental 3D printing industry, with its technology ecosystem supporting over 15 million 3D printed dental parts. Especially with the recent shutdown of Smile Direct Club, the 3D printing double unicorn remains in a good position to grab an even bigger piece of the digital dentistry pie.\nWith the debut of its new Resin Pumping System, Polypropylene Powder, and Premium Teeth Resin, Formlabs plans to improve the efficiency, scalability, and versatility of its 3D printing ecosystem, and further enable in-house 3D printing for customers in a variety of industries. You can see the company\u2019s ecosystem, and its three newest solutions, for yourself at Booth #54221 at CES in Las Vegas this week.\nSubscribe to Our Email Newsletter\nStay up-to-date on all the latest news from the 3D printing industry and receive information and offers from third party vendors.\nShare this Article\nRecent News\n3D Printed Shrimp Could Keep Stakeholders at Steakholder Foods\nWhat about the Messy Humans that Make up Industry 4.0?\nShare this Article\nCategories\n3D Design\n3D Printed Art\n3D Printed Food\n3D Printed Guns\nYou May Also Like\nSchneider Electric and ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India Strike Deal to \u201cRevolutionize Smart Manufacturing\u201d\nIn June, Schneider Electric, one of the world\u2019s largest manufacturers of digital solutions for energy management, announced a partnership with ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India (AM/NS India) to establish a smart...\nThe Conspicuous Absence of 3D Printing from Biden\u2019s Latest Strategy Update on Critical Emerging Technologies\nLast week, the Biden administration released yet another policy document related to its overall economic strategy, entitled \u201cUnited States Government National Standards Strategy for Critical Emerging Technology [CET]\u201d.

        "raw_content": "Formlabs launches Automation Ecosystem made up of three new products at CES 2023\n3D printer OEM Formlabs has unveiled a high-productivity additive manufacturing platform at the CES 2023 technology convention.\nComposed of three new products, including Formlabs\u2019 Form Auto and High Volume Resin hardware packages, as well as a Fleet Control software, its \u2018Automation Ecosystem\u2019 is said to help users drive greater 3D printing utilization. In doing so, the firm anticipates that its offering will help dental labs, service bureaus and job shops to ramp up production, without significantly raising their labor requirements.\n\u201cThe Formlabs Automation Ecosystem is a seamless solution for ramping up production with 3D printer fleets, staying true to the ease of use of all Formlabs products,\u201d explained Formlabs CPO, D\u00e1vid Lakatos. \u201cFormlabs users recently achieved a major milestone, with more than 100 million parts printed on our 3D printers, and by adding this ecosystem, Formlabs is increasing the capacity so users can deliver further 3D printing innovation.\u201d\nThe evolution of Formlabs\u2019 offering\nFormlabs started out with a focus on stereolithography (SLA) 3D printing, but it has gradually expanded its portfolio, in a way that has allowed it to address new markets and customer needs. More recent additions to the firm\u2019s SLA offering include the high-speed Form 3+ and Form 3B+ 3D printers, which launched at last year\u2019s CES convention.\nBuilt to succeed Formlabs\u2019 Form 3 and Form 3B systems, these incorporate more flexible build plates that constitute a significant upgrade on their predecessors. Thanks to their integrated \u2018Build Platform 2\u2019 hardware, complete with \u2018Quick Release Technology,\u2019 these machines were said at launch to make the tool-free removal of SLA-printed parts easier than ever before. However, while both sport a 250mW laser and 85-micron laser spot size, they\u2019re marketed towards different audiences.\nPriced at $3,750, the Form 3+ is a general-purpose system built for functional prototyping and the short-run production of end-use parts. The Form 3B+, meanwhile, is a tad pricier at $4,299 but is more geared towards the precision 3D printing of medical devices, surgical tools, and other patient-specific parts, with a high level of surface finish.\nOutside of SLA 3D printing, Formlabs has also extended its offering into Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) with the launch of the Fuse 1 and Fuse 1+ 30W. Even though the former scored highly on accessibility and repeatability in a 3D Printing Industry review last February, the company later launched a beefed-up 30-watt laser version in July 2022, with broader high-performance material compatibility.\nFormlabs\u2019 big reveal at CES 2023\nDesigned to help users drive down their idle printer time as a means of improving their cost-per-part, Formlabs\u2019 new Automation Ecosystem is made up of three core elements. The first of these is the High Volume Resin System, a 5-liter resin bag and pump package, designed to expand the capacity of Formlabs\u2019 standard SLA printers and reduce their waste, while minimizing any cartridge handling tasks.\nLike the High Volume Resin System, the second part of Formlabs\u2019 Automation Ecosystem, Form Auto, can be used with any Form 3+ or Form 3B+ machine. This hardware extension is effectively designed to automatically remove finished parts from the build chamber and initiate new prints, in a way that eliminates time-consuming human interactions.\nMeanwhile, Fleet Control, the software element of this platform, packs various features from the PreForm and Dashboard print preparation and consumable management tools. In practise, the new program allows Form 3 generation printer users to create a continuously moving job queue that can be managed remotely, anywhere in the world.\nWhile each part of the Automation Ecosystem can be bought separately, Formlabs says that together, they help ease the transition from low to high-volume 3D printing. In addition to productivity gains, the company claims its latest offering could provide users with savings of up to 80% on labor, 40% on cost-per-part, and 96% on packaging waste.\nAlready, the firm has tested its automated workflow in-house, at its Manufacturing Service Bureau, which runs over 180 SLA and SLS 3D printers around the clock. Since they started running betas of Form Auto and Fleet Control in July 2020, the facility\u2019s operators are said to have had more free time to spend on value-adding tasks, in particular, due to the way the add-ons have helped automate post-processing.\nThose lucky enough to be at CES 2023 in person can check out Formlabs\u2019 new Automation Ecosystem at booth 54217.\nDespite CES primarily being a consumer-focused technology expo, it\u2019s sometimes targeted by 3D printing firms seeking to reach the widest possible audience with their latest product launches. Anycubic\u2019s new Mega SE and Wash & Cure Plus systems launched at CES 2021, complete with a simplified assembly and upgraded post-curing capabilities, allowing them to better address entry-level users.\nThat year, Aectual also launched its beta architectural 3D printing service. Fulfilled using its \u2018XL\u2019 construction system, the firm\u2019s offering allows customers to design custom household items ranging from furniture to outdoor canopies. At the time, Aectual claimed its \u2018design-to-delivery\u2019 process reduced the cost of custom-made architecture by up to 50%.\nTo stay up to date with the latest 3D printing news, don\u2019t forget to subscribe to the 3D Printing Industry newsletter or follow us on Twitter or liking our page on Facebook.\nWhile you\u2019re here, why not subscribe to our Youtube channel? featuring discussion, debriefs, video shorts and webinar replays.\nAre you looking for a job in the additive manufacturing industry?

Using the firm\u2019s new \u2018Skin360 SkinStacks\u2019 service, customers are now able to complete a facial self-scan to identify areas of improvement for their skincare routine, before ordering gummies designed to meet their specific needs.\nEach of these orders is then fulfilled by Nourished, a specialist in 3D printing supplements made up of individual nutrient layers. Previously traded under the brands Magic Candy Factory and Vitamyne, the company has a background in producing sugary treats and helping develop FabRX-3D printed personalized medicines. In the past, the firm has also worked with big consumer brands like Colgate to market its gummies, and it has now struck a deal with a similar mass-market appeal in the form of a partnership with Neutrogena.\n\u201cWe are grounded in the belief that beauty begins with healthy skin and are proud of a heritage that consistently delivers skincare solutions built at the intersection of science and technology,\u201d said Roberto Khoury, SVP of Neutrogena. \u201cWorking with Nourished allows us to further that commitment by marrying our award-winning digital skin assessment with Nourished 3D printing to create on-demand dietary supplements [which] help consumers meet their personal skincare goals.\u201d\nLaunches at KOKINI, Handddle and Lynxter\nAt CES 2023, Chinese 3D printer manufacturer KOKONI took the opportunity to launch its AI-led SOTA system. Interestingly, the machine features an \u2018upside-down\u2019 design that\u2019s said to deliver a print speed of up to 600mm/s while offering users \u201cexceptional stability with close-to-zero vibration.\u201d The system is also quiet, emitting 30 decibels of noise during operation, and packs a custom high-speed stepper motor and close-loop motor system, that provide smooth, reliable performance.\nOne of the more innovative aspects of the KOKONI SOTA is the machine\u2019s AI-powered real-time monitoring and error detection systems. According to the company, the unit\u2019s \u2018AI-intelligent camera\u2019 allows it to cover everything from spaghetti and breakage detection to material usage levels, and alert users when any changes need making.\n\u201cThe KOKONI SOTA is revolutionizing the 3D printing industry, with its advanced AI technology that allows for real-time monitoring and error detection,\u201d the firm said in a statement. \u201cIts AI-intelligent camera and micron-level optical radar monitor the printing process for errors in real-time and can alert users. KOKONI SOTA brings the power of AI to the printing process, and takes creations to new heights.\u201d\nOther esteemed 3D printer manufacturers exhibiting at the show included Handddle, which introduced an Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) platform designed to help scale 3D printing to industrial levels, as well as Lynxter. The latter showcased the Lynxter S300X it launched last year, a system capable of 3D printing silicones and polyurethanes into dampers, seals, orthoses, and functionalized textiles.\nPeugeot presents new EV concept\nAway from 3D printing system launches, French automotive multinational Peugeot debuted its additive manufacturing-enabled \u2018Inception\u2019 concept. At the center of this design concept is a next-gen \u2018i-Cockpit,\u2019 complete with a 3D printed rim-equipped \u2018Hypersquare\u2019 electronic control system, which can be retracted to make room for a panoramic passenger screen.\nIn practice, the vehicle is designed to be powered by two 800V electric motors that charge a 100kWh battery, giving it an 800-kilometer range. Though the Innovation concept itself isn\u2019t expected to enter end-production, many of its features are set to inform the designs of Peugeot\u2019s electric cars from 2025 onwards.\n\u201cPeugeot is committed to the electrification of its range,\u201d explained Peugeot Brand CEO Linda Jackson. \u201cIn 2023, 100% of the vehicles in the range will be electrified and in the next two years, five new 100% electric models will be launched. Our ambition is simple: to make Peugeot the leading electric brand in Europe by 2030. This objective and ambitious vision pave the way for a radical transformation for the brand.\u201d\nEmbracing AM in gaming and robotics\nIn gaming developments, HP division HyperX introduced its very own custom 3D printed keycap range. As part of its CES exhibition, the firm showcased a variety of personalized \u2018HX3D\u2019 keyboards, headsets, mice, and other gaming peripherals. Manufactured from an eco-friendly nylon, the first keycap unveiled at the show was a unique HyperX Cozy Cat design, voted for by the gaming community.\nOver the months ahead, this peripheral upgrade is set to be followed by several others for both HyperX and most other mechanical keyboards, which allow gamers to customize their favorite gear using HP\u2019s proprietary 3D printing technology.\n\u201cWe know gamers love customization, spending a lot of time and effort to update all kinds of in-game items, from characters to skins to weapons and beyond,\u201d said Daniel Kelley, Global Gead of Marketing at HyperX. \u201cHX3D is taking this love of personalizing a gaming experience to the physical world and enabling a wide range of fun ways to update and customize our award-winning HyperX gear.\u201d\nSouth Korean start-up Supernova, meanwhile, chose to showcase the capabilities of its HUENIT robotic arm at CES 2023. Thanks to its built-in camera, RISK-V-based processors and AI accelerators, the device is capable of identifying people and objects in real-time. This, in tandem with the arm\u2019s Bluetooth functionality, potentially allows users to deploy it wirelessly within IoT applications.\nAccording to the company, the modular system is capable of rotating 220 degrees and lifting up to 26.5 ounces of weight, and can either be fitted with tools, including a high-power laser engraver and 3D printer, or utensils for carrying out household chores.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

Castable Wax 40 Resin is the 30th proprietary resin to be added to Formlabs material library, and the 12th in the last year. The introduction of Castable Wax 40 Resin at CES further demonstrates that the next era of 3D printing won't be driven by hardware, but by materials. End-use products are only as good as the materials that make them, and the groundbreaking materials that Formlabs develops represent 3D printing\u2019s role as a driving force of innovative, customized consumer products across industries.\nFormlabs is now not only a leader in 3D printing hardware but also in resin development. Since becoming one of the first 3D printing companies to vertically integrate their material development, Formlabs has introduced more than a dozen new resins and its material science department has played a crucial role in spurring innovation throughout 2020, including providing the FDA approved, biocompatible materials needed to 3D print COVID-19 test swabs during the shortage in early 2020. Biocompatibility is a major mover in 3D printing, and Formlabs is leading that drive. In the past year, Formlabs has introduced 6 new biocompatible resins expanding their use in dental application by nearly double.\nWith the launch of Castable Wax 40 Resin, Formlabs continues to focus on bringing reliable, accessible, production-oriented jewelry products to market. It\u2019s easy for jewelers to go digital with Castable Wax 40 Resin. With unmatched casting reliability, Castable Wax 40 Resin produces results similar to blue carving wax, the traditional material used in lost wax casting. They achieved this by developing a 40 percent wax-filled material that is capable of supporting traditional casting conditions. Castable Wax 40 Resin provides jewelers with greater versatility and design freedom than traditional processes all while digitizing their workflow to enable greater efficiency. Castable Wax 40 Resin provides extraordinary end results in a hybrid workflow such as lost wax casting.\n\u201cThe advancements happening in material science are providing the 3D printing industry with a new level of utility and versatility,\u201d said D\u00e1vid Lakatos, Chief Product Officer at Formlabs. \u201cWhen revolutionary materials are combined with the unique structures 3D printers can create, the end products better meet the needs and expectations of consumers. With our rapidly growing array of materials, we are able to continually expand the list of industries that can benefit from 3D printing.\u201d\nThe latest material in Formlabs\u2019 library, Castable Wax 40 Resin, demonstrates the company\u2019s commitment to incorporating user feedback into the material development process. Formlabs worked with GIA, the world\u2019s foremost authority on diamonds, colored stones, and pearls, and Rio Grande, one of the largest jewelry findings, tools, and equipment suppliers in the world, to develop the qualities of Castable Wax 40 Resin that make it ideally suited for end-use jewelry.\nKathy Bui, Formlabs Engineering Vertical Lead, added: \u201cResins can be soft and stretchy, tough and sturdy, strong and rigid and they can also be biocompatible and FDA approved to be in contact with the skin or mucous membranes. At Formlabs, we\u2019re always working on pushing the boundaries of what\u2019s possible in additive manufacturing and materials are central to that. New materials unlock new applications, from everyday products like a pair of shoes used in a marathon to medical devices and surgical guides that assist in the operating room.\u201d\nFor more information on Formlabs\u2019 material science development and Castable Wax 40 Resin, click here.
