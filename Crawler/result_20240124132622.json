These awards, made throughout 2023, will support at least $329 million in technology-enabled capital investments to accelerate production capabilities and efficiencies.\nThis year\u2019s Manufacturing Readiness Grants will support 161 projects in 50 counties across the state designed to accelerate the adoption and implementation of smart technologies and processes in manufacturing. A significant portion of these investments are being made in small businesses (72% of projects are supporting businesses with fewer than 100 employees), rural operations (28% of projects are located in rural communities), and long-standing operations (79% are businesses more than 10 years old).\u00a0For a complete list of 2023 Manufacturing Readiness Grant recipients,\nclick here.\n\"The Manufacturing Readiness Grant program is a strategic investment in Indiana\u2019s largest, longest-held industry \u2013 a future-focused sector that will be critical to the state\u2019s growth and success as we build a global economy of the future,\u201d said Indiana Secretary of Commerce David Rosenberg. \u201cThese grants will spur technology-enabled capital investments at manufacturers statewide, helping some of Indiana\u2019s most in-need businesses make critical investments in their futures and in their workforces.\u201d\nLaunched in 2020, the Manufacturing Readiness Grants program plays a pivotal role in encouraging manufacturers to adopt emerging technologies, such as automation, robotics, 3D printing and data analytics, helping future-proof Indiana\u2019s most robust industry sector and ensuring its long-term competitiveness. Impact studies of the program from Conexus Indiana, IEDC and the Purdue University Dauch Center for the Management of Manufacturing Enterprises found that companies that adopted smart manufacturing technology added an average of five new jobs, anticipated an average payroll growth of $196,000, and increased revenue by an average of $2.5 million.\nSince its inception, a total of 526 awards totaling $56.9 million have been awarded to 465 unique companies in 79 counties, accelerating proposed projects with combined budgets of $812.7 million.\nWhile all of the available 2023 funding for the Manufacturing Readiness Grant program has been allocated, new funding will be available beginning in July 2024. Companies interested in leveraging the program to invest in technology-related advancements are encouraged to fill out an interest form online to be notified when applications re-open.\nAbout IEDC\nThe Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC) is charged with growing the State economy, driving economic development, helping businesses launch, grow and locate in the state.

From there, she said, the IEDC vetted the list to make sure the startups met CES\u2019 eligibility criteria for Eureka Park: They had to be working in the area of consumer technology, and their product or service must have been on the market no earlier than Jan. 1, 2023.\nThe startups also had to be able to travel to Las Vegas and participate in the show.\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s a very narrow list of people who fit that criteria,\u201d Jensen-Matta said of the selection requirements.\nThe IEDC is paying for the exhibit space, Jensen-Matta said, but each of the startups is responsible for paying its own way to and from CES.\nThe seven companies, and the IEDC, will be exhibiting in Eureka Park a startup-focused exhibit hall which is adjacent to the Venetian Hotel. Two IEDC-affiliated groups, Elevate Ventures and Sports Tech HQ, will also participate in the Eureka Park exhibit, Jensen-Matta said. Elevate Ventures does venture investing on behalf of the IEDC, and Sports Tech HQ was launched by the IEDC in 2022 to target the sports tech industry.\nThe Eureka Park space will be separate from the IEDC\u2019s exhibit at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center, where the IEDC will share space with several other partners: the Indy Autonomous Challenge, the Applied Research Institute, the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen, and the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research.\nIncluding booth rentals and other associated costs, the IEDC said it is spending a total of $150,000 on its exhibit spaces at CES.\nPlease enable JavaScript to view this content.\nEditor's note: You can comment on IBJ stories by signing in to your IBJ account.

From there, she said, the IEDC vetted the list to make sure the startups met CES\u2019 eligibility criteria for Eureka Park: They had to be working in the area of consumer technology, and their product or service must have been on the market no earlier than Jan. 1, 2023.\nThe startups also had to be able to travel to Las Vegas and participate in the show.\n\u201cReally, it\u2019s a very narrow list of people who fit that criteria,\u201d Jensen-Matta said of the selection requirements.\nThe IEDC is paying for the exhibit space, Jensen-Matta said, but each of the startups is responsible for paying its own way to and from CES.\nThe seven companies, and the IEDC, will be exhibiting in Eureka Park a startup-focused exhibit hall which is adjacent to the Venetian Hotel. Two IEDC-affiliated groups,\u00a0Elevate Ventures\u00a0and Sports Tech HQ, will also participate in the Eureka Park exhibit, Jensen-Matta said.\u00a0Elevate Ventures\u00a0does venture investing on behalf of the IEDC, and Sports Tech HQ was launched by the IEDC in 2022 to target the sports tech industry.\nThe Eureka Park space will be separate from the IEDC\u2019s exhibit at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center, where the IEDC will share space with several other partners: the Indy Autonomous Challenge, the Applied Research Institute, the Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen, and the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research.\nIncluding booth rentals and other associated costs, the IEDC said it is spending a total of $150,000 on its exhibit spaces at CES.\nMost Popular Stories\nEvansville area businesses among best places to work in manufacturing\nIt\u2019s time to let voters weigh in on reproductive freedom in Indiana\nIndiana coalition to invest in apprenticeship system\nCalifornia company sets up med-tech office in Warsaw\nQ&A with Rep.

(Credit: Gov. Eric Holcomb/Flickr)\nEditor\u2019s note: This article is part one in a State Affairs and Fox59/CBS4 series looking at how decisions get made at the Indiana Economic Development Corp. and how it impacts economic development in the state. The IEDC has faced increased scrutiny due to its involvement with Boone County\u2019s LEAP Lebanon Innovation District and because two gubernatorial candidates are former IEDC leaders.\nState leaders celebrated when they announced Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s expanded plans for research and manufacturing facilities in Boone County\u2019s LEAP Lebanon Innovation District, expected to generate 700 jobs and $3.7 billion worth of capital investment.\nBut the unprecedented investment also came with an unprecedented price tag for the state.\nThe Indiana Economic Development Corp., the state agency tasked with luring businesses to Indiana, agreed to supply Eli Lilly with up to an estimated $378 million-worth of tax credits, rebates and site readiness assistance for the LEAP District project. To put that into context: That\u2019s more than what the state will spend on new public and mental health initiatives for all Hoosiers over the next two years.\nSo who approves these massive deals? In this case, it was a committee of the IEDC\u2019s appointed governing board that gave the final OK on the state\u2019s largest incentive package to date. The IEDC\u2019s 14-member governing board has deep ties to the business community, and one of its members was chairman of\u00a0Eli Lilly\u2019s board of directors as recently as 2017. (The IEDC says he did not have a financial conflict of interest, nor was he on the committee that voted.)\nThe Indiana Economic Development Corp. has doled out tens of millions of dollars worth of tax incentives and grants to companies linked to its governing board members, a State Affairs and Fox59 analysis found. While individual board members appear to have recused themselves from voting on those contracts, their peers on the board do.\nThat\u2019s the challenge of a state economic development agency: Those with the most expertise to lead such an agency are typically people still in the business world.\nThe reliance on business industry leaders to decide which companies should receive state dollars and tax breaks is problematic, said Julia Vaughn, executive director of the government accountability group Common Cause Indiana.\n\u201cI think the structure creates a real problem in terms of ethics and board member involvement in key decision making,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cYou\u2019re creating conflicts of interest if you have board members who are going to be eligible for state dollars.\u201d\nNew Secretary of Commerce David Rosenberg declined an interview request through a spokesperson, but the IEDC \u2014\u00a0 which Rosenberg heads \u2014\u00a0 answered multiple questions about how its leaders avoid conflicts of interests among board members.\n\u201cBecause the IEDC is tasked with growing the state\u2019s economy, the governor appoints board members who have significant private sector experience and are experts in their respective industries,\u201d Erin Sweitzer, an IEDC spokeswoman, said in an emailed statement. \u201cThere is nothing that prohibits the companies with which our board members are associated from applying for and receiving performance-based incentives from the state, following the state process as any other business, provided that they have no role in the IEDC\u2019s decision-making process regarding that contract.\u201d\nImpact on taxpayers\nMoney for some incentives come from the state\u2019s general fund, the same taxpayer-funded bucket of cash that pays for schools, public safety or other services for Hoosiers. The rest of the incentives come in the form of tax breaks given to companies, meaning those companies relinquish a smaller portion of their earnings to the state.\nThat\u2019s why Sen. Fady Qaddoura, a Democratic member of the State Budget Committee, thinks it should matter to Hoosiers how tax credits and grants are distributed.\n\u201c[The IEDC is] spending taxpayer dollars cutting deals day in, day out with very little level of transparency or oversight,\u201d Qaddoura said. \u201cThat billion plus dollars that the taxpayers have funded could have gone to their local schools, could have expanded child care or pre-K, could have paved our streets, could have reduced their taxes or fees imposed by government.\u201d\nQaddora emphasized that economic development initiatives aren\u2019t inherently bad if they\u2019re done right.\nTo that point, proponents of economic development incentives say the tax credits doled out to companies generate economic development and more high-wage job opportunities for Hoosiers. In fact, a report on 2021 job creation numbers from the IEDC shows that the state collected more in income taxes from the new jobs than the state spent on tax credits and grants.\nIn Gov. Eric Holcomb\u2019s opinion, the state is winning because of the IEDC.\n\u201cI think what separates IEDC from some of our competition \u2026 is that our board is members of the private sector who are scattered across the whole state of Indiana,\u201d Holcomb said following the IEDC\u2019s quarterly meeting in Goshen in September. \u201cThey represent regions, ecosystems,\u00a0 industries, sectors, and they come from the private sector. They get it.\u201d\nRules surrounding disclosures\nBefore the IEDC economic development deals were handled internally by employees at the Department of Commerce. That changed in 2005 when then Gov. Mitch Daniels created the IEDC and a board to govern it.\nTypically low-dollar projects don\u2019t need approval by the board, while those with a higher price tag are approved at the committee level. But when a potential conflict of interest is present, the deal is supposed to go to the full board for approval, according to IEDC rules.\nIndiana law requires nearly every state employee and appointee to abstain from participating in any decision or vote if that person has a financial interest in the outcome. They also are required to publicly notify the Ethics Commission of potential conflicts of interest each time one arises before contracts are awarded.\nBut, since at least 2013, IEDC board members haven\u2019t had to completely follow those disclosure rules. They\u2019re allowed to disclose potential conflicts long after contracts have been awarded, in order to avoid disclosing information on not-yet-public projects. Projects instead are assigned vague names when they\u2019re voted on, such as \u201cProject Grasslands\u201d or \u201cProject Amuse Bouches.\u201d Vaughn said that type of notification is \u201ca little too late.\u201d\n\u201cThe decisions have already been made,\u201d she said.\nWhatsmore, even when the beneficiaries of contracts have already been publicized, the IEDC appears to file conflict of interest disclosures well after the board votes.\nAt its September 2023 meeting, the IEDC board approved a $1 million tax break for Indianapolis-based Scale Computing. Thompson recused himself, sharing that he\u2019s an investor but more than a month later there\u2019s still no disclosure posted on the inspector general\u2019s website.\n\u201cConflict of interest disclosures are filed with the inspector general in due course, and the John Thompson disclosure you referenced will be reflected in our next filing,\u201d Sweitzer said in an email.\nAttempts to reach Thompson directly were unsuccessful.\nState Affairs and Fox59 found multiple projects since the IEDC\u2019s 2005 creation in which there was no conflict of interest form or formal opinion from the Ethics Commission posted on the state\u2019s website.\nMost of those projects were under previous administrations or occurred prior to a 2016 ethics policy change in which the IEDC tightened some of its rules. The IEDC declined to weigh in on why paperwork was sometimes not filed under previous IEDC leaders.\nHow board members\u2019 companies benefit\nIt\u2019s common for board members to recuse themselves due to potential conflicts of interest. At the four board meetings in 2018, there were six projects in which at least one board member had to recuse him or herself due to potential business ties to a project.\nSince 2015 when lawmakers updated state ethics laws, board members filed conflict of interest disclosures for 32 scenarios. Some of those documents disclosed indirect benefits, such as the IEDC awarding a tax credit to a project financed by a bank a board member leads; or an entity a board member\u2019s company regularly works with.\nFor example, in 2017 Mark Miles, president and chief executive officer of the organization that operates the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and Indycar, recused himself during a vote on a $900,000 grant to help Dallara USA Holdings Inc. develop a new racecar component for an IndyCar racing team.\nMiles said he never talked to any fellow board member about a conflict on any agenda that could have financially impacted him, nor did any board member talk to him about projects that might have benefited them.\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure who you would want to make judgments about incentives and programs for businesses that would have more insight than business people,\u201d Miles said. \u201cI just know [board members] to be people of integrity, who have not individually, or for their companies, profited to my knowledge, and I think they have acted in the best interest of the taxpayers.\u201d\nThere were other more direct financial benefits that did not show up on those conflict of interest disclosures, because they occurred prior to 2015. There was also no formal opinion from the Ethics Commission posted online, a state requirement prior to the 2015 law change.\nThe late-Dane Miller, co-founder of Biomet Inc., recused himself when his peers approved projects benefiting his company in 2006 and 2010, worth up to a collective $4.8 million in tax credits.\nLikewise between 2005-2010, the IEDC awarded Columbus-based Cummins at least $20 million worth of tax credits for economic development projects. A Cummins executive was on the IEDC board during that window, both recusing themselves when a Cummins project came up for a vote. Attempts to reach either were unsuccessful.\nAnd in 2009, the late-William Mays \u00a0signed a contract worth up to $48,500 with the IEDC on behalf of his company Mays Chemical Company while serving on the IEDC board. Meeting minutes provide no indication that the board voted on this contract.\nAside from simply following the ethics rules, Vaughn said conflicts could be avoided if governors simply appoint different people to the board. Right now, board members include bank executives, the chief executive officer of Indianapolis Motor Speedway, a former Eli Lilly head and the co-founder of Fair Oaks Farms.\n\u201cPerhaps there\u2019s just a real problem as to the pool of people they\u2019re bringing in,\u201d Vaughn said. \u201cIt would be better if they found folks that certainly were experts on the topic, but not eligible to receive this state money. The entire process seems to be set up to make it hard to avoid conflicts of interest.\u201d\nWatch the broadcast on Fox 59\u2019s YouTube channel.\nContact Kaitlin Lange on X @kaitlin_lange or email her at [email\u00a0protected].\nX @stateaffairsin\nFacebook @stateaffairsin\nInstagram @stateaffairsin\nLinkedIn\u00a0 @stateaffairs\nGet our free weekly newsletter that covers government, policy and politics that impact your everyday life\u2014in 5 minutes or less.\nSign Up\nUnlimited Access: Subscribe for just $2.99/mo billed monthly.\nGet unlimited news access\nAlready a member?

Eric Holcomb\u2019s administration. But it is rare for multiple Republicans to file such legislation and for that legislation to receive a committee hearing.\nHalf a dozen bills from Democrats and Republicans alike were filed this year to increase oversight of the IEDC.\nSome lawmakers, local elected leaders and other Hoosiers from Tippecanoe and Boone counties were unhappy with what they viewed as a lack of transparency from the IEDC in the early stages of the creation of the LEAP Innovation and Research District, designed to lure high-tech, high-wage companies to ready-to-build-on land.\nTo acquire the land for the 9,000-acre tech hub in Lebanon, the state \u00a0began buying up land years ago \u2014 well before some local Boone County leaders and the general public knew about plans for the district.\nFarther north, Tippecanoe County leaders have been outspoken about their opposition to the IEDC\u2019s plan to draw potentially tens of millions of gallons of water from the Wabash Alluvial Aquifer for the LEAP District. The IEDC has emphasized it will take water only if studies show a large withdrawal won\u2019t impact other water users, and it would be involved only if the agency attracted a large water-using company to the LEAP District.\nIn November, Holcomb announced the Indiana Finance Authority, another government agency, would take over the IEDC\u2019s water study. But Tippecanoe County leaders and some other lawmakers still want more guardrails in place.\n\u201cI have never seen an issue like this that resonated so much with an electorate and so much with all types of the public,\u201d said Sen. Spencer Deery, a West Lafayette Republican who co-authored Senate Bill 295 and filed legislation limiting large water withdrawals. \u201cA nerve has been struck here, and frankly it\u2019s because it hasn\u2019t unrolled in a way that\u2019s very conducive to trust.\u201d\nWhat Senate Bill 295 would do\nUnder Senate Bill 295, House Speaker Todd Huston, R-Fishers, and Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray, R-Martinsville, would each appoint a lawmaker to serve as advisory members on what would become a 14-person IEDC Board.\nBill author Sen. Brian Buchanan, a Republican who represents Lebanon, said most people in his community just have questions about the LEAP District. Further integrating the IEDC with lawmakers could help get more of those questions answered, he said.\n\u201cIt would help that communication gap, help maybe get out in front of an issue before it becomes a big issue,\u201d Buchanan said. \u201cI really think it could benefit both sides, and at the same time, our number one job is to protect the taxpayer and use taxpayer dollars wisely.\u201d\nThe bill also would require the IEDC to notify a county or municipality before it purchased land that exceeded 100 acres 30 days before the closing date. That requirement would improve the process for whatever the next innovation district the IEDC pursues, he said.\nWhat other IEDC legislation was filed?\nDeery and Rep. Sharon Negele, R-Attica, filed identical bills limiting large water withdrawals without approval and implementing caps. Both bills have multiple Republican co-authors, but neither has been scheduled for a hearing. With the deadline for bills to move out of committee approaching next week, time is running out.\nBray and Huston were reluctant to legislate on the topic of water before studies on the availability of water in the Wabash Alluvial Aquifer came back.\nDeery said the door isn\u2019t fully closed, but if any part of his bill is going to move forward, he\u2019ll likely have to promise substantial amendments. He also could work language into other bills later in the process.\n\u201cI\u2019ve still got a few cards to play,\u201d he said.\nRep. Ed DeLaney, D-Indianapolis, and Senate Democratic Leader Greg Taylor also filed legislation increasing IEDC oversight. DeLaney\u2019s bill would have established an economic development policy oversight commission, and Taylor\u2019s bill would have required the IEDC to share more information publicly, including data on which companies didn\u2019t meet its goals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very dangerous situation when a semi-independent agency can spend tens of millions of dollars on a project affecting several legislative districts and the legislators have no idea it\u2019s happening,\u201d DeLaney told State Affairs\u2019 reporting partner Fox59/CBS4. \u201cThat\u2019s bad. That\u2019s the core problem.\u201d\nAgain, neither bill has been scheduled for a committee hearing.\nAnother bill, filed by Rep. Robb Greene, R-Shelbyville, would prohibit the IEDC from entering into agreements in which any of the provisions are controversial.\nWhat State Affairs\u2019 previous reporting shows\nDeery and Buchanan said Senate Bill 295 specifically could act as a conversation starter when discussing issues related to the IEDC, such as those detailed in recent State Affairs reporting.\nState Affairs and Fox59/CBS4\u2019s ongoing investigation into the IEDC found that the agency has doled out tens of millions of dollars\u2019 worth of tax incentives and grants to companies linked to its governing board members.\nBuchanan said he asked the IEDC about the protections the agency has in place in those situations. For example, the IEDC has said board members recuse themselves from voting.\nReporting from the series also shows that the capital investment numbers the state shares likely don\u2019t paint an accurate picture of the actual investment numbers.\nHolcomb and the IEDC routinely share statistics on record-breaking job commitments and investment promises from companies before the projects begin. At the close of 2023, for example, Holcomb and the IEDC shared that his administration had secured a record-breaking $28.7 billion worth of committed capital investment from companies.\nBut the IEDC doesn\u2019t share how much money companies actually end up investing in Indiana. State Affairs asked for that number on Jan. 8 and did not receive a response from the IEDC or the governor.\nBut State Affairs found that at least one of every three projects in which a company committed to making a capital investment in exchange for a Hoosier Business Investment tax credit didn\u2019t meet its investment targets.\nThe IEDC disagreed with the characterization of the HBI tax credit, which the agency emphasized was only a small portion of the total toolkit of tax credits the IEDC uses to attract jobs and investment.\n\u201cTo be clear, not a single tax credit or dollar goes to a company without the company delivering on a committed investment to earn that tax credit or dollar,\u201d Secretary of Commerce David Rosenberg said in a statement. \u201c[It is] truly the definition of performance-based incentives, as we\u2019ve said many times. The implication there is taxpayer waste is false and intentionally misleading.\u201d\nState Affairs found that companies can receive their full tax credit before they meet investment commitment numbers listed in their contracts, due to ambiguous contract language.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nSenate Bill 295, which has two co-authors so far, still has a long way to go. Just because a bill gets a hearing doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019ll pass out of committee or gain approval from both chambers.\nBray and Huston have shared some reservations about legislation targeting the IEDC, specifically when it comes to the issues surrounding water access. But Bray did not shoot down Buchanan\u2019s bill.\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly something that\u2019s worthy of having a conversation about,\u201d Bray told reporters on Jan. 18.\nContact Kaitlin Lange on X @kaitlin_lange or email her at [email\u00a0protected].\nX @stateaffairsin\nFacebook @stateaffairsin\nInstagram @stateaffairsin\nLinkedIn\u00a0 @stateaffairs\nFormer Attorney General Curtis Hill today criticized Gov. Eric Holcomb and the Indiana Department of Health for no longer releasing terminated pregnancy reports through public records requests.\nState officials stopped releasing the terminated pregnancy reports submitted to the department after Aug. 1, 2023, according to a department spokesperson. The reports are \u201cwithheld pursuant to IC 5\u201314\u20133\u20134(a)(9), which declares medical records confidential,\u201d the spokesperson told State Affairs in an email.\nHill, a Republican gubernatorial candidate, argued in a news release that the department \u201cunilaterally made the decision\u201d to stop releasing the reports after Public Access Counselor Luke Britt issued an informal opinion in December concluding the reports \u201cshould be withheld from disclosure in their entirety.\u201d\nHill believes the department is \u201carrogantly disregarding the law\u201d and its decision \u201cdirectly contradicts the previous treatment\u201d of the reports.\nBut others claim the reports \u2014 which contain disaggregated data about individual abortions, such as the patient\u2019s age, marital status, race, education and the date and location of the abortion \u2014 could be used to determine who recently got an abortion, especially now that fewer abortions are being provided following the passage of Indiana\u2019s near-total abortion ban. Some also fear that providers who perform legal abortions under the state\u2019s strict ban could be targeted.\n\u201cThe IDOH is a bloated bureaucracy trying to avoid scrutiny for its lack of oversight of abortion providers and procedures,\u201d Hill said in the release. \u201cThe idea that data could be \u2018reverse engineered\u2019 to identify a patient is no more true now than it was before the passage of SB1 and is simply a cooked-up scheme to hide transparency.\u201d\nHill said in the release that Holcomb has \u201cthe ultimate authority to reign in his rogue health department, and I call on him to demand that his agency fall in line with state law and do the work it is statutorily obligated to do.\u201d\nA spokesperson for Holcomb did not respond to a request for comment.\nIndiana was the first state to pass an abortion ban after the Supreme Court of the United States overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022. But two legal challenges to the ban from the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana are still underway.\nThe state is still required to track abortions after its near-total abortion ban went into effect, and the department continues to publish quarterly, aggregated abortion data. Doctors reported 698 abortions during July 2023, but Indiana doctors reported performing fewer than three abortions a week during the initial weeks after the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban took effect.\nContact Jarred Meeks on X\u00a0@jarredsmeeks\u00a0or email him at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected].\nX\u00a0@StateAffairsINFacebook\u00a0@stateaffairsinInstagram\u00a0@stateaffairsinLinkedIn\u00a0@stateaffairspro\nIndiana dropped another 28,142 Hoosiers from its Medicaid rolls in December, as the state nears the end of its \u201cunwinding\u201d effort. Indiana has now disenrolled 330,413 Hoosiers from Medicaid coverage since the start of the process.\u00a0 State officials have said about 400,000 would likely be dropped by May. The slight over-the-month increase comes as fewer \u2026\nDemocrats are touting a new poll showing sizable majorities of Indiana residents supporting marijuana legalization and abortion rights in their ongoing push for citizen ballot initiatives such as those allowed in other states.\nPolling results released this week by Ball State University\u2019s Bowen Center for Public Affairs found 86% support for some form of marijuana legalization and 59% support for allowing abortions in most or all cases.\nThose results from the center\u2019s 2023 Hoosier Survey are similar to the previous year when 85% supported marijuana legalization for medical or personal use and 57% supported abortion rights in at least most cases.\nBallot initiative push stymied by Republicans\nRepublican legislative leaders have refused to take up proposals from Democrats over the past several years for citizen ballot initiatives while pushing through the state\u2019s near-total abortion ban in 2022 and blocking efforts for any marijuana legalization.\nSenate and House Democrats have filed legislation this General Assembly session for amending the state constitution to create a process by which petition drives that gather enough voter signatures could place issue questions on the general election ballot.\nSuch a process in Ohio resulted in voters there approving in November a constitutional amendment protecting abortion access and a law legalizing medical marijuana.\nIndiana is among 12 states still with full marijuana bans as Republican Gov. Eric Holcomb and Republican legislative leaders have cited concerns about both its legality at the federal level and the impact on public safety and health.\nSenate Democratic Leader Greg Taylor said the views of Hoosiers on marijuana and abortion were being \u201cconsistently ignored\u201d by the Legislature\u2019s Republican supermajority.\n\u201cWhen our laws directly conflict with what Hoosiers want, there\u2019s no question that ballot measures are necessary in Indiana,\u201d Taylor said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the will and the wishes of we the people, the Hoosiers of the state of Indiana, to finally be realized and finally start to take precedence.\u201d\nPoll details on marijuana and abortion questions\nThe Hoosier Survey poll found that on marijuana legalization:\nOn the abortion question:\nRepublican legislative leaders have opposed adding citizen ballot initiatives based on the argument that General Assembly members are elected every two or four years, giving voters ample opportunity to weigh in on such issues.\nRepublicans haven\u2019t advanced any abortion-related legislation as court challenges continue to the abortion ban that took effect last year.\nNo change in Republican stance on marijuana\nRepublican Senate President Pro Tem Rodric Bray said legislators are continuing to discuss matters surrounding marijuana legalization but was clear it wasn\u2019t happening this year.\n\u201cNo, it\u2019s not going to be the case but we\u2019re continuing to look at that,\u201d Bray said last week. \u201cWe\u2019ve got several bills and there will be some conversation.\u201d\nDemocratic Rep. Sue Errington of Muncie, who sponsored a ballot initiative resolution in the House, said the Ball State poll showed Republicans doing \u201cthe exact opposite of what the Hoosier majority wants.\u201d\n\u201cThe data is clear, Hoosiers want access to abortions and cannabis legalization,\u201d Errington said. \u201cAnd yet, Republicans continue to go against the will of the majority with their restrictive policies.\u201d\nTom Davies is a Statehouse reporter for\u00a0State Affairs Pro Indiana.

But Democrats on the committee expressed deep reservations about the agency\u2019s requests, which included an additional $97 million for land acquisition and site improvements for the LEAP Innovation and Research District in Boone County.\n\u201cA lack of transparency and communication with us has really created a cloud that made us question some of these deals,\u201d said Sen. Fady Qaddoura, D-Indianapolis.\nThe money will come from an IEDC\u00a0$500 million deal-closing fund\u00a0that was approved by state lawmakers in this year\u2019s budget, but the IEDC needed the State Budget Committee\u2019s blessing to move forward with the transactions.\nThe IEDC plans to offer $100 million in performance-based incentive grants for a $4.1 billion advanced manufacturing facility that is expected to result in 2,700 jobs. The undisclosed company is considering multiple locations across the state for its project, which was given the code name \u201cNora,\u201d though the LEAP District is not one of them, IEDC Senior Vice President Mark Wasky told the committee.\nThe committee also approved the agency\u2019s ask for $80 million in incentives for a tech company that plans to invest $3.1 billion into a facility to manufacture advanced electrical components, a project that is expected to create 800 new jobs, Wasky said.\nThe code name for that development is Project Mars, he said.\nIndiana\u00a0set a new record this year\u00a0for committed capital investments made by companies doing business here, according to the IEDC. The agency said it has secured $28.7 billion in new capital expenditures in 2023, a 29% increase over the $22.2 billion from the previous year.\nLEAP requests approved\nThe committee also approved the agency\u2019s request to spend $71 million to acquire roughly 750 acres of land that is already under option in Boone County for the LEAP District to support an estimated $800 million investment in the first phase of a company\u2019s multibillion-dollar information technology center project.\nThe land is located in the northern end of the LEAP District, Wasky said.\nThe IEDC has spent nearly $300 million on land acquisitions for the LEAP District in Boone County, paying on average between $75,000 to $80,000 per acre for mostly farmland, according to sales disclosure forms.\nThe average price of farmland in Indiana is around $13,000 an acre, according to\u00a0Purdue University.\nRep. Ed Delaney, D-Indianapolis, questioned whether the IEDC would be able to sell the land for a similar price it was purchased for.\n\u201cYou\u2019re overpaying for the ground. Do you think manufacturers will want to overpay for the same ground?\u201d Delaney asked.\n\u201cWe continue to work through the specifics of the sale price and believe that we\u2019ll be able to satisfy the tenets of the fund and get a return on our investment,\u201d Wasky replied, referring to the IEDC\u2019s site strategies fund.\nThe committee also agreed to release $26 million in funds to support ongoing infrastructure investments, including roadway improvements, fiber extension and other utility needs, for the LEAP District.\nMost Popular Stories\nEvansville area businesses among best places to work in manufacturing\nIt\u2019s time to let voters weigh in on reproductive freedom in Indiana\nIndiana coalition to invest in apprenticeship system\nCalifornia company sets up med-tech office in Warsaw\nQ&A with Rep.

Additionally, it enacted a number of priorities designed to make Indiana more competitive, such as creating a new $500 million deal closing fund, providing additional resources for mega-deals over $5 billion, creating a new site acquisition fund for shovel-ready development, increasing funding for Manufacturing Readiness Grants and allocating another $500 million to expand quality of place and quality of life investments through the Indiana Regional Economic Acceleration and Development Initiative.\nGrowing a global economy: The IEDC also supported another robust year for foreign direct investment, with 37 foreign-owned businesses based across 17 countries committing to locating or growing in Indiana. Together, these firms plan to invest more than $20.6 billion (+184% from 2022) and create more than 8,509 new jobs (+34.8% from 2022) with average wages of $39.98/hour (+36% from 2022). Of these commitments, 18 are international businesses locating in Indiana for the first time, accounting for $5.3 billion in planned capital investment.\nThis includes notable announcements from companies such as Canadian Solar (Canada), Isotopia USA (Israel), Bastian Solutions (Japan), Bila Solar (Singapore), Endress+Hauser (Switzerland), and Arrow McLaren (UK).\nMaking Indiana investment-ready: Indiana continues to prioritize site development efforts, ensuring the state is able to offer competitive sites and help companies invest and launch operations more quickly. Through the Strategic Sites Initiative, the IEDC is partnering with local communities to identify and prepare new sites; so far, the state has identified 417 new, nationally competitive sites ranging from 30-3,000 acres each.\nAdditionally, momentum continues to build at the LEAP Research and Innovation District in Lebanon. In April 2023, the state broke ground on the site\u2019s first project \u2013 a $3.7 billion investment from Eli Lilly and Company to establish two manufacturing operations that will create up to 700 new jobs. The IEDC has more than $58 billion of potential investments in the pipeline for the site.\nEntrepreneurship & Innovation\nBuilding a nationally recognized ecosystem: Indiana\u2019s leadership in innovation and entrepreneurship continues to grow. Indiana was named the No. 1 state to start a business in 2023 by Forbes, and the state\u2019s venture market surpassed $1 billion for the second consecutive year in 2022, ranking No. 2 for deal activity in the Great Lakes and Midwestern regions. Additionally, Indiana was named the 2025 host for the Global Entrepreneurship Congress \u2013 only the second U.S. location to host the annual convention in the event\u2019s history.\nDriving U.S. innovation and manufacturing: Indiana secured three new federal tech hub designations \u2013 defying the odds despite a 0.01% chance of winning all three. These hubs will bring new opportunities for investment, innovation, supply chain growth and job creation across technology, hydrogen energy and microelectronics, supporting critical U.S. initiatives to advance innovation, accelerate the energy transition and re-shore supply chains.\nInvesting in entrepreneurs and small businesses: The IEDC is leaning into entrepreneurship in unprecedented ways, assisting a record number \u2013 more than 10,000 \u2013 of entrepreneurs and small businesses in 2023 through various initiatives, investments and incentives. The IEDC launched a new $1 billion capital access initiative to provide credit and equity to Hoosier entrepreneurs; committed another $2 million to growing localized, no-cost support for small businesses; and celebrated the second edition of Entrepreneurship Indiana, an annual publication honoring the entrepreneurial journey and highlighting 100 Hoosier success stories.\nThe IEDC works to support entrepreneurs and small businesses through the Indiana Small Business Development Center and Indiana APEX. While final data is still being compiled from all regional offices, the Indiana SBDC provided no-cost support to more than 6,396 entrepreneurs and small businesses in 2023, helping secure $96,769,188 million in funding and helping launch 451 new businesses. Additionally, Indiana APEX served 180 new clients, with a majority (62%) qualifying as women-, minority- or veteran-owned business enterprises, helping businesses secure more than $335 million in federal government contracts.\nLaunching and expanding entrepreneurial resources: In July, the IEDC launched ConnectIND, a digital portal available in 11 languages to increase support for entrepreneurs and founders. The first-of-its-kind statewide listing of resources, programs and services for entrepreneurs is designed to connect current and aspiring entrepreneurs to the right resources at the right time, providing visitors with curated connections to Indiana\u2019s robust network of support organizations, mentors, accelerators, capital opportunities and more. Since launching in June, ConnectIND has registered 1,000 users and garnered 22,000 unique site visitors, over 44,000 site views and over 30,000 sessions.\nThe IEDC also expanded accelerator support of early-stage startups with a record 7 gBETA accelerators supporting 40 entrepreneurs and continued support for Sports Tech HQ\u2019s Techstars accelerator supporting 13 companies and sponsorship of HG Ventures HardTech Accelerator showcase.\nFueling venture development: As the #1 most active venture capital in the Great Lakes Region, the IEDC partners with Elevate Ventures to provide assistance to high-growth, high-potential startups and innovators, making capital more accessible and attracting additional private co-investment. In 2023, Elevate Ventures committed to investing more than $21.7 million in 112 Indiana companies through investment and grant programs utilizing the state\u2019s 21st Century Research and Technology Fund. Since inception, and across all programs, Elevate Ventures has invested $172.1 million in Hoosier businesses, attracting $2.2 billion in capital from other sources (12.8-to-1 investment leverage ratio).\nCommunity Development\nIncreasing Community Development: The IEDC marked a major READI milestone, awarding regions over $487 million of the initiative\u2019s original $500 million. These funds will support 361 unique quality of place, quality of life, quality of opportunity and workforce projects and programs across all 17 Indiana READI regions. The state\u2019s initial appropriation is being matched by additional public, private and nonprofit dollars, resulting in a combined $12.6 billion (26:1 investment leverage ratio) invested in Indiana\u2019s communities.\nAdditionally, the state is allocating another $500 to the program through READI 2.0 to accelerate population growth and key quality of life indicators such as per capita income, career opportunities and educational attainment.\nInvesting in rural communities: The IEDC launched a Community Collaboration Fund in 2023 designed to grow the state\u2019s entrepreneurial network in rural communities; the Indiana SBDC supported the launch of 179 new businesses and supported 5,283 jobs in rural counties in 2022 and 2023; and the Manufacturing Readiness Grant program has awarded grants to 152 small- and medium-sized business in rural counties since its inception in 2020, resulting in $312 million in capital improvements.\nAccelerating vibrancy, growth in Indiana\u2019s capital city: The IEDC served as a thought partner and supporter in two major developments in 2023 that are poised to bring new life to Indianapolis. In June, Indiana University and Purdue University signed an historic agreement to separate IUPUI, creating two separate and independent campuses in Indianapolis led by each of the globally respected universities and research institutes. The change will allow both universities to implement their own visions and establish new aspirations unique to their own strengths in order to meet the needs of an increasingly interconnected global economy.\nAnd, earlier this month, Circle Centre Mall development plans were announced that will revitalize the heart of downtown Indianapolis, with Hendricks Commercial Properties purchasing and leading a $600 million mixed-use redevelopment featuring housing, offices, entertainment, modern retail space and open-air spaces.\nExternal Engagement\nEnhancing Indiana\u2019s global reputation: Gov. Holcomb and the IEDC continued a commitment to advancing global engagement and international partnerships, building new partnerships and fostering relationships abroad on Governor- and IEDC-led trips to Japan, South Korea, Portugal, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, the UAE and Australia. The state is also hosting the second iteration of its Indiana Global Economic Summit in May, building off the success of the inaugural event in 2022 that convened more than 800 registrants and 30 international delegations.\nTelling Indiana\u2019s bold story: In 2023, Indiana expanded and created new partnerships to better share its story nationally and globally as a bold state that is innovating and building the economy of the future. The IEDC shared the state\u2019s story at major events, including the Consumer Electronics Show in partnership with the Indy Autonomous Challenge, the InterBattery Conference in South Korea, and at Inc. 5000 in Austin, highlighting the state\u2019s economy and competitive advantages to key sectors.\nIn the fall, the IEDC rolled out a new brand \u2013 Indiana for the Bold \u2013 to reflect the state\u2019s economic success and elevate Indiana\u2019s identity and reputation across the world. Forthcoming campaigns will highlight Indiana\u2019s economic environment and strengths; a strong business outlook; advancements across infrastructure, industry and innovation; and a ready workforce, showcasing Indiana\u2019s true readiness for the future.\nIn order to continue this momentum and advance economic development opportunities for years to come, the IEDC is committed to continuing executing its strategic vision focused on advancing innovation and entrepreneurship, ensuring a diverse economic environment, creating the jobs of tomorrow, and retaining and attracting top talent by investing in quality of place.\nHave news to share?\nOur subscribers crave the latest Indiana tech news.\nMore Related Stories\n1210 Waterway BlvdSuite 5000Indianapolis, IN 46202\ncomms@techpoint.org\n317.275.2080"

        "raw_content": "Indiana Economic Development Corporation reports nearly $29B in 2023 investments\nBy Whitney Downard | Indiana Capital Chronicle\nFor The Republic\nINDIANAPOLIS \u2014 The Indiana Economic Development Corporation (IEDC) and top state leaders touted its 2023 successes as the year closed, claiming a \u201cseventh consecutive record-breaking year\u201d of investments and business commitments that included nearly $29 billion in investments from 208 companies.\nThe quasi-governmental organization had a major leadership change in 2023, with Brad Chambers stepping down as Secretary of Commerce in August after two years to run for governor.\nHis successor, David Rosenberg, hailed commitments from \u201chigh-growth industries,\u201d such as semiconductor and electric vehicle manufacturers as well as clean energy producers in a Wednesday release.\n\u201cIndiana is thinking long-term and taking bold action to put Indiana at the forefront of critical innovations and to create a more prosperous future for Hoosiers,\u201d said Rosenberg. \u201c\u2026 Paired with unprecedented investments in entrepreneurship and quality of life, Hoosiers can look forward to more supportive and vibrant communities, more in-demand career opportunities and more opportunities to create generational change.\u201d\nNumbers from the annual report are regularly used by supporters to defend spending taxpayer dollars on often secretive business deals and hefty spot bonuses. The entity faces unprecedented pushback due to the LEAP development in Boone County, including the use of state dollars to purchase farmland above market value and the need for hundreds of millions of gallons of water piped in from Tippecanoe County.\nThe lengthy IEDC release said 208 companies committed to locating or expanding in the state for a combined investment of over $28.7 billion, a 29% increase from 2022\u2019s $22.2 billion. Those promises include the creation of 21,866 new jobs with an average hourly wage of $36.07 or $75,025 annually \u2014 3.9% higher than 2022\u2019s efforts and 10.2% higher than the national average wage.\nThose numbers are the highest reported for the agency since it was established in 2005.\n\u201cIndiana is achieving unprecedented economic momentum that will catapult economic and community opportunities for Hoosiers for decades to come,\u201d said Gov. Eric Holcomb in the release. \u201cOur efforts to attract new investments and jobs, catalyze entrepreneurship and invest in quality of place are paying dividends \u2013 all while advancing high-tech industries to ensure that Indiana is at the center of tomorrow\u2019s global economy.\u201d\nHowever, according to a 2023 analysis of employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 91 of Indiana\u2019s 92 counties made less than the $70,343 national average wage \u2014 despite more than a decade of IEDC efforts.\nIn particular, the IEDC report highlighted recent and somewhat controversial moves from the General Assembly to expand its \u201ctoolkit,\u201d including a site development fund and land acquisition fund \u2014 both of which have been used to purchase and develop land in Boone County for potential investors.\nThe IEDC said it had identified 417 \u201cnationally competitive\u201d sites throughout the state, ranging from 30 acres to 3,000 acres. Eli Lilly, the only announced tenant for the LEAP project, broke ground on its facility in April with a promised $3.7 billion investment but the IEDC claimed it had another $58 in potential investment \u201cin the pipeline for the site.\u201d\nLawmakers also earmarked $500 million for a deal closing fund to provide incentives for companies and $500 million for an additional round of READI grants for local development.\nThirty-seven foreign-owned businesses across 17 countries make up $20.6 billion of the investments, a 184% increase from 2022, and account for 8,509 of the planned new jobs with an hourly wage of $39.98. Of those, 18 businesses are new to Indiana.\nCompanies include: renewable energy manufacturer Canadian Solar, Israeli pharmaceutical company Isotopia USA, Japanese logistics company Bastian Solutions, Singapore solar energy startup Bila Solar, Swiss manufacturer Endress+Hauser and racecar company Arrow McLaren, of the United Kingdom.\nThe state\u2019s venture market surpassed $1 billion for the second consecutive year and Indiana was named the 2025 host for the Global Entrepreneurship Congress \u2014 only the second time the United States has hosted the annual event.\nThe IEDC said it assisted more than 10,000 entrepreneurs and small businesses and launched a $1 billion capital access initiative to provide credit and equity to entrepreneurs while committing another $2 million to growing small businesses.\nThrough the Indiana Small Business Development Center, the IEDC helped 6,396 entrepreneurs and small businesses secure nearly $97 million in funding and launch 451 new businesses. In 2022 and 2023, the center supported the launch of 179 businesses in rural communities with 5,283 new jobs.\nIndiana APEX served 180 new clients \u2014 62% of which qualified as women-, minority- or veteran-owned enterprises \u2014 which secured more than $335 million in federal government contracts.\nOn the community development side, the IEDC awarded more than $487 million in the first round of READI funds to 361 projects with additional public, private and nonprofit matches bringing in a combined $12.6 billion in investments.\n\u2014 The Indiana Capital Chronicle covers state government and the state legislature.

This first-of-its-kind statewide listing of resources, programs and services for entrepreneurs is designed to connect current and aspiring entrepreneurs to the right resources at the right time, providing visitors with curated connections to Indiana\u2019s robust network of support organizations, mentors, accelerators, capital opportunities and more.\u00a0Since launching in July, ConnectIND has registered 900 users and garnered 7,000 unique site visitors, nearly 22,000 site views, and over 11,000 sessions.The IEDC will celebrate these initiatives and Indiana\u2019s entrepreneurs at three regional Global Entrepreneurship Week events this week, hosting founders, aspiring entrepreneurs and industry mentors.\nThe events* will be held as follows:\nIndiana\u00a0is committed to investing in the growth and\u00a0success of the state\u2019s entrepreneurial ecosystem, which continues to inspire entrepreneurs, fuel innovations, create quality jobs for Hoosiers and attract record levels of capital investment. Last year, Indiana ranked No. 1 among the\u00a0Best States to Start a Business by Forbes\u00a0and\u00a0has been recognized as a top 40 global emerging destination for entrepreneurship by the Global Entrepreneurship Network and its partners at Startup Genome, while Indianapolis has been named the No. 3 city in the Midwest for startups for the second year in a row.\nThe state's entrepreneurial ecosystem has a significant impact on the state's economy and its communities. Indiana's youngest companies (under five years of age) account for most of the state's net new job growth, creating more than 36,000 new jobs in 2019 alone. In 2021, Hoosier companies under five years of age contributed an estimated $11.5 billion to Indiana\u2019s GDP. At the local level, one successful new company increases the median household income of surrounding households, driving community well-being.\nNominations are currently being accepted for the 2024 edition of Entrepreneurship Indiana.
