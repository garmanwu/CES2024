From the partnership of Daiwa, with its parent company U.S. Jaclean, and the Shanghai-based Rotai comes the Daiwa Supreme Hybrid Massage Chair. What\u2019s so special about being the product of a collaboration between these two companies? Daiwa and Rotai have introduced a new category in the existing consumer massage chair market. The Supreme Hybrid Massage Chair is not your typical inversion stretch massage chair. It is a level-up version with a flexible massage track that arches backward over 50 degrees and an L-shaped massage track with full coverage of 49 inches giving a full-body deep stretch of a yoga exercise.\nForbes Vetted\n\"The Best Massage Chairs To Help You Relax And Unwind At Home\"\nBest Hybrid Massage Chair. A Massage Pod That You Can Immerse Yourself In. The Daiwa Supreme Hybrid Massage Chair is notoriously pricey, clocking in at $13,500. While that price tag might seem unreasonable, a few things set the Daiwa Supreme Hybrid massage chair apart from other, more affordable options. For starters, it performs a 3D full-body at the start of each session to map your back and deliver an experience that best matches your spine. The chair combines an inversion stretch (like a gentle yoga move) with the multi-stroke six roller system for a deeper massage. It also has heat therapy throughout as well as Bluetooth speakers and charging ports, which make you feel encased in a private world. There\u2019s also an integrated touchscreen tablet that serves as a control panel for customizing your massage.\nCSQ C-Suite Quarterly Magazine\n\"The Best of CES\"\nDaiwa Supreme Hybrid Massage Chair This massage chair, with a FullBodyReach MultiStroke system, is a fulfilling replacement for a masseuse. Its 3-D massage-roller design separates the upper and lower massaging arms, with one focusing on the upper back, shoulders, and neck, while the other simultaneously massages the lower back and legs. This holistic treatment combines stretching, heat, compression massage, and reflexology, and saw attendees lining up en masse.
