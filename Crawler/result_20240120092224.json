From state-of-the-art AI-powered assistants and smart home systems to virtual reality headsets and intelligent wearables, the show floor was buzzing with innovation. Attendees were treated to live demos of feature-rich gadgets that seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, enhancing productivity, entertainment, and overall user experience.\nOne of the major highlights of CES 2024 was the remarkable progress in Qi2 technology. As wireless charging continues its growth in popularity, the technology was prominently featured through new product launches and partnership announcements from industry leaders. It was at this global stage that Trusda debuted their updated portfolio of wireless charging solutions.\nWireless charging allows devices to receive power over inductive magnetic fields without physically plugging into a power outlet. This is made possible through a technology called inductive power transfer. The Qi(pronounced /t\u0283i\u02d0/ CHEE) standard, developed by the Wireless Power Consortium(WPC), is the most widely adopted specification for inductive wireless charging. It ensures devices from different manufacturers are compatible as long as they support Qi, The original Qi standard supports 5W output.\nOn April 19, 2023, Wireless Power Consortium released the Qi2 standard. and it brings important upgrades over the original Qi standard. (Qi2 is based on Apple\u2019s MagSafe technology, Apple was involved in developing the Qi2 standard.)\nSeamless Integration and Expanded Ecosystem:\nOne of the standout features of Qi2 is its ability to seamlessly integrate into a wide range of consumer electronics. From smartphones and tablets to smartwatches and earbuds, Qi2-enabled devices can effortlessly tap into the wireless charging ecosystem. CES 2024 witnessed numerous flagship devices adopting Qi2, emphasizing its growing industry support and consumer demand. This expanded ecosystem ensures a universal and hassle-free charging experience for users across multiple devices.\nUnparalleled Charging Speed and Efficiency:\nQi2's technological advancements have revolutionized charging speeds, making it faster and more efficient than ever before. With higher power transfer capabilities, Qi2-enabled devices can charge at an accelerated rate, reducing overall charging time. This leap in efficiency ensures that users can quickly replenish their devices' power, granting them more time to stay connected and productive.\nEnhanced Safety and Compatibility:\nQi2 places a strong emphasis on safety and compatibility, addressing concerns that have previously hindered wireless charging adoption. Through rigorous testing and certification processes, Qi2 offers enhanced protection against overcharging, overheating, and foreign object detection. Moreover, Qi2's compatibility with a wide range of devices, regardless of brand or model, ensures a seamless charging experience for users across various platforms.\nAs one of the leading wireless charging manufacturers, we showcased our new products about Qi2. Our newest product lineup delivered not only increased charging speeds but also higher charging capacities compared to previous generations.\nStar products on display include CW005 car and home wireless charging pad. Small and compact at just 60.3mm in diameter and 15.3mm thick, the CW005 connects to a bracket that can be mounted in a vehicle's air vent for stable charging even on bumpy roads, The 11N weight capacity ensures stable charging. When not in the car, the removable bracket allows for portable use or lightweight home placement without taking up much space. Refined aesthetics and a technological design deliver up to 15W of output in a stylish package.\nAnother popular product displayed was the LS2i.M/LS2C.M, a compact Qi2 magnetic wireless power bank. Integrated with either a USB-C or Lightning cable, this portable battery features an eco-friendly housing as Trusda is committed to environmental responsibility and has achieved RCS certification. We believe in sustainable practices and the concept of recyclability. The LS2i.M/LS2C.M includes a foldable stand allowing for hands-free use at any angle, measuring a mere 106.5x69x18.5mm. Featuring lithium battery protection circuits, it provides overflow, over-discharge, overload and short circuit protection for safe charging, This power bank ensures stable wireless power transfer to compatible smartphones and accessories.\nSara Liu, Marketing director of Trusda, commented, \"We are pleased to debut our latest generation of Qi2 products at CES 2024. As wireless charging continues to grow in popularity among consumers seeking convenient cord-free power solutions, our goal is to deliver seamless and optimized charging experiences through continuous innovation.\"\nPopular areas at this CES include smart home, healthcare, new technologies and emerging AR/VR fields, prospects for wireless power as a universal energy distribution platform become increasingly viable. CES help energize this developing ecosystem by connecting all stakeholders - from engineers to manufacturers to forward-thinking brands.\nOverall CES 2024 saw the rise of Qi2 and shorter charging times through innovations from across the industry. For Trusda, it was an opportunity to engage global customers and showcase why we remain at the forefront of the wireless power revolution. With their latest lineup of Qi2 chargers and power banks, consumers can expect faster and more versatile charging well into the future.\n2018 Iran International Electronics Show\nRelated Article\nTEL: +86 755-8296 6390\nFAX: +86 755-2824 4681\nE-MAIL: sales@trusda.com\nADD:\n201-301, Building 4, Lianchuang Technology Park,No.21, Bulan Road, Nanwan Street, Longgang District,Shenzhen, Guangdong, China\nCATEGORIES\nHome\nOur Qualification\nProduct\nPower Bank\nOutdoor\nMagnetic Series\nLaptop Power Bank\nWireless Charger\nGaN Adapter\nCompany\nCompany Profile\nCertificates\nOEM/ODM\nFAQs\nExhibition\nNews\nCompany News\nIndustry News\nMORE DETAILS\nIf you have any enquiry about Products, please feel free to email us at E-mail or use the following enquiry form.\nContact Us\nSitemap\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 SHENZHEN TRUSDA INDUSTRIAL CO., LTD.- www.trusda.com.cn All Rights Reserved."

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Free Guides\nFree Webinar\nApple MFi Licensed Manufacturers in China: A Complete Guide\nDo you plan to import accessories for iPhone, iPad or other Apple devices? Then you need to make sure that your product comply with the Apple MFi licensing requirements.\nIn this article, I answer some of the most common questions about MFi licenses when importing Apple accessories from China:\na. Should the importer or the factory obtain the MFi license?\nb. Which products require an MFi license?\nc. Which products to not require an MFi license?\nd. How can I find a licensed supplier on Globalsources.com or Alibaba.com?\nWhat is the Apple MFi program?\nMFi stands for \u2018Made for iPhone, iPad or iPod. If you own an Apple device, you\u2019ve probably seen the \u2018Made for iPhone and iPad\u2019 label on power banks, headphones and other accessories.\nApple MFi is a licensing program that brands and manufacturers can become part of, in order to label electronic accessories as \u2018Made for iPhone or iPad\u2019.\nA few examples follow below:\nThe program is also mandatory if you want to import accessories compatible with Apple HomeKit, GymKit, CarPlay or AirPlay.\nA supplier, or importer, that is not part of the Apple MFi program is not allowed to add the \u2018Made for\u2019 label on its products, or even use Apple licensed technology such as the following:\na. Magnetic Charging Module\nb. Lightning Audio Module\nc. Lightning Analog Headset Module\nThe full list can be found here. However, notice that MFi is not required for non-Apple technologies, such as Bluetooth.\nFREE CONSULTATION SESSION\nSCHEDULE FREE CONSULTATION (30 MIN)\nWhat\u2019s the purpose of the MFi program?\nThe point of the MFi program is to set technical standards that ensure product safety and compatibility with Apple devices. It also generates revenue for Apple itself.\nNon-MFi certified accessories, such as chargers or earphones, can still be compatible with Apple devices. That said, many non-certified (MFi or other) chargers sold in the US and Europe are unsafe, and prone to explosion.\nHence, there is a need to ensure that accessories meet certain safety standards.\u00a0If you want to import Apple accessories from China, you should only consider MFi licensed manufacturers.\nShould the Importer or the Chinese manufacturer be MFi licensed?\nBoth. There are actually two types of MFi licenses:\na. MFi Development Licensee (Importer)\nb. MFi Manufacturing Licensee (Chinese supplier)\nHence, you need to obtain an MFi Development license, as you get to work on the product specification and prototype.\nOnce you start sourcing suppliers, you must limit your selection to suppliers that are already Apple MFi Manufacturer licensed.\nObtaining a developer license is not enough. Both you and the factory must be licensed.\nApple is not charging for the MFi program at this time, but you must have a legal entity (i.e., a registered business) and pass their screening process to enroll.\nAlso notice that each SKU (Product) must be MFi certified by the manufacturer. Once the product is certified, it will appear in the official list of Apple MFi certified accessories.\nHow does Apple MFi affect product design?\nWhen you apply for an MFi Development License, you will get to sign an NDA with Apple.\nAt this stage, they will review your specifications, and provide technical support, sample components, product testing and other guidance:\nAs a developer, you will work directly with Apple, to ensure that the product is fully compliant and compliant with their requirements.\nOnce you have a complete MFi approved product specification, you can take it to an MFi licensed manufacturer in China.\nIs MFi manufacturer licenses common among Chinese suppliers?\nNo. Only a small fraction of all electronics manufacturers in China are part of the MFi program. There are various reasons for this:\nI\u2019d say that less than 0.1% of all manufacturers are part of the MFi program, so you have to look specifically for a licensed factory.\nHow do I know if a supplier is MFi licensed?\nApple lists all MFi licensed manufacturers on its website. If a supplier claims to be an MFi licensed factory, they will appear on that list.\nIf they are not on that list, they are not part of the program.\nApply this protocol when sourcing MFi licensed suppliers:\n1. Is the factory specialized in manufacturing the type of products I am looking for?\n2. Do they claim to be Apple MFi Manufacturer licensed?\n3. Is the supplier listed on the Apple website as MFi Manufacturer Licensed?\nNotice that even MFi licensed factories are specialized in certain product categories. If you\u2019re importing power banks, you must look for an MFi licensed power bank manufacturer.\nThere are no \u2018all round\u2019 MFi manufacturers that make all kinds of Apple accessories.\nList of Apple MFi suppliers in China\nThe full list of Apple MFi licensees can only be found on the official Apple website. For the record, that list is confidential, and only accessible if you sign a digital NDA.\nHowever, we managed to find a few suppliers who claim to be MFi certified on their website or company pages on supplier directories.\nNotice that we have not verified if these suppliers actually are MFi licensees, and we are not affiliated with any of the listed companies.\nMost MFi licensed suppliers in China are based in Guangdong province, which is the global center for electronics manufacturing.\nCan I source Apple MFi licensed suppliers on Globalsources.com and Alibaba.com?\nYes, there are at least a few hundred MFi licensed suppliers listed on Globalsources.com and Alibaba.com.\nMFi licensed suppliers clarify their status. Below follows one example from Globalsources:\nGlobalsources.com is an ideal sourcing platform for finding MFi licensed manufacturers\nThe easiest way to find MFi licensed suppliers on these sites is to type \u2018MFi\u2019 followed by the product name. A few examples follow below:\nJust keep in mind that you must verify if the supplier is actually listed on the official MFi list of manufacturers.\nDo\u00a0 need an MFi license If I import a private label product?\nNo, an MFi developer license is not required if you intend to import private label products. In other words, you can brand a private label product (i.e., charger or power bank) with your own logo, and use the MFi label on the packaging.\nHowever, this requires that the supplier has an MFi manufacturer license.\nFurther, if you make any change to the ODM product, you must obtain a development license. Such changes include the following:\nIn other words, you are not allowed to make any changes to the private label product.\nCan I buy Apple device compatible accessories from non-licensed suppliers?\nUsing Apple licensed technology and components (i.e., the lighting connectors) requires that both the importer and the factory are part of the MFi licensing program. There are no exemptions.\nHowever, an MFi license is not required for the following:\nFREE CONSULTATION SESSION\nSCHEDULE FREE CONSULTATION (30 MIN)\nProduct Import Toolkit 2024\nAll the tools you need to successfully manufacture and import products from China, Vietnam, India & Thailand.\nTutorials (View)\nPart 1: Design & specification\nPart 2: Supplier sourcing\nPart 3: Product samples\nPart 4: Placing your order\nDocument Templates (View)\n+ Product Specification\n+ Production Manual\n+ Quality Checklists\nService Booking\n+ Quality Control\n(View)\n+ Lab Testing\n(View)\n+ Shipping\nImport Tax Guides\n(View)\n+ United States\n+ European Union/UK\n+ Australia\nProduct Compliance Tool\n+ Value USD 99\nOnline Support (View)\n+\nGet your questions answered\nSupplier Lists (PDF) (View)\n+\nList of 4-8 verified suppliers\nLifetime Access\nLifetime Access\nCo-founder of Asiaimportal (HK) Limited and based in Hong Kong.
