WICOP Pixel is recognized for its topnotch technology to deliver microLED display in the form of one chip without wire and package.\n\u2018WICOP Pixel\u2019 is based on WICOP technology, which does not require wire bonding, packaging or lens. It is the\u00a0world\u2019s first RGB one-chip technology that stacks three RGB microLEDs vertically. This stacking structure enables the manufacture of ultra-small chips and reduces the chip manufacturing and mounting processes to one-third, providing irreplaceable competitiveness in the KRW100 trillion display market. The stack-structure WICOP Pixel also reduces the luminous area to one-third, making it possible to boost transparency as high as more than 90%. This makes WICOP Pixel an essential technology for the future metaverse world including AR and VR.\n\u2018WICOP\u2019 technology allows mounting to be performed without a gold wire, which is an essential component in all existing LED manufacturing processes, and Seoul Viosys is the first in the world to develop and mass-produce a product with the technology. It is one of the core second-generation technologies in the LED industry, and neither miniLEDs nor microLEDs can be made without using WICOP technology.\n\u2018WICOP Pixel\u2019 can be called a semiconductor revolution. Lee Chung-hoon, founder of Seoul Semiconductor and Seoul Viosys, invited journalists from across the world to launch a new product at the Grand Ballroom of the InterContinental Hotel in Shanghai, China in September 2015.\nRelated Posts\nMojo Vision Unveils RGB MicroLED Technology Using Proprietary Quantum Dot Integration\nShawnee Blackwood\nSamsung Unveils 2024 QLED Lineup and Transparent MicroLED Display\nShawnee Blackwood\nInnolux Subsidiary Showcasing New Automotive Display Technologies at CES 2024\nJoseph Bryans\nSamsung Display and LG Display Have New Year\u2019s Resolutions Just Like the Rest of Us\nShawnee Blackwood\nJon Peddie Research4 St. Gabrielle Ct.Tiburon, California 94920\n415-435-9368\n\u00a9 2024 Jon Peddie Research\nAbout us | Privacy Policy | terms of service | contact"

This is deemed to be the highest level in the category of one-chip-based displays. Seoul Viosys will showcase its WICOP Pixel solutions at a separate micro-LED booth in the ISE exhibition center.\nWICOP Pixel Based on Innovative Features\nWICOP Pixel refers to the world\u2019s first full-color one-chip technology characterized by no-wire, no-package, no-lens, and vertically stacked three (RGB) micro-LEDs. It is clearly differentiated from existing micro-LED technologies because three LEDs combine and emit light of different colors like one pixel. Colors combined in the pixel are expressed externally and therefore are not distorted regardless of the direction (up, down, right, and left) from which displays are watched.\nStacking characterizing WICOP Pixel makes it possible to manufacture microchips, reducing the number of display production processes to one-third. This also makes it easier to enhance yields and cut manufacturing costs. Its emission area also shrinks to one-third of that for existing flat products, enabling the sphere of business to expand to include AR, VR, and metaverse.\nMicro-LED Technology Optimized for Signage, Virtual Production (VP), and Automotive Exterior Displays\nWICOP Pixel featuring a brightness of 4,000 nits is micro-LED technology optimized for signage, VP, and automotive exterior displays.\nAt present, general LED packages or mini-LEDs, rather than micro-LEDs, are used for outdoor displays. Outdoor displays require a brightness of 3,000 nits or higher but existing micro-LEDs have been limited to a brightness of 1,000 to 2,000 nits. However, WICOP Pixel enables a brightness of 4,000 nits, expressing consistent colors regardless of direction. Seoul Viosys started mass-producing micro-LED signage in the first half of 2020, planning to manufacture new products for VP in large quantities in the first quarter of this year.\n\u201cSeoul Viosys has already secured technologies for mass-producing new products for micro-displays including wearable, VR, and AR devices, as well as significantly improving the functions of WICOP Pixel. This ISE will serve as an opportunity to find and secure new clients and business partners. To this end, we will actively conduct marketing activities, focusing on the continuous development and sophistication of micro-LED technologies,\u201d said Seoul Viosys CEO and President Lee Young-joo.\nSeoul Viosys is the only component manufacturer to win the display innovation award at CES 2023 for its WICOP Pixel, a sophisticated one-chip micro-LED display technology that does not require wire bonding and packaging.\nIf you would like to know more details , please contact:"

The draft ISO standard on determining solar irradiances(ISO-DIS-21348) describes the UVA(400~315nm), NUV(400~300nm), UVB(315~280nm), MUV(300~200nm) , UVC(280~100nm).\nThe benefits of UV LED are many, compared with mercury contained lamp.\nLED pulls significantly less energy and in most cases can be plugged into standard wall outlet. In addition, the LED is instant on/off; there is no need to keep the lamps running when not in use. Mercury lamps also emit ozone that needs to be removed. It can lead to respiratory problem for those who work near the UV Lamp units, so it\u2019s important to make sure the UV lamp units are well vented to evacuate ozone from the work area. The cost of displacing large amount of air contributes to higher energy consumption and higher overhead cost. LED does not emit ozone.\nMercury UV Lamp\u2019s usable life is about 2,000 hours. LED have a life in excess of ten years running continuously, with instant on/off and 8 hours of use per day.Small form factor of UV LED is also a strong point. UV LED is much smaller in size than conventional UV lamp, so it gives more flexibilities for designing the UV applications.\nThe UV LED does not use mercury and thus is environment-friendly and has advantages of long lifespan, saving of energy and low heat loss etc.\nSeoul Viosys is the only LED manufacturer which has capacity of development and production of UV products with every wavelength (225nm~405nm).\nThe Yole development company is foreseeing in its recent report that the UV LED has started to replace the application products where the mercury lamps are used thanks to the compact size, low maintenance cost and environment-friendliness, the replacement with UV LED will continue and it will pioneer new product market such as portable products. It is foreseen that the UV LED market will grow by 30 million dollars each year starting at 32.5 million dollars in 2011 and reaching at 150 million dollar in 2016 and the occupancy rate in the existing UV lamp market will rise by 17.7% from 10.4% in 2011 to 28.1%.\nMost of the UV Led sold were UVA/B(365-400mm) wavelength range of products, and more than 90% of the products were light firearms, forgery testing machine, medical field and equipment appurtenant products. But, starting from this year, the water/air sterilization/purification system using UV LED of UVC wavelength range will be commercialized. Also, visible ray LED corporations from Japan, Taiwan and China will enter the UV LED device market and thus the competition will be fierce.\nThe LED of UV scope is seeing high efficiency and high output and the industrial use is being proliferated. The UV LED has different application family according to the luminous wavelength and the UV A scope(315-400mm) is mainly used for light firearms, forgery testing machine etc, the UV B scope(280-315mm) is used in medical equipment, analyzing machine and vitamin synthesis etc for medical/bio fields and the UV C scope(280-200mm) is used mainly in the environment field like the sterilization/purification/filtration of water etc.\nHowever, although there are many applications and potential markets like this, the current UV LED light source have difficulties in entering the market due to the difficulties in high quality thin film growth due to the use of AIN family material and the low light output of the UV LED element due to the non-development of element production process technology and absence of the UV LED package element. The market will be magnified with the technological overcoming about the above problems.\nFamily Sites\nFollow Us\nReport a Concern"
