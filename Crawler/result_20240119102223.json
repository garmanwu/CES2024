The new technologies and strategic partnerships will debut alongside XGIMI's new 2024 projectors, starting with the IMAX Enhanced certified HORIZON Max at CES 2024. Also being showcased at CES 2024 is Aladdin, the soon-to-be-released 3-in-1 smart projector lamp and speaker, which has been selected as a 2024 CES Innovation Award honoree and is XGIMI's first smart home-connected product. CES 2024 attendees can go hands-on with HORIZON Max, Aladdin, and other incredible XGIMI technologies, at LVCC, Central Hall - 22515.\nExperience IMAX's Signature Picture with DTS Audio from the Comfort of Home\nExpected to launch in late 2024, HORIZON Max is the world's first Long Throw smart projector that is IMAX Enhanced certified, bringing IMAX's picture and signature sound, via DTS:X, to the home. The groundbreaking IMAX Enhanced certification, previously exclusive to premium-priced projectors, underscores XGIMI's commitment to providing inclusive premium-grade entertainment. \"With the HORIZON Max, we're reshaping home entertainment, delivering a cinematic experience previously reserved for high-end projectors,\" Apollo Zhong, CEO and founder of XGIMI, stated. \"With the HORIZON Ultra, we brought Dolby Vision to 4K long-throw home projectors for the first time. Now, HORIZON Max boasts both IMAX Enhanced certification and Dolby Vision for picture/image performance. XGIMI remains steadfast in its commitment to enhancing projection technology, striving to bring the theatrical movie experience into every home. HORIZON Max not only establishes a new benchmark for the industry with this certification but also represents a significant milestone for the brand by introducing the most refined versions of its signature ISA and Dual Light technologies. In 2024, we are excited to expand our line-up with more cutting-edge projectors featuring IMAX Enhanced certification and Dolby Vision, reinforcing our commitment to delivering unparalleled visual experiences in partnership with industry leaders.\"\nA Projector on Autopilot\nXGIMI's new, revolutionary ISA 5.0 (Intelligent Screen Adaptation) technology uses hardware and software enhancements to introduce a paradigm shift in smart projector engineering. Through its exclusive, fully automated motorized gimbal, HORIZON Max goes beyond traditional projection systems by automatically locating the best projection positioning on the wall, and intelligently remembering settings for specific walls, offering users unparalleled convenience. Users can use the HORIZON Max for gaming on one side of the room and enjoying movies on the other, and the projector will seamlessly transition when moved between walls, automatically adapting its software and hardware settings to optimize the experience for each activity. This new feature offers users more control and flexibility over the projected image and content. Integrating 3D ToF in ISA 5.0 enhances HORIZON Max's ability to swiftly detect the surrounding space, enabling users to find the optimal projection spot effortlessly. This alleviates the usual hassles associated with traditional projectors, offering the most seamless and user-friendly experience.\nRemarkable Picture Quality\nHORIZON Max also achieves extraordinary picture quality through its updated Dual Light 2.0 technology - XGIMI's brand-new, exclusive system with a dual-light light source. It integrates a Triple laser for an extended color range and a phosphor light to enhance any imperfections produced by the Triple laser. The proprietary optical engine is equipped with MCL lasers commonly used in commercial theaters, leading the way in triple laser performance. As a result of the upgrade to Dual Light 2.0, the viewing experience provided by the HORIZON Max is cinematic and comfortable, boasting an ultra-wide color gamut, ultra-high brightness (3,100 ISO Lumens), ultra-high contrast (2000:1 native contrast ratio) and ultra-high color accuracy. The new system delivers XGIMI's brightest display to date, a 35% increase from the HORIZON Ultra. The HORIZON Max, boasting IMAX Enhanced Certification and Dolby Vision, sets a new standard in home entertainment, surpassing peers in its price range. XGIMI will bring its updated Dual Light 2.0 and ISA 5.0 technologies to more of XGIMI's lineup in 2024, including portable and home projectors.\nOne Projector, Three Breakthrough Devices\nAt CES, XGIMI will also unveil Aladdin, a revolutionary product that seamlessly blends a smart ceiling lamp, high-end projector, and connected speakers, to optimize your living space.

Learn more\nThis XGIMI projector has IMAX technology built in \u2014 and we got to try it\nCNN Underscored hit the ground at CES 2024 in Las Vegas to pick out the tech products that are actually worth your attention. Be sure to follow our\u00a0CES 2024 coverage hub\u00a0for\nall of our hands-on previews straight from the world\u2019s biggest electronics show\nXGIMI has impressed us over the years with their high-end projectors that can turn any room in your home into a movie theater. At CES 2024, they\u2019re doing that yet again with the introduction of the Horizon Max, one of the only projectors you\u2019ll find that uses IMAX technology to enhance its picture quality.\nThat sounds like a major deal, and it is. XGIMI says this is the first long-throw smart projector that comes with IMAX Enhanced certification, a spec that previously remained exclusive to more costly projectors. The new device is also making a handful of improvements over last year\u2019s Horizon Ultra, including a fancy new stand that lets the projector automatically spin around the room to find the right angle.\nWe were given a sneak peek of the Horizon Ultra at CES, and it left us very excited to test drive it in our own home.\nPricing and availability\nXGIMI says the Horizon Max will launch by the end of the year. I asked some of the executives if it would be ready by the holidays, and they indicated that it would be. They also said the price would be less than $3,000, but that could obviously change before it launches.\nBringing the best of the movies to your home\nThe big draw to this projector is its IMAX Enhanced certification. Not only is it incredibly cool to have similar technology to your favorite movie theater but it\u2019s extremely rare to find in the home projector market.\nThe certification brings the Horizon Max\u2019s picture quality up to IMAX\u2019s standards for optimal picture and image quality. It also means this projector is perfect for streaming IMAX Enhanced titles from services like Disney+. XGIMI says it wanted first to achieve Dolby Vision certification, which it did successfully with the Horizon Ultra last year. Now, it\u2019ll focus on bringing IMAX to more of its products.\nA swiveling design with souped-up specs\nBeing an IMAX projector, it\u2019s only appropriate for the Horizon Max to look the part. XGIMI gave the projector quite the aesthetic, with a dark-gray body and wooden cover for the speakers. It feels a bit retro, which is a lot of fun. The lens system is located behind a piece of glass at the top, and the whole thing is propped up by a stand that has a few neat tricks up its sleeve.\nFor one, the stand lets the projector automatically adjust its throw angle up or down to accommodate for the wall it\u2019s projecting on. We saw a demo of that in action at XGIMI\u2019s booth at CES, and it seemed to work well. It was able to avoid obstructions with ease and position the projection in an ideal spot for viewing.\nThere\u2019s also a motorized, 360-degree plate on the bottom of the stand that lets the Horizon Max swivel automatically to adjust the angle accordingly. Combined with its ability to move up and down automatically, there was a lot going on when the Horizon Max saw a wall in front of it and decided to start adjusting things. In the end, it was able to locate a great spot for projecting.\nThese features work in conjunction with automatic keystone correction, autofocus, XGIMI\u2019s Intelligent Obstacle Avoidance and color tone adjustments for getting the right picture quality on your wall without having to manually adjust anything.\nThere\u2019s also a new feature called Intelligent Screen Adaption 5.0, or ISA 5.0, that uses new hardware and software enhancements to read the surface the projector is looking at and make adjustments accordingly. It uses a unique, fully automated motorized gimbal and a 3D time-of-flight system (similar to the one in Face ID on the iPhone) to map out the angle and depth of the surface and automatically make adjustments for the perfect positioning. Plus, it can remember each surface you shine it on, so the adjustments are automatically applied when you fire it up later.\nThere\u2019s also Dual Light 2.0, XGIMI\u2019s new dual-light light source that integrates a triple laser, a phosphor light and MCL lasers to achieve a broader range of colors and boost the brightness of the projection significantly. According to the company, this thing has an \u201cultrawide\u201d color gamut, 3,100 ISO lumens of brightness (which is 35% more than the already impressive Horizon Ultra), a 2000:1 native contrast ratio and improved color accuracy. Together, these specs help the Horizon Max earn its IMAX Enhanced certification, which will help all the content you play from it look better than any XGIMI projector before.\nXGIMI says ISA 5.0 and Dual Light 2.0 will both ship on more projectors later this year, after first appearing on the Horizon Max.\nA couple of final notes on the specs:\n\u2022 The Horizon Max can stretch its projection up to 200 inches. We saw a demo with IMAX content at 180 inches and everything looked sharp, bright, and colorful, so I imagine that experience will carry over to 200 inches.\u2022 There are two 12W Harman Kardon speakers inside the Horizon Max, but we weren\u2019t able to test drive them during our booth tour.\u2022 It comes with two HDMI 2.1 ports, so you can enjoy the benefits of the latest HDMI spec, like better bandwidth for 4K content.\u2022 You\u2019ll have plenty of room to store apps, games and more, thank with to the inclusion of 128GB of storage.\nIt\u2019s still easy to use\nXGIMI maintains an easy-to-use experience with the Horizon Max, thanks to the inclusion of Android TV or Google TV. (At the time of writing, the company hasn\u2019t decided which version of the OS will make it onto production models.) It\u2019ll also come with a custom remote for controlling everything, and the setup process will be similar to the Horizon Ultra, which was abundantly simple to walk through.\nBottom line\nThe Horizon Max left us impressed with what XGIMI is capable of. There\u2019s nothing quite like this on the market, especially not in the home projector space. I\u2019ll be curious to see how well all its flashy new features work in the real world when I get my hands on a review sample, so stay tuned.\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Xgimi's Projector Promises an IMAX Experience in Your Living Room\nXgimi's Horizon Max also features a built-in gimbal that aims to simplify setup by scanning your walls and finding the best position to project video.\nIf you want a giant screen that doesn't permanently cover an entire wall, a projector is the way to go. Xgimi's latest projectors take that concept to a new level between the Horizon Max, which can switch projection walls on the fly, and the Aladdin, which blends seamlessly into your room by doubling as a ceiling light.\nXgimi says the Horizon Max is the first IMAX Enhanced long throw projector. A true IMAX theater in your home would cost millions; however, the IMAX Enhanced certification process aims to lower that cost. These projectors meet specific requirements for resolution, color, brightness, contrast, and sound. With IMAX Enhanced Certification, the Horizon Max projector will automatically detect IMAX Enhanced content, such as some Marvel movies on Disney+, and scale up to IMAX'S 1.9:1 aspect ratio.\nThe Horizon Max also features a built-in gimbal that promises to simplify setup by scanning your walls and finding the best position to project video. It can remember those settings and even switch to a different wall as needed. You could use one wall for watching movies and another to play games, for example. Horizon will handle all the moving for you.\nThe projector is capable of 4K resolution (though Xgimi didn't clarify if that's native or upscaled) and uses a dual-light triple laser system to achieve greater brightness and wider color. We don't have exact specs, though, so we'll need to go eyes on to say more.\nThe company also announced a second projector, the Aladdin. It doubles as a ceiling lamp and speaker system, which should allow for easy install while avoiding some of the usual pitfalls of projectors. Just replace your ceiling lamp with the Aladdin, and you won't have to worry about people standing in front of your projector anymore.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nFor now, the company only plans to release the Aladdin in Japan. Xgimi didn't say precisely when the Horizon Max will launch, just that it will arrive in 2024.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

These will debut alongside the company\u2019s new 2024 projectors, including the IMAX Enhanced certified HORIZON Max. Also being showcased at CES is Aladdin, the soon-to-be-released 3-in-1 smart projector lamp and speaker, which has been selected as a CES Innovation Award honoree and is XGIMI\u2019s first smart home-connected product. Attendees can go hands-on with HORIZON Max, Aladdin, and other XGIMI technologies at LVCC, Central Hall \u2013 22515.\nExperience IMAX\u2019s Signature Picture with DTS Audio from the Comfort of Home\nExpected to launch in late 2024, HORIZON Max is the world\u2019s first Long Throw smart projector that is IMAX Enhanced certified, bringing IMAX\u2019s picture and signature sound, via DTS:X, to the home. The groundbreaking IMAX Enhanced certification, previously exclusive to premium-priced projectors, underscores XGIMI\u2019s commitment to providing inclusive premium-grade entertainment.\u00a0\u201cWith the HORIZON Max, we\u2019re reshaping home entertainment, delivering a cinematic experience previously reserved for high-end projectors,\u201d\u00a0Apollo Zhong, CEO and founder of XGIMI, stated. \u201cWith the HORIZON Ultra, we brought Dolby Vision to\u00a04K\u00a0long-throw home projectors for the first time. Now, HORIZON Max boasts both IMAX Enhanced certification and Dolby Vision for picture/image performance. XGIMI remains steadfast in its commitment to enhancing projection technology, striving to bring the theatrical movie experience into every home. HORIZON Max not only establishes a new benchmark for the industry with this certification but also represents a significant milestone for the brand by introducing the most refined versions of its signature ISA and Dual Light technologies. In 2024, we are excited to expand our line-up with more cutting-edge projectors featuring IMAX Enhanced certification and Dolby Vision, reinforcing our commitment to delivering unparalleled visual experiences in partnership with industry leaders.\u201d\nA Projector on Autopilot\nXGIMI\u2019s new ISA 5.0 (Intelligent Screen Adaptation) technology uses hardware and software enhancements to introduce a paradigm shift in smart projector engineering. Through its exclusive, fully automated motorized gimbal, HORIZON Max goes beyond traditional projection systems by automatically locating the best projection positioning on the wall, and intelligently remembering settings for specific walls, offering users unparalleled convenience. Users can use the HORIZON Max for gaming on one side of the room and enjoying movies on the other, and the projector will seamlessly transition when moved between walls, automatically adapting its software and hardware settings to optimize the experience for each activity. This new feature offers users more control and flexibility over the projected image and content. Integrating 3D ToF in ISA 5.0 enhances HORIZON Max\u2019s ability to swiftly detect the surrounding space, enabling users to find the optimal projection spot effortlessly. This alleviates the usual hassles associated with traditional projectors, offering the most seamless and user-friendly experience.\nRemarkable Picture Quality\nHORIZON Max also features updated Dual Light 2.0 technology \u2013 XGIMI\u2019s brand-new, exclusive system with a dual-light light source. It integrates a Triple laser for an extended color range and a phosphor light to enhance any imperfections produced by the Triple laser. The proprietary optical engine is equipped with MCL lasers commonly used in commercial theaters, leading the way in triple laser performance. As a result of the upgrade to Dual Light 2.0, the viewing experience provided by the HORIZON Max is cinematic and comfortable, boasting an ultra-wide color gamut, ultra-high brightness (3,100 ISO Lumens), ultra-high contrast (2000:1 native contrast ratio) and ultra-high color accuracy. The new system delivers XGIMI\u2019s brightest display to date, a 35% increase from the HORIZON Ultra. The HORIZON Max, boasting IMAX Enhanced Certification and Dolby Vision, sets a new standard in home entertainment, surpassing peers in its price range. XGIMI will bring its updated Dual Light 2.0 and ISA 5.0 technologies to more of XGIMI\u2019s lineup in 2024, including portable and home projectors.\nOne Projector, Three Breakthrough Devices\nAt CES, XGIMI will also unveil Aladdin, a product that seamlessly blends a smart ceiling lamp, high-end projector, and connected speakers, to optimize your living space. By delivering a cinematic experience of up to 100 inches directly from the ceiling, Aladdin solves the issues of traditional projectors, eliminating concerns like bulkiness, screen blockage, and glare, providing an immersive viewing experience without compromising floor space. Its strategic positioning prevents direct light exposure, prioritizing user safety, and allows an impressive 0.7:1 projection ratio, effortlessly transforming any space into a media haven. Aladdin is set to launch in Japan\u00a0in\u00a0June 2024.\n\u201cAladdin is a truly unique triple-threat that represents the harmonious fusion of cutting-edge projector technology and sophisticated smart home design,\u201d continued Zhong. \u201cWe are deeply honored to receive a prestigious CES Innovation Honoree Award, underscoring the groundbreaking technological advancements we\u2019ve pioneered with Aladdin. Its seamless integration of an HD projector, smart light, and premium audio experience, encapsulates our mission of delivering unparalleled home entertainment experiences to the masses. We look forward to building on this success and driving further Smart Home innovation in 2024 and beyond.\u201d\nIntelligent Design for an Effortless Integration\nAladdin\u2019s modern design offers the same hassle-free installation as a standard ceiling light but provides users with a feature-rich projector, and a 360-degree\u00a0Harman Kardon\u00a0smart speaker. This eliminates the need for extensive in-ceiling installs and allows Aladdin to effortlessly integrate into existing home decor. Beyond typical projector use cases, Aladdin offers immersive dynamic wallpapers, life-sized interactive children\u2019s books, and soothing ambient sounds for bedtime, bringing pure magic to the living space. It was selected as a 2024 CES Innovation Award honoree thanks to its exceptional design and its transformative function in the smart home, in addition to XGIMI\u2019s commitment as a brand to push the boundaries of home entertainment technology.\nDedication to Continuous Innovation through Strategic Partnerships\nA key strategic partnership the brand is excited to introduce is with MediaTek. The brand stands as a crucial partner for XGIMI, with the entirety of XGIMI\u2019s premium product line adopting MediaTek\u2019s cutting-edge chips. Together, they\u2019ve spearheaded a revolutionary transformation in the projector space, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of home entertainment.\nLooking ahead to 2024, MediaTek, in collaboration with Google TV and XGIMI, is set to unveil a range of intelligent projection solutions. This strategic alliance aims to propel a more diverse and immersive home entertainment experience, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of smart projection technology and the companies at the forefront of projector innovation.\nAvailability\nXGIMI is showcasing the HORIZON Max, Aladdin, and other exciting innovations in its 2024 product lineup at CES,\u00a0January 9-12, 2024, in Central Hall \u2013 Booth 22515 of the\u00a0Las Vegas\u00a0Convention Center (LVCC).\nTo learn more about the HORIZON Max and other XGIMI products, visit the\u00a0XGIMI Website, or follow @XGIMItech on\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Twitter, and\u00a0LinkedIn.\nSee also: Noveto To Unveil \u2018Immersive Private Sound Bubble\u2019 Soundbars At CES 2024\nTWICE Staff\nFor more stories like this, and to keep up to date with all our market leading news, features and analysis, sign up to our newsletter here.\nTags \u22c5 4K Projector \u22c5 CES \u22c5 CES 2024 \u22c5 Dolby Vision \u22c5 HORIZON Max \u22c5 imax enhanced certified \u22c5 smart projector \u22c5 XGIMI \u22c5 XGIMI Aladdin\nFeatured\nVIDEO: The New Age Electronics Outlook\u2014Part 3\u2014with Steve Koenig\nSupply Shortages And Port Delays Driving Holiday Shoppers To Start Early This Season\nBack-to-School Season Means Gearing Up for More e-Learning and Working From Home\n3 New Nationwide Vendor Partners Available To Boost Home Entertainment Experience\nRelated Articles\nRoboSense To Showcase Next-Gen LiDAR Innovations At CES 2024\nSharp To Showcase Plethora Of New Technologies At CES 2024\nChillBaby Technologies To Introduce AI Camera For Children\u2019s Mealtime At CES\nCall For Editorial Coverage In The Official 2024 CES Daily\nAll-New Honda EV To Debut At CES 2024\nCoway Receives CES 2024 Innovation Award For BEREX Reclining Massage Bed\nITRI To Exhibit Innovations Across Industries At CES 2024\nNew Year, New Tech: CES 2023 Sneak Peeks\nKohler Highlights Smart Home Self-Care At CES\nNOVELDA To Demo New Child Presence Detector (CPD) Sensor At CES 2024\n\u00a9 2024 TWICE is part of Future plc, an international media group and leading digital publisher."

HORIZON Max also offers enhanced picture quality through its updated Dual Light 2.0 technology which integrates a Triple laser for an extended color gamut. The proprietary optical engine is equipped with MCL lasers commonly used in commercial theaters. The HORIZON Max has a brightness of 3,100 ISO Lumens and a contrast ratio of 2000:1.\nAt CES, XGIMI also introduced Aladdin, a product that bundles a smart ceiling lamp, high-end projector, and connected speakers into one. Aladdin\u2019s design offers installation as easy as a standard ceiling light but provides users with a feature-rich projector, and a 360-degree\u00a0Harman Kardon\u00a0smart speaker. Beyond typical projector use cases, Aladdin offers immersive dynamic wallpaper, life-sized interactive children\u2019s books, and soothing ambient sounds.\nPMA Research, the large screen display experts, collect and analyze sell-in and sell-through data for the projector industry, to provide a series of monthly and quarterly market reports.

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\nCES 2024: Xgimi's Projector Promises an IMAX Experience in Your Living Room\nXgimi's Horizon Max also features a built-in gimbal that aims to simplify setup by scanning your walls and finding the best position to project video.\nIf you want a giant screen that doesn't permanently cover an entire wall, a projector is the way to go. Xgimi's latest projectors take that concept to a new level between the Horizon Max, which can switch projection walls on the fly, and the Aladdin, which blends seamlessly into your room by doubling as a ceiling light.\nXgimi says the Horizon Max is the first IMAX Enhanced long throw projector. A true IMAX theater in your home would cost millions; however, the IMAX Enhanced certification process aims to lower that cost. These projectors meet specific requirements for resolution, color, brightness, contrast, and sound. With IMAX Enhanced Certification, the Horizon Max projector will automatically detect IMAX Enhanced content, such as some Marvel movies on Disney+, and scale up to IMAX'S 1.9:1 aspect ratio.\nThe Horizon Max also features a built-in gimbal that promises to simplify setup by scanning your walls and finding the best position to project video. It can remember those settings and even switch to a different wall as needed. You could use one wall for watching movies and another to play games, for example. Horizon will handle all the moving for you.\nThe projector is capable of 4K resolution (though Xgimi didn't clarify if that's native or upscaled) and uses a dual-light triple laser system to achieve greater brightness and wider color. We don't have exact specs, though, so we'll need to go eyes on to say more.\nThe company also announced a second projector, the Aladdin. It doubles as a ceiling lamp and speaker system, which should allow for easy install while avoiding some of the usual pitfalls of projectors. Just replace your ceiling lamp with the Aladdin, and you won't have to worry about people standing in front of your projector anymore.\nFor now, the company only plans to release the Aladdin in Japan. Xgimi didn't say precisely when the Horizon Max will launch, just that it will arrive in 2024.\nAbout Josh Hendrickson\nFrom nearly the moment he could spell \u201ccomputer,\u201d Josh Hendrickson has been fascinated by Windows, PCs, and the electronics that have become an integral part of life.

If the HORIZON Max is half as good as the HORIZON Ultra, then we can expect some great things from this new projector. The Aladdin smart projector is a new device, but looks rather interesting. Here\u2019s what the press release had to say about both the HORIZON Max and Aladdin.\nEstimated reading time: 3 minutes\nExpected to launch in late 2024, HORIZON Max is the world\u2019s first Long Throw smart projector that is IMAX Enhanced certified, bringing IMAX\u2019s picture and signature sound to the home. The groundbreaking IMAX Enhanced certification, previously exclusive to premium-priced projectors, underscores XGIMI\u2019s commitment to providing inclusive premium-grade entertainment.\nPlease enable JavaScript\n\u201cWith the HORIZON Max, we\u2019re reshaping home entertainment, delivering a cinematic experience previously reserved for high-end projectors,\u201d Apollo Zhong, CEO and founder of XGIMI, stated. \u201cHORIZON Ultra achieved Dolby Vision, and now, HORIZON Max boasts IMAX Enhanced certification for picture/image performance. XGIMI remains steadfast in its commitment to enhancing projection technology, striving to bring the theatrical movie experience into every home. HORIZON Max not only establishes a new benchmark for the industry with this certification but also represents a significant milestone for the brand by introducing the most refined versions of its signature ISA and Dual Light technologies.\u201d\nHORIZON Max\nXGIMI\u2019s new, revolutionary ISA 5.0 (Intelligent Screen Adaptation) technology uses hardware and software enhancements to introduce a paradigm shift in smart projector engineering. Through its exclusive, fully automated motorized gimbal, HORIZON Max goes beyond traditional projection systems by automatically locating the best projection positioning on the wall, and intelligently remembering settings for specific walls, offering users unparalleled convenience.\nUsers can use the HORIZON Max for gaming on one side of the room and enjoying movies on the other, and the projector will seamlessly transition when moved between walls, automatically adapting its software and hardware settings to optimize the experience for each activity. This new feature offers users more control and flexibility over the projected image and content. Integrating 3D ToF in ISA 5.0 enhances HORIZON Max\u2019s ability to swiftly detect the surrounding space, enabling users to find the optimal projection spot effortlessly. This alleviates the usual hassles associated with traditional projectors, offering the most seamless and user-friendly experience.\nPicture Quality\nHORIZON Max also achieves extraordinary picture quality through its updated Dual Light 2.0 technology \u2013 XGIMI\u2019s brand-new, exclusive system with a dual-light light source. It integrates a Triple laser for an extended color range and a phosphor light to enhance any imperfections produced by the Triple laser. The proprietary optical engine is equipped with MCL lasers commonly used in commercial theaters, leading the way in triple laser performance.\nAs a result of the upgrade to Dual Light 2.0, the viewing experience provided by the HORIZON Max is cinematic and comfortable, boasting an ultra-wide color gamut, ultra-high brightness (3,100 ISO Lumens), ultra-high contrast (2000:1 native contrast ratio) and ultra-high color accuracy. The new system delivers XGIMI\u2019s brightest display to date, a 35% increase from the HORIZON Ultra. These innovations earn HORIZON Max IMAX Enhanced Certification, surpassing conventional projectors in the same (and much higher) price range and setting a new standard for home entertainment.\nXGIMI will bring its updated Dual Light 2.0 and ISA 5.0 technologies to more of XGIMI\u2019s lineup in 2024, including portable and home projectors.\nAladdin\nAladdin, a revolutionary product that seamlessly blends a smart ceiling lamp, high-end projector, and connected speakers, to optimize your living space. By delivering a cinematic experience of up to 100 inches (ca. 254 cm) directly from the ceiling, Aladdin solves the issues of traditional projectors, eliminating concerns like bulkiness, screen blockage, and glare, providing an immersive viewing experience without compromising floor space. Its strategic positioning prevents direct light exposure, prioritizing user safety, and allows an impressive 0.7:1 projection ratio, effortlessly transforming any space into a media haven. Aladdin is set to launch in Japan in June 2024.\n\u201cAladdin is a truly unique triple-threat that represents the harmonious fusion of cutting-edge projector technology and sophisticated smart home design,\u201d continued Zhong. \u201cWe are deeply honored to receive a prestigious CES Innovation Honoree Award, underscoring the groundbreaking technological advancements we\u2019ve pioneered with Aladdin. Its seamless integration of an HD projector, smart light, and premium audio experience, encapsulates our mission of delivering unparalleled home entertainment experiences to the masses. We look forward to building on this success and driving further Smart Home innovation in 2024 and beyond.\u201d\nDesign and Innovation\nThe Aladdin modern design offers the same hassle-free installation as a standard ceiling light but provides users with a feature-rich projector, and a 360-degree Harman Kardon smart speaker. This eliminates the need for extensive in-ceiling installs and allows Aladdin to effortlessly integrate into existing home decor.\nBeyond typical projector use cases, Aladdin offers immersive dynamic wallpapers, life-sized interactive children\u2019s books, and soothing ambient sounds for bedtime, bringing pure magic to the living space. It was selected as a 2024 CES Innovation Award honoree thanks to its exceptional design and its transformative function in the smart home, in addition to XGIMI\u2019s commitment as a brand to push the boundaries of home entertainment technology.\nA key strategic partnership the brand is excited to introduce is with MediaTek.

        "raw_content": "Xgimi\u2019s new IMAX Enhanced and ceiling lamp projectors made me see the light\nChinese projector maker Xgimi makes some pretty great portable and premium projectors\u00a0and\u00a0somehow does it without charging a fortune for them. At CES 2024, the company showed off two new upcoming projectors: the IMAX Enhanced certified Horizon Max, the company\u2019s brightest projector to date that features a neat precision gimbal system for auto keystoning and some smart screen adaptation tech, and the unique Aladdin, a 3-in-one smart home ceiling lamp, speaker, and projector.\u00a0I checked it all out at the company\u2019s busy CES 2024 booth.\nXgimi Horizon Max\nBuilding off of the success of last year\u2019s Horizon Ultra 4K projector that boasted support for Dolby Vision, Xgimi (pronounced \u201cex-jeemee\u201d) hopes to strike gold again with the Horizon Max. Xgimi says the Horizon Max is the \u201cWorld\u2019s first long-throw projector to feature the IMAX Enhanced certification.\u201d\nSo, what does that mean, exactly? \u00a0Well, it can be applied to streaming services (Disney+, for example, has several of its movies viewable in IMAX Enhanced formats, and the Horizon Max can play them), and devices such as TVs, AV receivers, speakers, and, in this case, projectors. In a partnership between IMAX and multi-channel audio company DTS, the IMAX Enhanced team gets together with some technical folks from Hollywood to determine if the devices live up to its standards for resolution, color, contrast, and brightness, as well as DTS:X\u2019s immersive sound. The Horizon Max does.\nWhen I reviewed the Horizon Ultra projector last year, I was impressed with its quick and easy auto keystone and alignment features and configurable picture settings, and the Max takes this to a whole new level.\nWith something Xgimi calls ISA 5.0 (intelligent screen adaptation), Horizon Max uses a motorized gimbal system driven by automated software. Using 3D ToF (time of flight) detection, the projector scans the space, adjusts to the room and the wall or screen you\u2019re using, and configures the settings accordingly.\nThe CES demo was impressive. In a three-walled demo room with obstacles on the walls (such as a framed picture), the bottom gimbal turned the projector horizontally while the side stand-attached gimbal moved the projector vertically as the image floated its way across the wall. Upon hitting the framed picture (where the 3D ToF comes in), the image just continued to the next wall where it settled on a clear, optimal viewing space \u2014 all the while automatically adjusting keystone as it moved, nearly instantaneously.\nBut beyond that, the projector will also adjust its settings, optimizing them for specific activities and surfaces and remembering them. This could come in handy if you, say, watched all your movies and shows in one room or screen but wanted to move the projector to another room or screen for gaming.\nBut how does it look? While we\u2019ll have to wait until later this year to get our hands on the 4K projector for a proper review, after a look at the Horizon Max at the company\u2019s booth at CES 2024, I can report that the 180-inch image I witnessed in its demo room on the show floor was beautifully bright and color accurate (if I know my Marvel movies, and I do), with rich blacks and contrast.\nXgimi has achieved this with some new exclusive light technology it has developed, namely Dual Light 2.0. This is the second iteration of the tech that we saw in the Horizon Ultra, but this time, it combines triple MCL lasers typically found in commercial theater projectors that handle color reproduction and contrast, while a phosphor light source is meant to deal with any imperfections caused by the lasers, Xgimi says. The result is a 35% increase in brightness from the Horizon Ultra (3,100 ISO lumens), a contrast ratio of 2000:1, and a wide color gamut (although Xgimi hasn\u2019t released specs on that yet).\nDesign-wise, the Max takes a few notes from the Ultra (it\u2019s also slightly bigger and taller), with a slick bamboo-blind-like face that, like the Ultra, smoothly slides in and out of place to protect and expose the lamp. It\u2019s also propped up a bit on a new gimbal swivel stand, making it easier to point and adjust your image, which you can do with the remote (ceiling mounters rejoice!).\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is slated for a late 2024 release, and Xgimi says that we will see its new Dual Light 2.0 and ISA 5.0 tech make its way into its entire range of projectors this year. No pricing information or additional details have been announced for the Horizon Max yet, but it said it would cost under $3,000, and Xgimi told me that it\u2019s yet to be determined if it will run Android TV or Google TV.\n\u201cWith the Horizon Max, we\u2019re reshaping home entertainment, delivering a cinematic experience previously reserved for high-end projectors,\u201d Apollo Zhong, CEO and founder of XGIMI, said in a press release. \u201cHorizon Ultra achieved Dolby Vision, and now, Horizon Max boasts IMAX Enhanced certification for picture/image performance.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a lamp, it\u2019s a projector, it\u2019s Aladdin\nAnd now for something a little different. CES, if anything, is a great place for companies to show off their more unique new gear, and the Xgimi Aladdin certainly fits in that category.\nThe company calls Aladdin \u201ca revolutionary product that seamlessly blends a smart ceiling lamp, high-end projector, and connected speakers to optimize your living space.\u201d We\u2019ll see about the revolutionary part, but the rest is true.\nBased on the Popin Aladdin 2 Plus design that Xgimi acquired when it bought Popin\u2019s home theater business in 2022, Xgimi\u2019s Aladdin is still in development, with a Japan release in the works for this summer.\nFrom the demo I got at CES, Aladdin does indeed solve many of the issues projector owners can run into, such as placement challenges, screen blockages from people having to walk in front of the light source while watching a movie, and often awkward and unsightly ceiling mounts with cables everywhere (more on that in a bit).\nFew projector specs were announced with the Aladdin ahead of CES, other than it being an \u201cHD\u201d projector with a projection ratio of 0.7:1, which means you can mount it approximately 6 feet from the screen for a 100-inch image. The Popin Aladdin 2 Plus featured 900 ANSI lumens of brightness, so we\u2019ll see if Xgimi\u2019s version matches that. In-line with other Xgimi projectors, the Aladdin features Harman Kardon 360-degree sound that can double as a smart speaker for the room when not being used to binge episodes of something on Netflix. It\u2019s also Wi-Fi-capable and features Bluetooth.\nThe image is what you\u2019d expect from an HD projector, but the room was also a bit bright. That, and we didn\u2019t really look at any movie or TV shows for reference, but the kids games and other content we checked out looked consistent with other HD projectors I\u2019ve seen. The sound from the Harman Kardon speaker was louder and fuller than what I heard in the Horizon Ultra, which I didn\u2019t love, so that\u2019s a good thing.\nAs far as the Aladdin being a smart ceiling lamp, Xgimi said that when it comes to North America, it will likely be installed like a ceiling fan. The built-in speakers also negate the need for running any in-ceiling wires for sound. Pretty clever.\nThe Aladdin\u2019s light was beautifully bright, and its temperature can be adjusted with the remote or an app.\nAnd one more thing\u2026\nRegarding what else Xgimi has in store for 2024, the Chinese company announced that it will be using new chips from Taiwan\u2019s MediaTek in all of its premium projectors. Additionally, Xgimi has partnered with Google TV and plans to launch a range of new products throughout the year that we can assume will be backed by the Google smart TV operating system, which would be a switch from their current allegiance to Android TV.\nNote:\u00a0This post was updated to correct an error that stated that IMAX and DTS are owned by parent company Xperi.\nSamsung isn\u2019t attending IFA 2020, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the tech giant from trying to steal the show anyways.\nAt its virtual \u201cLife Unstoppable\u201d press conference, Samsung announced The Premiere, a 4K projector with an ultra short-throw design and laser technology -- the company calls it the \u201cnew anchor product\u201d in Samsung\u2019s Lifestyle product portfolio, which also includes The Frame, The Sero, and The Terrace.\nThis story is part of our continuing coverage of CES 2020, including tech and gadgets from the showroom floor.\nFor the most part, the U.S. is the land of milk and honey when it comes to the latest tech. It's a huge market, which means tons of choice and some of the lowest prices of any country. But sometimes great products don't hit these shores. Like Philips' excellent OLED TVs, which we had the chance to check out at IFA 2019. However, if recent reports emerging from CES 2020 are accurate, that's about to change: Funai, the company that licenses the Philips brand in the U.S., is going to bring the 804 Series OLED TV to this country in 2020.\nLG did most of its announcing before CES 2020 even kicked off, revealing eight new 8K TVs -- branded the first 'real' 8K TVs to hit the market -- and a roll-down OLED 4K TV. But that's not to say it didn't save something for the trade show: LG introduced the art-inspired GX Gallery Series 4K TV (think: Samsung's Frame TV) and a never-seen-before 48-inch OLED 4K TV.\nSeeing as we covered the 8K TVs and roll-down OLED 4K TV when LG first announced them ahead of CES 2020 last week, we won't run through them again. (If you missed them, you can find links to them scattered throughout this article.) Instead, we'll focus on the hardware we didn't know was in the works, starting with the familiar-looking GX Gallery Series 4K TVs.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

Here\u2019s how it works.\nXgimi unveils the world's first IMAX Enhanced long throw projector at CES\nAnother ambitious world-first projector from Xgimi\nWe certainly can't knock Xgimi's ambitions, as it made headlines with a \"world first\" projector released in 2023. Just six months ago we were taking a look at the Horizon Ultra, which was the world's first Dolby Vision-compatible long throw projector; and we assumed that's about as far as the company would take its Horizon series. Well, the brand's latest reveal at CES has proven us wrong, as the Ultra has been surpassed by a new model.\nIntroducing the Horizon Max, which Xgimi is claiming to be the world's first IMAX Enhanced long throw projector. It shares a lot of DNA with its Ultra sibling, including a similar boxy design and Dual Light source which combines laser and LED. In fact, the Max uses the updated 2.0 edition of the Dual Light system, which Xgimi claims will result in an ultra-wide colour gamut and ultra-high brightness, with Xgimi stating an impressive 3100 ISO Lumens (or roughly 3875 ANSI Lumens). That means the Max will reportedly be 35 per cent brighter than the Horizon Ultra \u2013 not bad at all.\nUnlike the Horizon Ultra, this projector will not support the Dolby picture and sound formats, instead opting for the DTS-derived IMAX technologies, although Xgimi hasn't made it entirely clear as to whether it will support Dolby Atmos or only DTS. Xgimi highlights that IMAX Enhanced is often reserved for premium projector models, but the Horizon Max will make it more accessible to those working on stricter budgets.\nMuch like the Horizon Ultra, the Max will include a very user-friendly set-up thanks to auto keystone and focus correction features \u2013 in fact, Xgimi is calling this a \"projector on autopilot\". The Intelligent Screen Adaptation 5.0 (or ISA) system will quickly adjust the picture to best suit the screen or, in many users' cases, the wall that you'll be projecting onto. If you are planning on projecting onto a wall then fear not, as this projector will intelligently recognise different surfaces and adapt the picture as necessary, as did the Horizon Ultra. This means you won't need a perfectly flat white wall to project onto, although we assume this projector can't work miracles so we'll have to test his feature out.\nFinally, this projector will have Google TV onboard, which means you'll be able to stream conveniently straight from the projector. This operating system should be familiar to anyone who's used a recent Sony or Philips TV, and we certainly appreciate the 'plug and play' functionality without having to mess about with an external streaming device.\nNot only is Xgimi unveiling the Horizon Max at CES, but it will also give a first look at Aladdin \u2013 an intriguing hybrid device that acts as a projector, speaker and ceiling light. You might remember the company revealing something similar in 2022 with the Xgimi Magic Lamp. Could this be the international version, as that projector was only released in China?\nMORE:\nCheck out the latest CES 2024 news\nAs well as our picks for the best projectors\nAnd the best projector deals\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

The new technologies and strategic partnerships will debut alongside XGIMI's new 2024 projectors, starting with the IMAX Enhanced certified HORIZON Max at CES 2024. Also being showcased at CES 2024 is Aladdin, the soon-to-be-released 3-in-1 smart projector lamp and speaker, which has been selected as a 2024 CES Innovation Award honoree and is XGIMI's first smart home-connected product. CES 2024 attendees can go hands-on with HORIZON Max, Aladdin, and other incredible XGIMI technologies, at LVCC, Central Hall - 22515.\nExperience IMAX's Signature Picture with DTS Audio from the Comfort of HomeExpected to launch in late 2024, HORIZON Max is the world's first Long Throw smart projector that is IMAX Enhanced certified, bringing IMAX's picture and signature sound, via DTS:X, to the home. The groundbreaking IMAX Enhanced certification, previously exclusive to premium-priced projectors, underscores XGIMI's commitment to providing inclusive premium-grade entertainment.\u00a0\"With the HORIZON Max, we're reshaping home entertainment, delivering a cinematic experience previously reserved for high-end projectors,\" Apollo Zhong, CEO and founder of XGIMI, stated. \"With the HORIZON Ultra, we brought Dolby Vision to 4K long-throw home projectors for the first time. Now, HORIZON Max boasts both IMAX Enhanced certification and Dolby Vision for picture/image performance. XGIMI remains steadfast in its commitment to enhancing projection technology, striving to bring the theatrical movie experience into every home. HORIZON Max not only establishes a new benchmark for the industry with this certification but also represents a significant milestone for the brand by introducing the most refined versions of its signature ISA and Dual Light technologies. In 2024, we are excited to expand our line-up with more cutting-edge projectors featuring IMAX Enhanced certification and Dolby Vision, reinforcing our commitment to delivering unparalleled visual experiences in partnership with industry leaders.\"\nA Projector on AutopilotXGIMI's new, revolutionary ISA 5.0 (Intelligent Screen Adaptation) technology uses hardware and software enhancements to introduce a paradigm shift in smart projector engineering. Through its exclusive, fully automated motorized gimbal, HORIZON Max goes beyond traditional projection systems by automatically locating the best projection positioning on the wall, and intelligently remembering settings for specific walls, offering users unparalleled convenience. Users can use the HORIZON Max for gaming on one side of the room and enjoying movies on the other, and the projector will seamlessly transition when moved between walls, automatically adapting its software and hardware settings to optimize the experience for each activity. This new feature offers users more control and flexibility over the projected image and content. Integrating 3D ToF in ISA 5.0 enhances HORIZON Max's ability to swiftly detect the surrounding space, enabling users to find the optimal projection spot effortlessly. This alleviates the usual hassles associated with traditional projectors, offering the most seamless and user-friendly experience.\nRemarkable Picture QualityHORIZON Max also achieves extraordinary picture quality through its updated Dual Light 2.0 technology - XGIMI's brand-new, exclusive system with a dual-light light source. It integrates a Triple laser for an extended color range and a phosphor light to enhance any imperfections produced by the Triple laser. The proprietary optical engine is equipped with MCL lasers commonly used in commercial theaters, leading the way in triple laser performance. As a result of the upgrade to Dual Light 2.0, the viewing experience provided by the HORIZON Max is cinematic and comfortable, boasting an ultra-wide color gamut, ultra-high brightness (3,100 ISO Lumens), ultra-high contrast (2000:1 native contrast ratio) and ultra-high color accuracy. The new system delivers XGIMI's brightest display to date, a 35% increase from the HORIZON Ultra. The HORIZON Max, boasting IMAX Enhanced Certification and Dolby Vision, sets a new standard in home entertainment, surpassing peers in its price range.\u00a0XGIMI will bring its updated Dual Light 2.0 and ISA 5.0 technologies to more of XGIMI's lineup in 2024, including portable and home projectors.\nOne Projector, Three Breakthrough DevicesAt CES, XGIMI will also unveil Aladdin, a revolutionary product that seamlessly blends a smart ceiling lamp, high-end projector, and connected speakers, to optimize your living space. By delivering a cinematic experience of up to 100 inches directly from the ceiling, Aladdin solves the issues of traditional projectors, eliminating concerns like bulkiness, screen blockage, and glare, providing an immersive viewing experience without compromising floor space. Its strategic positioning prevents direct light exposure, prioritizing user safety, and allows an impressive 0.7:1 projection ratio, effortlessly transforming any space into a media haven. Aladdin is set to launch in Japan in June 2024.\n\"Aladdin is a truly unique triple-threat that represents the harmonious fusion of cutting-edge projector technology and sophisticated smart home design,\" continued Zhong. \"We are deeply honored to receive a prestigious CES Innovation Honoree Award, underscoring the groundbreaking technological advancements we've pioneered with Aladdin. Its seamless integration of an HD projector, smart light, and premium audio experience, encapsulates our mission of delivering unparalleled home entertainment experiences to the masses. We look forward to building on this success and driving further Smart Home innovation in 2024 and beyond.\"\nIntelligent Design for an Effortless IntegrationAladdin's modern design offers the same hassle-free installation as a standard ceiling light but provides users with a feature-rich projector, and a 360-degree Harman Kardon smart speaker. This eliminates the need for extensive in-ceiling installs and allows Aladdin to effortlessly integrate into existing home decor. Beyond typical projector use cases, Aladdin offers immersive dynamic wallpapers, life-sized interactive children's books, and soothing ambient sounds for bedtime, bringing pure magic to the living space. It was selected as a 2024 CES Innovation Award honoree thanks to its exceptional design and its transformative function in the smart home, in addition to XGIMI's commitment as a brand to push the boundaries of home entertainment technology.\nDedication to Continuous Innovation through Strategic PartnershipsA key strategic partnership the brand is excited to introduce is with MediaTek. The brand stands as a crucial partner for XGIMI, with the entirety of XGIMI's premium product line adopting MediaTek's cutting-edge chips. Together, they've spearheaded a revolutionary transformation in the projector space, fundamentally reshaping the landscape of home entertainment.\nLooking ahead to 2024, MediaTek, in collaboration with Google TV and XGIMI, is set to unveil a range of intelligent projection solutions. This strategic alliance aims to propel a more diverse and immersive home entertainment experience, marking a significant milestone in the evolution of smart projection technology and the companies at the forefront of projector innovation.\nAvailability\u00a0XGIMI is showcasing the HORIZON Max, Aladdin, and other exciting innovations in its 2024 product lineup at CES, January 9-12, 2024, in Central Hall - Booth 22515 of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC).\nTo learn more about the HORIZON Max and other XGIMI products, visit the\u00a0XGIMI Website, or follow @XGIMItech on\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Twitter, and\u00a0LinkedIn.\nAbout XGIMISince 2013, the state-of-the-art XGIMI projectors have helped countless people worldwide to create genuinely immersive audio-visual experiences.
