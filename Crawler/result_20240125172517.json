        "raw_content": "The Best Car And Technology Reveals From CES 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show is more important than ever in the automotive realm.\nCES 2024 has just wrapped up in Las Vegas with a strong showing from automakers and automotive-related tech companies. More than just concepts, these displays preview what will soon be a reality in the cars we drive, which is why we've selected 10 technologies and vehicles revealed at this year's event that will impact the automotive realm.\nOnce again, manufacturers and suppliers brought their A-game. These are our favorite car and technology reveals from CES 2024. We didn't pick these randomly, either; all of these represent technology that will reach the mainstream sooner than you know.\nWhat Is CES And Why Does Matter?\nAutomotive manufacturers and technology producers used to stick to their own lanes, but the line between the two is becoming increasingly blurry. That's why the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has become a popular platform for automakers and suppliers to showcase new automotive technology, and CES 2024 was a hotbed for automotive innovation.\nA decade ago, the most advanced piece of technology in a car was the infotainment system, but we now live in the era of permanently connected vehicles. And let's not forget about electric cars, which run on platforms that have allowed engineers and designers to explore and push through existing automotive boundaries.\n1. Facial Recognition\nContinental Automotive showcased its new Face Authentication Display, which uses biometric recognition to identify the owner and anyone authorized to use whatever car. There are cameras mounted in the B-pillar and instrument cluster. You walk up, and the car recognizes you, unlocks, and activates. And before you ask, the answer is no. You can't access the vehicle using a photograph or mask.\nThe humble car key was good enough for a hundred years, but Mercedes-Benz changed the game when it introduced the W220 S-Class Sedan in 1999. It was the first car equipped with a key that sent out a unique frequency, which unlocked the vehicle as the driver. Nowadays, it's a common piece of tech, and automakers constantly try to outdo each other with new smartphone-based key technology.\nFacial recognition is already widely used in the smartphone industry, and it's only a matter of time before it filters down into cars. This tech could also help detect inebriation, preventing you from driving drunk.\n2. Hyundai Mobis Mobion\nThe Mobion is a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with unique bumpers and lights, but that's not why it's here. It's here because it showcases what's possible when you mount an electric motor within each of the four wheels. Since the wheels are self-contained units, they can rotate individually within the wheel well.\nHyundai Mobis (the automaker's technology arm) used the Mobion to demonstrate Pivot Turn, Diagonal Drive, Zero Turn, and Reverse Drive. It's the most agile car we've ever seen in action, and a system like this will make parking in congested cities like Los Angeles a joy.\n3. BMW's Augmented Reality Glasses\nBMW brought many of its latest gadgets to CES, but the one that stood out was the wearable XREAL Air 2 augmented reality glasses.\nInstead of projecting information on a head-up display, these glasses will force the real and digital realms to unite fantastically. You put them on, and you'll see navigation and hazard information, points of interest, and even entertainment content. The theory is that the world around you can be presented in a new light, and we imagine rod closures, accidents, and even things like potholes can be made visible long before you arrive on the scene. Plus, points of interest like restaurants can be highlighted, and we'd imagine the tech can be extended to allow passengers (particularly children) to play games by interacting with the world around them.\n4. Harman Ready Vision QVUE & AR HUD\nHarman came to CES prepared with several creations OEMs will be studying carefully in the coming months. We're big fans of Ready Vision QVUE and the innovative head-up display. The scalable technology can be easily applied to affordable EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox and high-end luxury barges like the Cadillac Escalade IQ, as the technology can utilize a small area or become a full-width HUD.\nReady Vision projects valuable information on the lower part of the windscreen, and it can utilize augmented reality to project navigation over the road in front of you to enhance the HUD experience. Owners can also install third-party apps from the Harman Ignite Store, adding to the information on display with things like charge states, 3D navigation, and real-time traffic, and you could even order take-out.\n5. VinFast VF 3\nVinFast got off to a rocky start in the USA, but that didn't stop the automaker from introducing the VF 3 at CES.\nWe didn't get many details about the tiny electric SUV, but VinFast provided the most important number: a projected starting price of under $20,000. VinFast is also setting up shop in the USA, which means the VF 3 could potentially qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit.\nApply that, and you get a starting price of $12,500. The estimated range may only be 125 miles, but that low price will be mighty attractive to people who don't travel long distances.\nIf a tiny crossover isn't your thing, the Vietnamese brand also revealed a pickup truck concept called the VF Wild, inspired by superhero costumes.\n6. Kia Platform Beyond Vehicle Solutions\nKia introduced five concept vehicles at CES 2024, showcasing the future of electric commercial vehicles. The PV1, PV5, and PV7 were all designed to be robust, modular, and clever tools. They're boxy by design and boast a weldless body structure that can accommodate interchangeable upper bodies.\nWe'll use the PV5 as an example. During the day, it can be used as a last-mile delivery vehicle. After its shift is done, the owner can put the minivan-like body on top and send it out to serve as a taxi.\n7. Mercedes-Benz And Amazon Music\nMercedes-Benz announced a collaboration with Audible and Amazon Music. The new E-Class and CLE will be the first models to benefit from this partnership, and both features will be rolled out in Q3 this year.\nWhy does this matter? If you're an audiophile, you'll know that Amazon Music with Dolby Atmos was introduced last year. Basically, the sound quality is so good that you feel immersed in it rather than listening to it. In reality, you'll be stuck in traffic but feel like you're in the golden circle at a Pearl Jam concert.\nThis was just one of several pieces of tech the German automaker brought, including a new AI virtual assistant bound for the new CLA-Class and a collaboration with will.i.am that creates music based on your driving inputs.\n8. Volkswagen Golf GTI And ChatGPT\nVolkswagen announced that it will implement ChatGPT into its upcoming infotainment systems, starting with the Mk8.5 Golf GTI, making the voice assistant more powerful. Cerence Chat Pro will back VW's system and will be capable of so much more than turning the temperature up by a few degrees.\nAccording to VW, this will benefit all occupants. You can answer the car questions or converse with it when alone.\nWe're on the fence about this one. On the one hand, having a Golf GTI as a friend would be cool. Conversely, we've seen Her and how prone people are to fall in love with an AI system. Plus, our social battery gets depleted from interacting with people and recharged by driving, so why would we want to detract from our happy place by being forced to converse with it to get basic functions done?\n9. Lamborghini Digital Driver Coach\nWhen it comes to supercars, there's one universal truth. Driving talent doesn't increase in correlation with the size of your wallet. In short, you may have $500,000 to splurge on a Lamborghini Revuelto, but that doesn't mean you have the talent to exploit its capabilities.\nThat's what Lamborghini wants to fix with Telemetry X. This system can send recordings of on-track performance and telemetry to a driving coach who will provide live feedback. It won't make you a Formula 1 ace, but you'll be able to get the most out of the Revuelto's 1,000 horses. It can also tap into your biometrics to provide enhanced coaching, and the virtual assistant will give you feedback as you drive, telling you if you're faster or slower of if your brakes are overheating. It's like having your own version of Gianpiero Lambiase in the car with you.\n10. Zeekr 007\nThe owners of the James Bond IP probably won't allow the Zeekr 007 to go into production sporting that name, but that's not important right now. The fact that Zeekr chose the Las Vegas-based CES to showcase one of its models is a grand statement of intent. The 007 isn't new (it was revealed at the end of December 2023), but this surely means Zeekr wants to become the first Chinese manufacturer to do business in the USA.\nThe Chinese-spec model has a dual-motor setup that produces 636 horsepower and a range of 540 miles. Is that enough to get people out of their Teslas? How will the market respond to a Chinese-built vehicle, especially since the government has made no secret that it does not want China to send its product here?"

Siemens is integrating Amazon Bedrock\u2014a service that offers a choice of high-performing foundation models from leading AI companies via a single API, along with security, privacy, and responsible AI capabilities\u2014with Mendix, the leading low-code platform that is part of the Siemens Xcelerator portfolio. This will allow more customers to build, scale, and supercharge existing applications with the power of generative AI on AWS.\nCustomers can select the generative AI model that best suits their specific use case and quickly and securely incorporate that model into their applications. This will make software development simpler, faster, and more efficient\u2014allowing users to incorporate generative AI functions in just a few clicks.\nWood shared how AWS\u2019s long-standing relationship with Siemens and the CES announcement offers customers a unique opportunity to benefit from generative AI, and the extensive industry knowledge both companies bring to customers across industries.\nPanasonic announced a global collaboration with Amazon to bring Fire TV built in to its new smart TVs starting in 2024. With Fire TV built in and access to Alexa, customers will be able to enjoy a world of entertainment, including live over-the-air content, and streaming apps and services.\nPanasonic also unveiled two new flagship OLED smart TVs with Fire TV built in. The Panasonic Z95A and Z93A models will allow customers to easily launch apps, play music, search for titles, and control compatible smart home devices, using far-field voice control with Alexa. When not in use for viewing content, these TVs transform into dynamic displays with the Fire TV Ambient Experience. The Fire TV Ambient Experience turns the biggest screen in your home into a beautiful, always-smart display that can show personal photos, and glanceable information like calendars and reminders through customizable Alexa widgets. Learn more about the collaboration.\nYour car is the perfect place for a voice assistant\u2014and Amazon and BMW showcased what\u2019s possible with new Alexa LLM-powered capabilities. These new capabilities provide a more natural way of getting to know your new car and allow it to take select actions on your behalf. Instead of digging through your car manual, you can ask BMW\u2019s assistant for things like recommendations on different BMW drive modes and then have the assistant activate your chosen mode. You can also ask for instructions on how car features work\u2014like the parking assistance system\u2014and hear explanations in easy-to-understand terms through the BMW assistant\u2019s customized voice.\nThis demo follows Amazon\u2019s previous announcement that BMW\u2019s next-generation Intelligent Personal Assistant will be supported through our Alexa Custom Assistant technology (ACA). Both companies are firm believers that voice technology can strip away complexity and minimize distractions in the car.\nAmazon is a long-time supporter of using open technology standards to give customers more choice over the devices and services they use in their homes. That\u2019s also why Amazon is a founding member and key contributor to the Matter Standard. At CES, Amazon announced Matter Casting, which enables customers to cast content to Fire TV and Echo Show 15 devices directly from supported streaming apps on iOS and Android. Customers can begin watching a movie or browse for their next favorite show from Prime Video on their phone, and cast it to their compatible Fire TV device or Echo Show 15. This is an industry-first demonstration of implementing Matter Casting.\n\u201cWe are excited to work with Amazon to bring Matter Casting to the STARZ app. Matter has been easy to integrate and will provide even more options for customers to enjoy our extensive collection of original series and popular films on their device of choice,\u201d said Alison Hoffman, STARZ President of Domestic Networks.\nMatter Casting is available now for customers around the world who want to cast Prime Video content from iOS and Android devices to Echo Show 15. It will be coming to compatible Fire TV devices in the coming months, including smart TVs from Panasonic with Fire TV built in. We\u2019re working with Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, STARZ, and ZDF to add Matter Casting support later this year.\nFollowing a year of key milestones, including becoming the first company in history to operate a purpose-built robotaxi on public roads with passengers, Zoox showcased the latest generation of its purpose-built vehicle at CES 2024. Zoox also offered an exclusive opportunity to CES attendees to join its early-bird waitlist and be among the first to sign up for its autonomous ride hailing service.\nIn 2023, we introduced new tools that would make it easier and faster for developers to use generative AI to build conversational experiences with Alexa. Starting today, customers can try some of these new developer-built experiences for themselves.\nWith Character.ai, Alexa customers can have just-for-fun conversations with different Characters\u2014including getting motivated with fitness coaches, gaining insight from historical figures such as Socrates, receiving book recommendations from Librarian Linda, playing RPGs with Text Adventure Game, and more.\nSplash is connecting its AI-powered music creation technology with Alexa. Customers can interact with the Splash experience to create their own song and personalize elements like genre, lyrics, and more\u2014all through voice. From there, customers can send the song they made to their mobile phone.\nVoice AI game developer Volley announced the launch of its AI-powered \u201c20 Questions\u201d\u2014a deeper version of the well-known parlor game, which uses generative AI to interact with customers through questions and engaging conversation.\nIn addition to featuring its own products, Amazon showcased a selection of Alexa Fund portfolio companies at CES. This included MultiOn, a new personal artificial intelligence agent. MultiOn displayed its browser experience, which lets customers use the agent to accomplish tasks such as reserving a table at a restaurant, or inviting your friends to dinner\u2014all on autopilot. Embodied, Inc., a company focused on AI-powered robotics companions, also showed off the evolution of its Moxie Robot\u2014Moxie AI\u2014which will offer children emotional and academic support. It will be available to purchase in 2024.\nAlexa Fund invests in technologies and startups that are fueling innovation in areas like artificial intelligence, smart devices and new media.\nWant more CES 2024 news?

Touted as the world\u2019s first dual-motor, dual-battery e-bike, this carbon fiber electric bicycle boasts an onboard AI assistant.The frame is made of top-of-the-line carbon fiber, and riders can go up to 15mph with a range of up to 124 miles with the battery extender (or a 75-mile range without). It features dual-drive 500w front and rear motors, dual drive and throttle modes, a Shimano CUES derailleur, all-terrain tires and an air suspension fork \u2014 all so you can ride through the city, suburbs or trails.Riders can ask the e-bike\u2019s ChatGPT (through the built-in speaker) for route information and more. The Fusion comes with Urtopia\u2019s standard bike features such as phone-free navigation and GPS, Bluetooth, a biometric lock and a movement alarm. An upgraded version, the Fusion CVT, offers premium features such as an Enviolo stepless shifter.The bike can sync with Urtopia\u2019s soon-to-launch smart ring that tracks wearers\u2019 fitness and health; both will be available starting in July.\nBougeRV 12-V Colorful Refrigerators\nAt CES 2024, BougeRV added a stylish splash to its electric cooler lineup with new spring-ready hues of its 12-volt mini fridges. Available in purple, pink and mint, the 23-quart refrigerators power up within 16 minutes, offering freezing (with no ice needed) or cooling from -7 degrees to 50 degrees Fahrenheit. It holds up to 32 soda cans and doubles as a charger for your tech gear.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District is an electric eMoto that\u2019s part e-bike, e-moped and e-motorcycle all in one stylish and powerful design. It\u2019s made with a waterproof and backlit LCD display for gauge readouts, while it has a total range between 40 to 120 miles with a top speed of 70 mph. The bike\u2019s battery is swappable too, which means you can use one while the other is charging.The Land District weighs up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick, while it comes in two styles \u2014 The Scrambler for off-roading and The Street for city use. Both models start at $6,995.\nPebble Flow All-Electric Smart RV\nFrom the effortless self-attaching \u201cmagic hitch\u201d\nand the 270-degree panoramic views inside, to the aerodynamic design and EV battery that lets travelers stay off the grid for up to seven days, there are many things to love about the Pebble\u2019s all-electric Flow RV. Per the company, it\u2019s equipped with the world\u2019s first dual-motor active propulsion assist system, which automatically maximizes the vehicle\u2019s range by making it more aerodynamic and easier and safer to tow. It sleeps up to four and powers all of its appliances (a full-sized fridge, a removable induction cooktop and a four-in-one convection microwave), while rooftop solar panels allow the vehicle to self-charge under direct sunlight. The vehicle can be charged at home or at public charging stations and campgrounds, and digital nomads will love the Starlink compatibility.The Flow measures 25 feet long by 7\u20196\u2033 wide by 8\u20198\u2033 tall, and weighs 6,200 pounds when fully loaded. Packages range from $109,000 for the standard configuration to $125,000 with the Magic Pack.\nMercedes-AMG MBUX Sound Drive\nThe Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an electric luxury vehicle that features an impressive infotainment sound system that enhances songs for an \u201cinteractive musical experience.\u201d Brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am from hip hop group Black Eyed Peas, MBUX Sound Drive gives the driver the power to \u201cre-imagine\u201d music based on the car\u2019s acceleration and movement. For example: If the car is at a stop light, elements like vocals begin to get softer in the background and the bass increases in volume, while they\u2019re brought back up when the car accelerates down the street. Drums may kick in when the car hits a certain speed, another musical element could come in when the car makes a left turn, or a right turn could make another element like keyboards drive the song forward. This transforms the music in real-time into a new immersive experience for the driver and everyone in the car.During a brief test drive in Las Vegas, we saw how MBUX Sound Drive uses software and sensors to manipulate music into something new and different. It brings up elements and details in a song that might go unnoticed otherwise. It\u2019s a unique driving experience that really has to be experienced.Right now, MBUX Sound Drive is expected to be released this summer with an over-the-air update for select 2024 Mercedes-AMG models.\nPivotal Helix Single-Seat Personal Aerial Vehicle\nThe future has landed: flying cars have arrived (kind of) in the form of Pivotal\u2019s Helix. One of the most intriguing things about the company\u2019s single-seat personal aerial vehicle? You don\u2019t need an FAA pilot license to get behind the wheel, however, the company notes that \u201crigorous simulator and flight training sessions are required for pilot qualification\u201d at its customer center in Palo Alto, Calif. Starting at $190,000, the 348-pound light eVTOL (electric vertical takeoff and landing) can soar up to 5,000 feet above sea level in class G airspace (the only noncontrolled portion of airspace in the U.S.), allowing pilots to travel about 20 miles, or for about two hours at just over 60 miles per hour. Classified as FAA part 103 (ultralight vehicle), Helix is constructed with carbon fiber composite and disassembles into three pieces to fit into a 16-ft. storage trailer, and the amphibious hull allows the vehicle to float in water for emergency landings.

As the automotive industry is undergoing a transformative period, CES has emerged as a crucial platform for unveiling groundbreaking technological advancements. Even as traditional auto shows decline, CES stands out as the premier event for automotive announcements, attracting major brands from around the world.\nFor automotive enthusiasts, this event is a window into the future, revealing the cutting-edge developments that major car manufacturers have in store. This year, the focus is not much on flashy vehicle debuts but on in-cabin tech innovation, reflecting the industry's shift toward connected, electric and autonomous vehicles.\nNotably, the Detroit Big 3 automakers \u2014 including General Motors, Ford and Stellantis \u2014 won\u2019t be participating at the CES this year following disruptions caused by the historic UAW strike in late 2023. Despite notable absences, including major U.S. automakers and industry disruptors like Tesla, the stage is set for an exciting showcase from global giants like Honda HMC, Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen VWAGY, BMW AG BMWYY and Mercedes-Benz MBGAF.\nHonda's Leap Into the EV Future\nAmong the automakers, Honda is expected to take center stage at CES 2024 with the debut of its all-new global electric vehicle (EV) series. Aligned with its ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, Honda plans to introduce 30 EVs globally, targeting a sales volume of 2 million units by 2030. This move is part of Honda's broader strategy to achieve 100% zero-emission automobile sales by 2040, a mix of battery and fuel cell electric models.\nThe CES debut of this new series marks a significant transformation in Honda's approach to sustainable mobility. Honda's CES showcase will not only feature the new EV series but also highlight key technologies shaping the brand's transformation.\nKia's Visionary Mobility Platform\nKia\u2019s showcase at CES 2024 revolves around its groundbreaking modular EV platform, the Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV). This platform underpins three all-electric concept cars \u2014 PV1, PV5 and PV7, each catering to different segments of personal and B2B mobility.

The German auto giant\u2019s focus on the digital customer experience emphasizes the integration of cutting-edge technology in everyday vehicle use.\nMercedes-Benz's AI-Powered MBUX Virtual Assistant\nMercedes-Benz is set to impress with the unveiling of its new MBUX Virtual Assistant at CES 2024, aiming to redefine the digital passenger experience. This AI-powered feature represents a leap in personalization and human-like interaction between driver and car. The MBUX Virtual Assistant, part of Mercedes-Benz's vision for connected driving, promises an empathetic and responsive in-car experience.\nOla K\u00e4llenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, emphasizes the empathetic qualities of the MBUX Virtual Assistant, stating that it complements the driver's style and mood. This technology is set to gradually appear in passenger vehicles over the coming years, marking a significant leap toward connected and personalized driving experiences.\nVolkswagen's ChatGPT Integration\nVolkswagen will take a leap into artificial intelligence by integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its IDA voice assistant. This move makes Volkswagen the first volume manufacturer to offer ChatGPT as a standard feature, starting in the second quarter of 2024. The integration of OpenAI\u2019s chatbot across VW\u2019s lineup, including Tiguan, Passat, Golf, and its ID family of electric vehicles, highlights the automaker's commitment to cutting-edge technology and enhanced customer experience.\nThe AI-based chatbot enhances the voice assistant's capabilities, providing relevant responses and control over entertainment. Volkswagen's partnership with Cerence ensures a robust integration of ChatGPT, marking a significant step toward AI-driven interactions within vehicles.\nFlying Cars on Display\nCES 2024 will showcase two companies presenting \"flying cars.\" XPeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's XPeng Inc., will introduce an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Hyundai's Advanced Air Mobility company, Supernal, will also showcase an eVTOL vehicle prototype, highlighting the growing interest and innovation in the aerial mobility sector.\nConclusion\nCES 2024 paints a futuristic picture of the automotive industry, with a focus on technology that goes beyond traditional vehicle design.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Highlights: Unveiling the Future of Automotive Technology\nOver the last decade, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has grown to include more carmakers, which makes sense considering how much technology goes into vehicles nowadays. This year sees some far-fetched concepts as well as several innovations that will be available next year. Understandably, electric vehicles are a huge part of the show along with a slew of new entertainment features.\nWhat Automakers Brought to CES 2024\nHonda\nHonda unveiled two concepts: The Saloon and the Space-Hub. These wildly futuristic models showcase the company's creativity while also giving us a sneak peek at what to expect in the near-term. The Saloon is a sleek wedge-like passenger EV that prioritizes lightweight construction and an expansive interior. Instead of a traditional steering wheel, the designers went with a yoke that is intended to be steer-by-wire.\nThe Space-Hub concept has a similar yoke, but that's where the similarities end. This van features a transparent roof, giving passengers the kind of scenic possibilities we'd see in ther observation car of a luxury train. Honda also unveiled a new \"H\" logo that will debut on the first batch of Honda 0 (zero) Series EVs in 2026.\nHyundai\nHyundai typically unveils a futuristic concept at CES, and this year's isn't even intended for the road. Supernal is Hyundai's Advanced Air Mobility company and brought the S-A2, a tilt-rotor electric four-passenger aircraft. It's designed to fly at 120 mph at 1,500 feet, filling the role of an aerial commuter for city trips up to miles. More impressively, the S-A2 is quiet, with a claim of only 65 decibels at takeoff and 45 db when in level flight. There's no word on if or when we'll see one in the air, but Supernal intends to enter the market in 2028.\nHyundai's HTWO brand also unveiled a bold vision of a hydrogen infrastructure, from production to storage and distribution. The strategy also includes provisions to supply hydrogen for industrial and business applications. It all fits in well with Hyundai's goal of reaching carbon neutrality by 2050.\nKia\nKia has been sitting toward the vangaurd of EV tech, and at CES 2024, it pulled the covers off a new series of electric vans with some very clever tricks. The modular platform of the Concept PV5 will allow owners to swap out one body for another with relative ease. That means you can use it as a work van for cargo or services, then switch that body for family duties when needed. Production is slated to begin in 2025 and five bodies will be offered: Basic, Van, High Roof, Robotaxi, and Chassis Cab.\nA smaller PV1 will follow it to market, along with a larger PV7. The only problem is Kia hasn't decided if it will bring it to the U.S. yet.\nMercedes-Benz\nMercedes-Benz went big at CES, with a ton of new tech and new partnerships, but the scene-stealer is the Concept CLA-Class that was unveiled last fall. This entry-level EV is a real head-turner, with graceful curves, sleek lines, and delectable details. According to Mercedes-Benz, the production version will inherit as much as 70 percent of the concept's traits and has a target range of 400 miles.\nRapper and producer will.i.am went well beyond his role as a brand ambassador and helped develop the new Sound Drive feature. This system uses specially composed music that is influenced by the driver's actions. Drive with some verve and the music swells, with sound effects mixed in. It sounds cheesy, but we actually got to try it out on the road and can attest, it's pretty cool. In essence, you can play DJ by creating your own mix as you whittle away the miles.\nMercedes' praiseworthy MBUX infotainment system is already one of the best, and the new Virtual Assistant takes it to yet another level. Using advanced artificial intelligence (AI), the feature provides more natural human-like interactions via voice and on-screen. It can be linked to your calendar to keep you on time as well as suggest calling into a meeting if you're running late. It also adjusts the voice to better match the operator's mood, whether they're happy or serious.\nOn the partnership side, Mercedes-Benz joined forces with several companies to deliver more in-car entertainment. Antstream Arcade will bring streaming gaming for when you're charging or making use of the Drive Pilot self-driving feature. Sony Pictures has been brought in to deliver its film library for streaming through the new Ridevu app. Amazon Music and Audible have upped the ante with an immersive sound experience thanks to Dolby Atmos audio. Audiobooks and podcasts will be much more engaging, especially if you try out the \"audio movies\" that are being produced.\nVinfast\nAfter launching the VF8 in the United States last year, Vietnamese carmaker Vinfast showed its VF Wild electric pickup truck concept at CES 2024. There's no word, however, on whether it will make it into production. This midsize truck concept features rear-hinged rear doors, allowing for a positively massive doorway when both doors are open. Also unveiled was the VF3, a tiny two-door SUV, and it is coming to the U.S. and is aiming for 125 miles of range. It's a charming little ute, but Vinfast's rocky start last year has us cautiously optimistic.\nVolkswagen\nVolkswagen announced it will integrate ChatGPT AI into its infotainment system, bringing much more power to voice controls. As with systems in BMWs and Mercedes, it will be capable of natural speech commands when you trigger the system by saying, \"Hello Ida\". Not only can you use it for the typical navigation and feature controls, but also as a tour guide. Want to know about an odd landmark? Just ask. ChatGPT will be available in Volkswagen vehicles later this year, but it's not clear if it will be offered in the U.S.\nRelated Topics\nRead More CarGurus Tips and Advice\nMark Takahashi has been in the automotive world since 2001 and over the years has contributed to Edmunds, Car and Driver, Autoblog, and TrueCar.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Roundup: Automotive Highlights from the World's Largest Tech Show\nSummary\nRelated Articles\nSummary\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas is where some of the biggest tech news of the year is announced. More than 4,000 exhibitors are at the show this year, with cutting-edge tech covering nearly every area imaginable. It\u2019s the cars we\u2019re interested in, though, and there were plenty of announcements from automakers ranging from new audio systems to entirely new models. Here are the automotive highlights of CES 2024.\nGoogle Built-In\nGoogle announced updates to Android Auto that would add real-time EV range information to Google Maps. The feature will launch with the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, showing you the estimated battery level at arrival, suggesting charge stops, and estimating charging times along the way. Volvo EVs and some GM EVs already have this feature, and it\u2019s very helpful because it helps curb range anxiety. It adds predictability, offers more choice, and lets you select your route based on your charge without relying on the car\u2019s built-in navigation system.\nGoogle Built-In, the operating system used by Volvo and GM, among others, is adding the Chrome web browser (for use when parked). The system also adds The Weather Channel app to show you the weather along your route.\nHonda EV Concepts\nHonda brought two concept cars to debut what it calls the Honda 0 (Zero) Series, a new line of EVs that will launch in 2026. \u201cThe mobility we dream of is not an extension of the trend of \u2018thick, heavy, but smart\u2019 EVs,\u201d said Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda. \u201cWe will create a completely new value from zero based on thin, light and wise as the foundation for our new Honda 0 EV series to further advance the joy and freedom of mobility to the next level.\u201d\nThe concept above with the rectangular nose and gullwing doors is called the Saloon. Its stance is low and wide. Honda says a vehicle based on this concept will arrive in 2026, and it marks not just a new era for Honda electrification, but its styling is nothing like what we've seen from the brand so far.\nThe chunkier concept is called the Space-Hub. Honda didn\u2019t mention if we\u2019d see something in production based on this one, but it might preview what an Odyssey minivan might look like in the future.\nHonda 0 Series models will get the company\u2019s most advanced autonomous driving features. They will also have new e-Axles that the company says will deliver high levels of power and efficiency, along with a battery that Honda says will not degrade more than 10 per cent after 10 years of use.\nHyundai All-In on Hydrogen\nHyundai presented its vision for hydrogen-powered vehicles including passenger vehicles and heavy trucks going forward. The brand remains heavily invested in the tech and plans to develop new large-scale green hydrogen production solutions. It is also concentrating on tech that can deliver hydrogen for vehicles from organic waste (including manure) as well as from melting waste plastics.\nThe company said it expects to have vehicles using 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, enough to drive a passenger vehicle 3 billion km. For reference, passenger vehicle traffic in Canada is approximately 333 billion km per year.\nKia Shows Electric Vans\nKia brought a series of concepts for a future commercial electric van. The Platform Beyond Vehicle concepts offer innovative features like vehicle bodies that can be removed and swapped out quickly. Kia suggests that you could use the van for a taxi by day, a delivery van by night, and a camper on the weekend. Kia emphasized software in the concepts, with the goal of improved charge management and better fleet management. The first planned for production is the PV5, the second largest of the four, built at a new plant capable of handling 150,000 units per year.\nLamborghini Performance Biometrics\nThe Lamborghini Telemetry X concept is in-car tech meant to make you a better driver on track. It captures your biometric data for performance monitoring to help you train off the track and monitors your lap times, lines, and pedal performance to help make you faster. Lamborghini says the system offers proactive voice assistance in the vehicle to help you brake and turn at the right spot.\nMercedes Debuts New Infotainment System\nMercedes-Benz announced that its new MB.OS system, first announced two years ago, will make it into vehicles soon. It will offer an AI virtual assistant that Benz says will \u201ccreate an even more natural and intuitive relationship with the car.\u201d The company says the system will allow more natural interaction with the car\u2019s voice command system. It will also include enhanced 3D graphics for the navigation system that can show the driver hazards around the road. More apps will be added, including games, streaming, and even food-ordering apps.\nIn collaboration with Amazon Music and Audible, Benz will add Dolby Atmos to its Burmester audio systems. Benz says Atmos audio, used in movie theatres to provide a more immersive experience, should do the same for in-car listeners. \u201cImmersive audio storytelling enables our customers to benefit fully from the advanced sound technology in our vehicles. For us, unparalleled in-car entertainment is a further dimension of the hyper-personalized user experience,\u201d said Mercedes-Benz CTO Markus Sch\u00e4fer.\nVinFast Shows Cute EV and Wild Pickup Concept\nElectric startup VinFast Auto brought a pair of concepts including the minicar VF 3 and the VF wild pickup concept.\nThe VF 3 is on sale now in Vietnam and is making its debut for the rest of the world \u2013 though there are no details on Canadian availability. It\u2019s small, about half a metre shorter than a Mitsubishi Mirage, and offers an estimated 202 km of range, which isn\u2019t bad considering the $15k price tag in its home country.\nVinFast\u2019s first pickup, the VF Wild, is likely to be much more relevant to Canadians if it makes it to market. The Wild is about the size of a Honda Ridgeline, but powered by electricity. It offers a flexible bed with a midgate (the new EV pickup hot ticket) that lets you extend the bed by using the back seats of the cab, and it has clamshell doors like the best early 2000s trucks. It\u2019s still just a concept, though, with no announcements of any production plans.\nVolkswagen's New AI Assistant\nVolkswagen announced a new digital assistant called IDA, based on ChatGPT AI. VW says it will control infotainment including navigation as well as climate control. It can also answer general knowledge questions and have a conversation with you. The refreshed Golf will get the feature, along with the ID.3, 4, 5, and ID.7 models, as well as the new Tiguan, with arrivals starting in 2024.\nVW also showed off the refreshed Golf GTI. Though the hot hatch was masked by camouflage, we can see some of the detailing including new head and tail lights.\nRelated Articles\nAbout Us\nDealer Services\nResources\nPartners\nCustomer Support"
