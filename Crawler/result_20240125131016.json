        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

These brands and products were chosen based on usefulness, function, innovation and overall cool factor.\nWe narrowed down the winners in a number of categories from laptops to robot vacuums and smart home devices to 4K TVs. We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar. The LG Soundbar S95TR is a 9.1.5-channel sound system that comes with 65-inch soundbar with three up-firing speakers, rear speakers and a subwoofer for your TV, while the system is Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and DTS:X compatible for immersive and detailed audio.

Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line.

It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels. It has a 1000R curvature, 7680 x 2160 4K resolution with up to 120Hz for smooth motion and action when gaming, while it has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits.

This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. It has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode, so you can have different settings for different walls in your home. So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action. The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nLana Del Rey Channels Old Hollywood Screen Sirens in Skims' Valentine's Day Line -- Here's When It Launches Online\nA New 'Barbie' Book Will Reveal Margot Robbie's Never-Before-Seen Press Tour Looks, Rare Mattel Photos and More\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office. It\u2019s expected to launch on Amazon this year.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\n\u2018Masters of the Air\u2019: Where to Watch the World War II Drama Miniseries Online\n\u2018Euphoria\u2019 Stars Zendaya and Hunter Schafer Stun at Schiaparelli\u2019s Alien-Inspired Paris Couture Show\nThe Best LED Face Masks for Addressing Every Type of Skin Concern\nKansas City Chiefs vs. Baltimore Ravens: How to Stream the AFC Championship Game Online Free\nWhere to Stream the 2024 Oscar-Nominated Films Online\nTory Burch x Humberto Leon\u2019s New L.A.

        "raw_content": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Quiller Media, Inc.\nContact Us | Privacy Policy\nHere are the best new devices from CES Unveiled 2024\nCES Unveiled 2024\nOn Sunday, CES 2024 kicked off with its annual Unveiled media event that highlights various brands launching new products for the coming year. AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design. He started producing vid...\n3 Comments\npulseimages\nWas hoping Nintendo would give more info on the upcoming Switch successor.\nbeowulfschmidt\nSeems more likely for them to hold their own event for that, especially now that E3 is history.\nlaytech\nAre those sponsored devices in that article as nothing interested me whatsoever.

Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\n It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go.",

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nBest of CES 2024: ZDNET editors' top picks\nThe ZDNET team scoured CES 2024 to find the most innovative new tech and the most exciting new products to share with our audience of professionals and tech enthusiasts. We have lots of lists summing up the best TVs, best laptops, best robots, best headphones, best mobile accessories, and more.\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nAlso: CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nBut we also wanted to give you a list of our absolute top picks from CES that we think will be most worth your hard-earned money when they launch in 2024. And naturally, we also wanted to highlight the best innovations -- products that you may not buy but are worth knowing about because they could influence other products that you may want to bring into your life in the future. So here they are.\nSamsung S95D OLED: Best TV\nTV innovation was everywhere at CES 2024 with transparent TVs, over 100-inch QLEDs, folding TVs, and 8K projectors. But the best TV of the show had a more subtle upgrade that will have a much bigger impact on the quality of the everyday viewing experience. The Samsung S95D OLED TV unveiled a glare-free display that offers the best qualities of anti-reflective screens while maintaining the intense colors and excellent dynamic range that make OLED the top technology for picture quality. We tested the glare-free display with an intense phone camera flash and were amazed at how well it dispersed the light. This means that you can now use this TV in the brightest rooms -- one of the biggest challenges for OLED TVs. I'm confident that will give this the TV with the best picture quality on the market when it launches this spring. It will likely cost around $2,500, until it gets discounted around Black Friday.\nSamsung S95D\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid: Best laptop\nWe've tested and seen plenty of 2-in-1 computers at ZDNET, but there's none quite like Lenovo's new ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid. That's because this is the world's first 2-in-1 Windows PC and Android tablet, meaning as you detach the 14-inch OLED display from the keyboard, the device automatically converts into the Android operating system. On top of that, you can still connect the bottom keyboard portion of the 2-in-1 to an external monitor, giving you, essentially, two computers to work with.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nTimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub: Best AI device\nIn the past year, we have seen major leaps in the AI space, which led to a boom in translation technology at CES. The TimeKettle X1 made delivers real-time translations in up to 40 languages, with nearly no latency and high accuracy, which I got the chance to experience myself. The device itself fits in the palm of your and includes a screen that displays transcriptions of your conversation and two earbuds that two people can wear for real-time in-ear translations during a one-on-one conversation. There are a series of modes, making it ideal for every situation you may need a translation. If you sync different hubs, it can provide real-time translations for up to 20 people in five different languages, aimed for use in classrooms and meetings. The product is already available for $699 on the TimeKettle website.\nTimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub\nMSI Claw: Best gaming device\nIn what is becoming one of the hottest product categories in recent years, the Taiwanese computer maker's first gaming handheld impresses with the latest Intel Core Ultra processor for AI enhancements to performance and gaming, a more ergonomic design (with plenty of ventilation) than its competition, and USB-C Thunderbolt support for external monitor use. The LCD display falls short to its OLED rivals, but the gaming potential of this handheld should more than compensate for it. It will start at $699 and arrive later this year.\nMSI Claw\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar: Best tech accessory\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar offers the same types of insights a fitness tracker for humans would. You place the attachment on your dog's collar and on the app you will have access to data about your dog's heart health, activity, appetite, and more. The attachment can also track your dog's location, eliminating the need for additional trackers such as AirTags. One of the most important features is its ability to detect early symptoms of heart disease, potentially saving your dog's life. The Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category since it is through AI that the collar can detect your dog's activities, such as sleeping, walking, and more. The Minitailz Smart Dog Collar is already available for $99, and it requires a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar\nHoloconnect Holobox: Best innovation overall\nThe Holoconnect Holobox makes it possible to talk to someone via a hologram with near-zero latency. It's a \"plug and play\" system, so all you need to do is plug it in and connect it to the internet to get started. To be a hologram yourself, you need a white background that is well-lit, and then you can carry on like it is a regular video call. It is already available for consumer use, and we even saw Google use the Holobox to showcase its Android characters in fun and innovative ways at CES 2024. The price is not disclosed on the Holoconnect website, but interested customers can request a pricing list. It's very expensive and most people aren't going to want to put this phone booth sized box in their living room, but the idea of video calls of the future becoming holograms is super compelling.\nHoloconnect Holobox\nTCL 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV: Best TV innovation\nThe recent trend in Laser TV and ultra short throw (UST) projectors has spawned a wave of interest in 100-inch and 120-inch screens to create a more cinema-like experience at home. At CES, Samsung even unveiled an 8K projector that goes up to 150 inches. The challenge with these projectors is that they're never going to have the same level of dynamic range, brightness, or color intensity as today's best OLED and QLED TVs. TCL had an answer to that at CES with the announcement of its 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV. We were highly impressed with the picture quality of this QLED display in a private demo. It's an extension of TCL's QM8 series, which ZDNET and others have rated as one of the best TVs on the market. The TCL 115QM891G (the official product name) kicks it up a notch with 5,000 nits of brightness and 20,000 local dimming zones to drive excellent dynamic range and sharp colors. Pricing wasn't announced but it will likely cost around $20,000 and it will be available at Best Buy. That makes it an ultra-premium purchase, but if you have the space and the budget then you can now get a projector-level screen size with the benefits of the latest advances in QLED picture quality.\nTCL 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV\nRabbit: Best AI innovation\nWhat if AI assistants could do more than just give you the best search results and leave you to do the rest? What if they could book an Airbnb for you, shop for groceries online and checkout, or start a return for that impulsive Black Friday purchase? That's what the folks at Rabbit are touting with R1, its new $199 pocket device that operates on a \"Large Action Model\". Made in partnership with Teenage Engineering, the R1 may be the first of many AI hardware releases in 2024. The ball is now in the court of the world's biggest tech giants to deliver superior voice assistant experiences to match the capabilities of what Rabbit has come up with.\nRabbit R1\nSony XR headset: Best VR/AR innovation\nSony gave us the biggest shocker of CES 2024 in the opening keynote of the show when it partnered with Siemens to unveil an XR headset with high-end specs and an attractive Sony design. While this headset has the oomph to compete with Apple Vision Pro, it's not aimed at a general consumer audience but is focused directly on professionals, engineers, and designers to help them accelerate product development and create spatial content experiences that could ultimately run on Vision Pro, Meta Quest, and other headsets and smart glasses. This product will have the potential to save a lot of time and resources for companies in flying people around the globe or shipping prototypes to collaborate on and finalize their products. They'll do this by creating \"digital twins\" in virtual spaces such as Siemens NX Immersive Designer. Sony won't sell the headset as a standalone device, but it will be bundled with Siemens' platform and other software packages for specific industries. That will include an entertainment industry bundle that Sony wants to use to empower the next generation of digital storytellers to build immersive 3D experiences.\nSony XR headset\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES 2024 Day 2: The 8 announcements that intrigued us most\nThe best smart home tech at CES 2024"

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!
