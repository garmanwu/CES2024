In passing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, I pushed for funding to support the future of a clean energy economy,\u201d said U.S. Senator Dick Durbin. \u201cWith so many expert Illinois organizations collaborating on MachH2, I am confident that this Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub proposal will make for a sound investment for the Department of Energy. Hydrogen promises to play a critical role in decarbonizing the transportation sector, and MachH2 demonstrates that Illinois stands ready to deliver on that promise.\u201d\n\u201cWith Illinois\u2019s robust array of thought leaders, world-class institutions and innovative laboratories, it only makes sense that our great state should be home to the Midwestern Hydrogen hub,\u201d said U.S. Senator Tammy Duckworth. \u201cIllinois\u2019s leadership in clean energy combined with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\u2019s clean energy provisions is a recipe for positive change to our energy economy and a better protected environment for years to come.\u201d\n\u201cIllinois is home to a robust nuclear energy sector and is a leader in renewable energy resources,\u201d said Representative Darin LaHood. \u201cAs our nation navigates growing energy challenges, Illinois will play a critical role in supporting an all-of-the-above energy approach that restores American energy independence and strengthens our economy. With strong collaboration from many of Illinois\u2019 leading institutions, MachH2 would make an excellent choice for the Department of Energy\u2019s Midwestern Clean Hydrogen Hub.\u201d\nBelow is a sampling of MachH2 members and the alliance is expected to grow as more parties are identified:\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Air Liquide\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 American Center for Mobility\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Atlas Agro\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Argonne National Laboratory\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Avina Clean Hydrogen Inc.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Big Rivers Electric\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Bloom Energy\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Champaign Urbana Mass Transit District\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chicago Metropolitan Agency for Planning\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chicago NSBE\u2019s The Chicago STEM Foundation\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chicago State University\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ComEd\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Constellation\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Current\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Discovery Partners Institute\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Exelon\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Governors State University\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 GTI Energy \u2022 Holtec International\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Hydrogen Technologies Inc\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Idaho National Laboratory\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Institute for Work & the Economy\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Invenergy \u2022 LanzaJet, Inc.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 LanzaTech\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Marquis, Inc.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Mass Transportation Authority-Flint\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mHUB\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Michels\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Missouri University of Science and Technology\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nalco Water, an Ecolab Company\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nikola Motor\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Nicor Gas\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 NiSource Inc\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Plug Power\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Pratt Miller\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0Rockwell Automation\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Swagelok Chicago\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Syntex Industries\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University of Chicago\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University of Illinois Chicago\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University of Illinois System\n\u2022\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0University of Illinois Urbana Champaign\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University of Kentucky\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University of Michigan\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University of Minnesota Twin Cities College of Science and Engineering\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 University of Wisconsin Madison\nMembers of the alliance will combine resources and expertise to:\nDon\u2019t Miss an Update!\nJoin our mailing list to receive regular updates about DPI events, news, and the latest on our tech talent and research clusters.\n\u00a9 2024 Discovery Partners Institute"

        "raw_content": "In $8 billion federal quest to decarbonize, Midwest to build one of seven regional clean hydrogen hubs\nThe Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen - includes Illinois, Indiana and Michigan - was selected this month to receive $1 billion to develop a Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub by the federal Department of Energy.\nThe alliance represents more than 70 partners, including the University of Illinois system and Argonne National Laboratory in DuPage County.\nKnown at MachH2, the coalition came to fruition last year to compete for the national program, which aims to form a foundation for a clean hydrogen network in the U.S.\nMachH2 was selected alongside six other organizations to form \"H2Hubs.\" The hubs, to be located across the country in regions such as Appalachia, California and the Gulf Coast, are expected to collectively offset 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. That's roughly equivalent to the combined annual emissions of 5.5 million gasoline-powered cars.\nWhile hydrogen has been around as a fuel alternative for decades - most famously as rocket fuel for NASA - it typically has not been \"clean.\" As the country struggles to decarbonize hard-to-electrify sectors such as heavy-duty transportation, petroleum refining and steel, ways to produce hydrogen with little-to-no carbon emissions have emerged as a potential silver bullet.\n\"Hydrogen is actually the most abundant element in the universe. They say 75% of all matter is made up of hydrogen,\" MachH2 Chief Integration Officer Neil Banwart said. \"There are some unique characteristics that hydrogen has over other forms of energy.\"\nFor one, hydrogen fuel cells are more energy dense than the batteries used in electric vehicles. That means a heavy-duty truck fitted with a hydrogen fuel system has less weight to carry around and can drive longer distances before refueling. Those vehicles also can be refueled much faster than their electric counterparts can.\nIf clean hydrogen is so great, what's the holdup? Hydrogen hasn't gone mainstream as a green alternative fuel yet for two main reasons: it's expensive and the infrastructure isn't there yet.\nThat's where the regional hubs are meant to come into play. The federal government is putting its $7 billion toward these hubs to create a currently nonexistent network of clean hydrogen producers, consumers and connective infrastructure - while supporting the production, storage, delivery and end-use of clean hydrogen.\nAll the while, researchers at places like Argonne are looking into how to make cells that are cheaper and more efficient.\nHousing one of the largest hydrogen and fuel cell programs in the national laboratory system, Argonne's research looks at improving the performance and durability of today's fuel cells to lower their costs. The lab will continue that work through its membership with MachH2.\nTed Krause, Argonne's chemical engineering department head, added another challenge to widespread deployment of clean hydrogen is that new technologies need to be developed, demonstrated and proven in many of the new markets being targeted for hydrogen.\n\"These technologies are really at the early stages in the developmental cycle,\" Krause said in an email.\nHydrogen fuel is made from natural gas by a process called steam methane reforming, which produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct. For every ton of hydrogen produced, about 10 tons of CO2 are released to the atmosphere, Krause said.\nBut, there are two ways to produce hydrogen with little to no production and release of carbon dioxide: electricity and the capture and sequestration of carbon.\nIf carbon capture and sequestration technologies are integrated into today's natural gas process, we could see a significant reduction in CO2 emissions, experts say.\nAlternatively, electricity can be used to split water into its component molecules of hydrogen and oxygen. This electrolysis produces hydrogen with no carbon dioxide emissions - if the electricity is generated from clean energy sources such as wind, solar or nuclear energy.\n\"Hydrogen produced by these processes with little or no CO2 emissions is referred to as 'clean' hydrogen and this is why hydrogen is considered so vital in the quest to decarbonize our energy sector,\" Krause said.\nWith the incoming federal funding, the wheels currently in motion to pursue widespread clean hydrogen in Illinois will spin a little faster.\nOne industrial member of MachH2, Constellation, will use a portion of the hub funding to build the world's largest nuclear-powered clean hydrogen production facility at its LaSalle Clean Energy Center.\nThe project, funded in part through a separate Department of Energy grant, began full production in March 2023. Powered by the LaSalle County Generating Station's two nuclear reactors, the facility will produce an estimated 33,450 tons of clean hydrogen each year.\nCloser to home in Bolingbrook, Hyzon Motors is closing in on a late 2024 production start of its hydrogen fuel cell material plant. The company most recently announced the successful completion and factory acceptance testing of the first nine single-stack, 200-kilowatt fuel-cell system preproduction samples at the plant.\nPat Griffin, Hyzon's North America president, said the 200-kilowatt system is a first in the transportation industry, as the company is transitioning from the more common 110-kilowatt system.\n\"We believe our state-of-the-art facility (in Bolingbrook) will act as an attractor for the hydrogen industry and provide an opportunity for Illinois to be a center for fuel cell technology development,\" Griffin said.\nGriffin added, the clean hydrogen infrastructure to be built through the hub program hugely will support cross-country trucking fleets.\n\"If you think about it, you can travel as far as your fuel onboard will allow. If there aren't fueling stations everywhere you need to go across the country, you start with a back-to-base model,\" he said. \"As you transition to cross country freight, now you have to have fueling stations. This hydrogen economy that is being set up affords the ability to do that.\"\nLooking ahead, the MachH2 alliance alongside the six other selectees will enter award negotiations with the federal government this winter to finalize details and conditions of the award.\n\"We're really, really excited that the Midwest could be and will be viewed as a leader in this transition,\" Banwart said. \"This is a tremendous opportunity for the Midwest in terms of funding, jobs and CO2 reductions.\"\nJenny Whidden, jwhidden@dailyherald.com, is a climate change and environment writer working with the Daily Herald through a partnership with Report For America supported by The Nature Conservancy.

The alliance includes a cross-section of carbon-free energy producers, clean energy developers, hydrogen technology providers, utilities, major manufacturers, national labs and leading hydrogen technology development and deployment institutions, world-class universities, and groups focused on environmental justice.\nEach member shares a commitment to promoting equity and furthering the administration\u2019s Justice40 goals through the development of the hub. The Midwest\u2019s location at the crossroads of America and its strong transportation infrastructure make it ideally suited for supplying clean hydrogen nationwide.\n\ud83d\udd25 What about we co-host a webinar?

Click here to request more details\nHydrogen is the most abundant element in the universe. When made with clean energy, it is an essential resource in meeting our nation\u2019s goal of achieving net zero emissions by 2050. The hub will employ electrolysis technology to separate the hydrogen and oxygen molecules in water.\nAs an energy source, hydrogen does not emit carbon and can be used to reduce emissions from multiple difficult-to-decarbonize sectors of the economy, including aviation, steelmaking, agriculture, and long-haul transportation.\nHydrogen projects already proposed by alliance members will support an estimated 4,500 construction jobs and 400 permanent positions once complete. Total construction spending is estimated at nearly\u00a0$4 billion, including\u00a0$1.7 billion\u00a0in wages and\u00a0$65 million\u00a0to\u00a0$70 million\u00a0in state income taxes.\nThe 400 permanent positions will generate an estimated\u00a0$60 million\u00a0in wages annually \u2014 or roughly\u00a0$900 million\u00a0over the 15-year operating life of the projects \u2013 and an additional\u00a0$35 million\u00a0to\u00a0$40 million\u00a0in state income taxes. More projects may be added as the hub continues to develop, leading to further economic benefits for the region.\nThe alliance is united in a shared vision to create an immediately scalable hydrogen hub in the Midwest that uses the region\u2019s abundant nuclear and renewable power to create a clean hydrogen economy and reduce emissions across multiple heavy emitting sectors.\nThe alliance also is committed to leveraging the clean energy transition to create opportunities in disadvantaged communities through outreach and workforce development initiatives engaging diverse populations.\nIn addition to a cleaner environment and improved air quality, jobs will be created through the development of clean hydrogen infrastructure and related businesses driven by the hub. Engaging communities early in the process of developing hub infrastructure is a key priority for alliance members.\nThe alliance will collaborate on building the clean hydrogen supply, storage infrastructure, distribution networks, technology implementation and regional market necessary to create a sustainable\u00a0hydrogen economy, while also focusing on creating high-quality jobs, improving air quality and benefiting public health and advancing environmental justice. The alliance will submit a concept paper and full hub application in accordance with DOE deadlines.\nJB Pritzker, Illinois\u00a0Governor said:\nThe MachH2 coalition is the result of outstanding effort of numerous public and private partners\u2014including our universities, clean energy developers, transportation companies, manufacturers, and partners in other states\u2014to develop a nation leading clean hydrogen economy in the Midwest.\n\u201cThe\u00a0development of a robust clean hydrogen economy in\u00a0Illinois\u00a0will build on our decarbonization efforts in CEJA, particularly in hard to decarbonize sectors, while creating jobs, spurring infrastructure development throughout\u00a0Illinois, and meeting the environmental justice goals of my administration.\u201d\nGretchen Whitmer, Michigan\u00a0Governor\u00a0said:\nThe Midwest Alliance for Clean Hydrogen is a bold project to reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions from industry and transportation through deployment of clean hydrogen.\n\u201cThrough partnerships with\u00a0Michigan\u00a0partners like the American Center for Mobility, Flint MTA, and the Port of\u00a0Detroit, MachH2 will create good-paying jobs and reduce air pollution and CO2 emissions, helping\u00a0Michigan\u00a0deliver on our\u00a0Healthy Climate Plan goals.\u201d\nDick\u00a0Durbin, U.S. Senator said:\nWe must transition to more sustainable, cleaner fuels and forms of energy if we hope to pass on a livable planet to our kids and grandkids.\n\u201cIn passing the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, I pushed for funding to support the future of a clean energy economy.\u201d\n\u201cWith so many expert\u00a0Illinois\u00a0organizations collaborating on MachH2, I am confident that this Regional Clean Hydrogen Hub proposal will make for a sound investment for the Department of Energy. Hydrogen promises to play a critical role in decarbonizing the transportation sector, and MachH2 demonstrates that\u00a0Illinois\u00a0stands ready to deliver on that promise.\u201d\nTammy Duckworth, U.S. Senator\u00a0said:\nWith Illinois\u2019s robust array of thought leaders, world-class institutions and innovative laboratories, it only makes sense that our great state should be home to the Midwestern Hydrogen hub.\n\u201cIllinois\u2019s\u00a0leadership in clean energy combined with the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law\u2019s clean energy provisions is a recipe for positive change to our energy economy and a better protected environment for years to come.\u201d\nDarin LaHood, Representative\u00a0said:\nIllinois\u00a0is home to a robust nuclear energy sector and is a leader in renewable energy resources.\n\u201cAs our nation navigates growing energy challenges,\u00a0Illinois\u00a0will play a critical role in supporting an all-of-the-above energy approach that restores American energy independence and strengthens our economy.

This historic milestone is part of the third installment of the Investing in America tour, during which President Biden and Secretary Granholm will travel to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania to announce this unprecedented investment in American manufacturing and jobs.\nFunded by President Biden\u2019s Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the seven H2Hubs will kickstart a national network of clean hydrogen producers, consumers, and connective infrastructure while supporting the production, storage, delivery, and end-use of clean hydrogen. The H2Hubs are expected to collectively produce three million metric tons of hydrogen annually, reaching nearly a third of the 2030 U.S. production target and lowering emissions from hard-to-decarbonize industrial sectors that represent 30 percent of total U.S. carbon emissions. Together, they will also reduce 25 million metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from end-uses each year\u2014an amount roughly equivalent to combined annual emissions of 5.5 million gasoline-powered cars\u2014and create and retain tens of thousands of good-paying jobs across the country while supporting healthier communities.\nToday\u2019s announcement is one of the largest investments in clean manufacturing and jobs in history. This transformative Federal investment will be matched by recipients to leverage a total of nearly $50 billion to strengthen local economies, create and maintain high-quality jobs\u2014especially those that support worker organizing and collective bargaining\u2014and slash harmful emissions that jeopardize public health and pollute local ecosystems. In addition to positioning America to be a global leader in emerging clean energy industries, the H2Hubs will implement comprehensive local benefits and workforce proposals to support the President\u2019s vision of an equitable and inclusive clean energy future.\n\u201cUnlocking the full potential of hydrogen\u2014a versatile fuel that can be made from almost any energy resource in virtually every part of the country\u2014is crucial to achieving President Biden\u2019s goal of American industry powered by American clean energy, ensuring less volatility and more affordable energy options for American families and businesses,\u201d said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm. \u201cWith this historic investment, the Biden-Harris Administration is laying the foundation for a new, American-led industry that will propel the global clean energy transition while creating high quality jobs and delivering healthier communities in every pocket of the nation.\u201d\nClean hydrogen is a flexible energy carrier that can be produced from a diverse mix of domestic clean energy resources, including renewables, nuclear, and fossil resources with safe and responsible carbon capture. Its unique characteristics will allow the H2Hubs to substantially reduce harmful emissions from some of the most energy-intensive sectors of the economy, such as chemical and industrial processes and heavy-duty transportation, while creating new economic opportunities across the country. It could also be used as a form of long-duration energy storage to support the expansion of renewable power. By enabling the development of diverse, domestic clean energy pathways across multiple sectors of the economy, clean hydrogen will strengthen American energy independence and accelerate the American manufacturing boom that has already created more than 815,000 jobs since President Biden took office.\nSelected projects for negotiation include:\nLearn more about the seven H2Hubs selected for award negotiations here.\nDOE\u2019s historic $7 billion of Federal investment in clean hydrogen will be met with the H2Hubs selectees\u2019 cost share of more than $40 billion. Together with tax incentives in the President\u2019s historic Inflation Reduction Act and ongoing research and development efforts across the Federal government, today\u2019s announcement will help drive private sector investment in clean hydrogen, setting the nation on a course to hit critical long-term decarbonization objectives.\nDelivering Economic and Environmental Benefits to Communities Across America\nAs part of the President\u2019s commitments to invest in America\u2019s workforce, support high-quality American jobs, advance environmental and energy justice, and strengthen tribal energy sovereignty, each H2Hub was required to develop and ultimately implement a comprehensive Community Benefits Plan (CBP)\u2014which will be informed by early and meaningful community and labor engagements in each region.\nThe Biden-Harris Administration is dedicated to ensuring the benefits of the clean energy transition flow directly to impacted communities\u2014a stark contrast from the legacy of underinvestment and environmental degradation resulting from the development of past energy infrastructure projects. President Biden\u2019s Justice40 Initiative aims to ensure that 40 percent of the overall benefits of certain Federal investments\u2014including from the H2Hubs\u2014positively impact disadvantaged communities that are marginalized by underinvestment and overburdened by pollution.\nThe Administration continues to work in partnership with frontline communities and industries to build a clean energy economy that is equitable and responsive to many of the concerns raised by Environmental Justice communities. As part of those efforts, DOE will co-host virtual community-level briefings for each H2Hub to provide local communities with a forum to learn about and provide input on the selected projects.\nProviding Market Certainty and Unlocking Private Sector Investment\nTo ensure the long-term success of the clean hydrogen economy and support the H2Hubs\u2019 development, DOE issued a Request for Proposals in September 2023 to solicit a U.S. entity to execute a demand-side initiative. This demand-side initiative seeks to ensure that both producers and end users in the H2Hubs have the market certainty they need during the early years of clean hydrogen production to unlock critical private investment.\nDOE\u2019s Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) manages the H2Hubs program and will provide project management oversight for the projects selected to produce clean hydrogen; demonstrate end uses; generate training opportunities and good-paying, high-quality jobs; reduce emissions and pollution; and ensure tangible benefits flow to local Hub communities.\nSelection for award negotiations is not a commitment by DOE to issue an award or provide funding. Before funding is issued, DOE and the applicants will undergo a negotiation process, and DOE may cancel negotiations and rescind the selection for any reason during that time.\nLearn more about how OCED, the U.S. National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap, and the Hydrogen Interagency Task Force are supporting the Biden-Harris Administration\u2019s all-of-government approach to address the climate crisis and deliver a clean and equitable energy future for every American.\n###\nMedia Inquiries:\n(202) 586-4940 or DOENews@hq.doe.gov\nRead more at theenergy.gov Newsroom\n1000 Independence Ave. SW\nWashington DC 20585\n202-586-5000"
