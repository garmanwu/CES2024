        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Integration of AI and IoT drives a need for edge capabilities\nThe overarching themes of acceleration and the technological convergence of IoT and AI are pushing value-propositions in B2C user experience, and problem-solving in B2B vertical market niches. Interestingly, at the same time as IoT and AI technologies converge the geopolitics of nation-states is trending towards a divergence in componentry manufacturing. At the uneasy nexus of these tensions are various regulatory movements, especially around AI.\nOn the one hand, user design considerations in B2C are pushing \u2018core\u2019 IoT concepts like low-power consumption and connectivity further backstage. On the other hand, independent software vendors (ISVs) driving go-to-market campaigns and bringing consumer-style ease of use to enterprises are aligning with innovative channel players offering vertical-specific expertise to reawaken IoT at the edge.\nAI developments enhancing IoT Edge capabilities\nAt CES, the promise of cloud independent AI edge processing included an announcement by Ambient Scientific, specializing in AI processor semi-conductors with offices in Santa Clara, CA with its first AI System on Chip (SoC) GPX10 for portable, battery-powered devices. The GPX10 is manufactured using TSMC\u2019s 40 nm technology with, says Satish Kutty M. Head of Strategy and Business Development, an innovative blend of analog and digital computing. \u201cEssentially what an ARM processor achieves in 32K cycles, we do in one cycle thanks to analog matrix multiplication,\u201d said Saharsh Singhania, Vice President of Product Marketing at Ambient Scientific. Such optimizations often include architectural enhancements such as moving compute nearer to memory on the chip.\nA comparable newer firm, Aspinity, in Pittsburgh, PA, is also working to optimize low-power AI chip edge capabilities. Examples of a uses case for the Aspinity ultra-low power chip could include powering sensors in automobiles when they are not running. Of note, in March 2023, Aspinity announced the integration of its AML Application Board with Renesas\u2019s Quick-Connect IoT Platform highlighting the ultra-low power profile. In parallel news, Olivier Pauzet, Executive VP of Marketing and Strategy with Sequans said that the acquisition of the 5G/4G cellular IoT chips and modules maker by semiconductor supplier Renesas is moving to finalization in the next few weeks. In a broader sense, the merger places Tokyo-based Renesas at a nexus of IoT connectivity and microprocessor capability and with a neutral location during a period of geopolitical concerns over microprocessor and IoT infrastructure componentry.\nAnother newer AI chip firm, Enchargeai.com, founded by Naveen Verma, a professor of electrical and computer engineering at Princeton University, is also oriented towards low power requirements in industrial IoT and other applications. Verma noted analog compute is more powerful and efficient than digital but \u201call approaches to analog compute thus far have been noisy.\u201d Verma described his firm\u2019s innovation for analog in-memory computing as \u201crather than variation-prone semiconductor devices (like transistors, RRAM, MRAM, FLASH), it uses integrated capacitors, that only depend on geometry,\u201d which can be controlled well using advanced Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) manufacturing.\nIoT grows in volume while fading into woodwork\nIn B2C markets, core IoT technologies were pushed backstage as evidenced by Amazon\u2019s presence at The Venetian during CES 2024. There, automated living rooms and kitchens were laid out Ikea showroom style with nary a sensor in sight. Moreover, at CES Amazon announced the broadening of Matter Casting as a non-proprietary home networking standard to support content from iOS and Android devices. In short, the users\u2019 experience is spotlighted with technology fading further behind the curtain. As such, design thinking results in making the technology of IoT invisible.\nIoT technologies spread far beyond the confines of the IoT Infrastructure section of the CES North Hall of the Las Vegas Convention center. The backstage invisibility of IoT and connectivity in B2B markets wasn\u2019t as stark, but it was palpable. For example, Asaf Gigi, VP of Marketing at global IoT connectivity provider, floLive reiterated the all-in-one ease of experience of its 40 integrated global core networks for enterprise customers.\nIoT \u2018spreads out\u2019 at CES 2024, increasingly offers new design options\nThe spread of IoT capabilities throughout CES 2024 offers a unique snapshot of the maturity of IoT itself. There were specific IoT showroom categories at CES 2024, like \u2018IoT Infrastructure\u2019 but firms with IoT capabilities were spread throughout the event\u2019s showrooms. In fast-moving technology fields like IoT, technological innovations often precede mature value propositions in markets. However, the spread of IoT capabilities throughout as a \u2018layer\u2019 at CES 2024 suggests the gap between IoT technological innovations and actual market adoption of offerings with IoT capabilities is vanishing. As such, with IoT innovation and market value propositions taken as 'givens' new value-creation factors, like design, emerge. For example, at Ambient Photonics, Chris Turkstra, Chief Product Officer, pointed to innovative form factors for keyboards and mice as well new orientations for IoT devices made possible by the firm\u2019s two-sided indoor/low light energy harvesting solar cells.\nIn a similar vein, Wiliot\u2019s energy-harvesting IoT Pixels, said Steve Statler, VP of Marketing, enable sensor inputs for tracking supply chain carbon, temperature, humidity, and the like, at a cost of pennies. Wiliot shipped 100 million postage-stamp sized IoT Pixel devices in 2023, said Statler. The company aims to grow that number, said Statler, but as importantly to accelerate low-power connectivity development standards enabling trillions of connected and intelligent things in food, retail supply chains and other markets. If traction is destiny, the admission of Wiliot\u2019s\nambient IoT Pixels and Visibility Platform to the Sustainability category in TIME\u2019s list of the Best Inventions of 2023 is a solid step.\nIn summary, accelerating innovations in IoT and AI are reshaping user experiences in B2C and problem-solving approaches in B2B vertical markets. In the B2C realm, core IoT capabilities like low-power consumption and connectivity are fading into the woodwork. In some sense, design factors and the capacity to reshape a market vertical, like retail, are taking precedent as the \u2018Wow\u2019-factor of IoT tech innovation recedes. On the B2B front, ISVs are driving consumer-style ease of use in enterprises and aligning with innovative channel players proffering expertise to industry verticals.\nFurther, where IoT spread as a layer at CES, developments in AI processing capabilities pointed to the potential rejuvenation of edge IoT and extension new forms of value creation within vertical markets. Broadly speaking, the integration of AI with IoT is increasing the reach of digital transformation in B2C and B2B. At CES 2024, this integration was prominently featured by the emphasis on user experience, design, and, in the near future, efforts to drive value in vertical markets at the edge as IoT and AI converge.\nAsk a question about our research\nRequest a demo of our products and services"

Users can build their own personalised smart-home suite to create a safe and streamlined living space.\nThe U Home platform is suitable for homeowners looking for an easy and powerful tool to enhance their home security and automation, with cross-ecosystem compatibility and wide-ranging product coverage. It is paired with a purpose-built mobile app that transforms the system into the central command centre for smart-home appliances, giving users the ability to access, control and monitor their devices with a single tap.\nThe app works seamlessly with Ultraloq smart locks and allows users to control U-Tec\u2019s devices, including lights, plugs, switches and cameras. This all-in-one app allows for simultaneous control and synchronisation of multiple devices with a single command, and is compatible with Apple Home, Alexa, Google Home and SmartThings for voice control. There are plans for U Home\u2019s smart devices to support Matter.\nThe devices will be available for purchase in February 2024; Ulticam will be available for purchase in June 2024.\n\u201cAs we transition from standalone smart devices towards interconnected smart systems, we see a future with greater integration of multiple devices that are linked by a central platform,\u201d said Clark Ruan, vice president of U-Tec. \u201cPowered by AI and machine learning, U Home is designed to enable seamless interconnectivity across smart devices, empowering users to create a more comfortable and enjoyable daily life.\u201d\nBoosting safety without compromising convenience, U Home leverages biometric recognition, cloud security and bank-level encryption to strengthen its security features such as real-time monitoring, anomaly detection and data backup, while offering a simplified smart-home experience.\nThe evolution of AI and edge computing are unlocking more possibilities for smart homes and U Home devices respond to the trend by harnessing edge AI technology to automate information delivery, offering convenience and efficiency in a wide array of scenarios.\nSmart-home services that don\u2019t cover all product categories require users to purchase devices from different brands. The devices supported by U Home are all independently developed by U-Tec, and cover five categories with over 20 SKUs, capable of meeting the demands of various scenarios including lighting, security and energy management, ensuring uniformity in design and protocols to allow for easier management.\n\u201cWith U Home, users can seamlessly control lighting with a single command and conveniently switch on or off an entire set of lights,\u201d said Ruan. \u201cArriving home, the system automatically deactivates surveillance, and switches on lights and your humidifier, offering a warm welcome. A connected smart speaker is ready for voice commands, easily turning off all the devices before bed. U Home delivers an exceptional smart-home experience, merging convenience, automation and security.\u201d\nFounded in 2015, U-Tec (www.u-tec.com) is based in Union City, California.\nCategories\n\u00a9Copyright 2024.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "IMC Blog\nHome / IoT Library / IMC Blog / Market Analysis / IoT at CES 2023\nIoT at CES 2023\nExploring the trends of the connected future at the most influential tech event in the world.\nSmart toilets,\u00a0personal flying aircraft\u00a0(looks like an oversized drone),\u00a0yard care robots\u00a0(i.e., autonomous lawn mower + snow blower), augmenting\u00a0VR into driving experience. There was so much to marvel at across the booths of 3000 exhibitors spread over 2.2 million sq. ft of space (220K sq. meters). Crowds were back, exhibit floors were filled with excitement, buzz and all kinds of creative (and sometimes quite weird) new tech.\nIt\u2019s been at least three years since the last time CES was this packed. At CES 2020 in January no one could imagine that within a few short months the whole world would largely shut down for as long as it did. And now, three years later it finally feels like the industry rebounded and bursts with excitement about how technology is making some of our wildest dreams a reality.\nWhile the CES show as a whole grew by about 70% this year relative to last year, IoT Infrastructure Pavilion, run by Keith Kreisher and\u00a0IoT M2M Council\u00a0tripled in size from a year before! Module makers, connectivity providers, IoT device manufacturers, IoT software platforms significantly increased their\u00a0presence\u00a0at this year\u2019s CES. What was refreshing to see is how much emphasis many of them placed on helping simplify IoT deployments and make them financially feasible for a broader number of potential use cases. It\u2019s a theme that often came up during panel discussions and analyst interviews hosted by Keith and his team at the IoT M2M Council booth.\nI used an opportunity offered by Keith and his team and shared my views on the drivers of IoT adoption during the interview on the second day of the show. One driver that I continue recognizing as the most significant in the movement to mass IoT adoption is the digitization of just about every industry \u2014 manufacturing, transportation, retail, healthcare, etc.\nSo many large multinational corporations across a spectrum of industries look at what Uber did to the taxi industry, what Airbnb is doing to the hospitality sector, what Amazon did to retail, and wonder how to adapt to the rapidly emerging technological advancements. Taking a hard look at what it would take to stay competitive over the next 10-20 years requires complete reevaluation of the alignment with the technology trends.\nOn the most basic level IoT is about collecting, analyzing and acting upon the data from all kinds of assets or \u201cthings\u201d. It holds tremendous promise around optimizing operations and generating new monetization opportunities. Therefore it\u2019s an integral part of digital transformation for any business.\nSome notable trends I picked up on by talking to the companies in the IoT Infrastructure Pavilion:\nFor example,\u00a01NCE\u00a0demonstrated their\u00a01NCE OS\u00a0that enables such features as:\nOther MVNO\u2019s who were present, such as\u00a0floLIVE,\u00a0Pod Group\u00a0also demonstrated differentiating\u00a0integration\u00a0and\u00a0security\u00a0capabilities respectively.\n1NCE\u2019s example above for connectivity + integration tools I mentioned above falls into this category. Another good example is\u00a0Blue Wireless\u2019\u00a0bundles that include connectivity + LTE/5G router + professional onsite installation. Yet another fascinating example is Pod Group\u2019s\u00a0smart label\u00a0product that is designed to operate on Pod\u2019s connectivity. It\u2019s slightly thicker than regular paper and contains a tiny battery-powered disposable tracker that can send up to 200 packets with positional and temperature data to the cloud.\nFlespi aligns well with this trend. While we remain focused on an API and other back-end IoT software services, flespi platform is hardware agnostic and is compatible with a very large and growing variety of\u00a0IoT device types. This greatly helps to eliminate complexities around working with IoT hardware from different vendors, that may rely on radically different communication protocols. By replacing low level device-to-server communication with the flexible API-based communication, we help hundreds of IoT solution companies simplify their development and get their solutions to the market significantly faster and cheaper.\n***\nAs usual, attending CES was a source of inspiration and re-energizing for the new year. At flespi we\u2019ve ended 2022 with close to\u00a0600K\u00a0connected devices, having almost doubled our volume over the course of last year. While our core transportation vertical remains strong, micro mobility and assets tracking services built on flespi, are gaining momentum. We are very optimistic about 2023 despite the obviously challenging microeconomic climate globally. We\u2019ve gotten some\u00a0exciting plans\u00a0to keep us busy. We are confident that delivering on those plans will enable us to bring more value to our customers and help drive IoT adoption worldwide.\nWritten by Sergei Leuchanka, VP of Business Development, flespi\nCategories\n\u00a9Copyright 2024.
