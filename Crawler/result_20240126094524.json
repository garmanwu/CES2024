Here\u2019s how it works.\nMSI Prepares QD-OLED Gaming Monitor Lineup for CES 2024\nThe present is QD-OLED\nMSI has announced six QD-OLED monitors \u2014 two curved screen and four flatscreen \u2014 which will be showcased during CES 2024. MSI is better known for its motherboards and graphics cards, but it clearly wants to make an early first impression with its new monitor range two months before the show.\nMSI's two incoming curved 1800R monitors\nMSI will have two curved-screen OLED models \u2014 the 34\"-inch MAG 341CQP QD-OLED and the 49\" MPG 491CQP QD-OLED. Both monitors have a curved radius of 1800mm with 0.03 grey-to-grey response time. Both monitors will have ClearMR 9000 and DisplayHDR True Black 400 certification. As a part of MSI's in-house features, these monitors will use OLED Care 2.0 which promises to minimize the risk of OLED burn-in. The rest are gaming-centric features \u2014 Smart Crosshair, Night Vision AI, Optix Scope and 'MSI Gaming Intelligence.' Both monitors will have HDMI 2.1 ports with full 48 Gbps bandwidth, 120Hz, VRR, and ALLM for console games. These monitors also have a USB Type-C port.\nWhat separates these two curved models are the sizes and a few specifications. The refresh rate on the 34\" model is 175Hz and the 49-inch variant's refresh rate is 144Hz. The MAG 341CQP is a more wallet-friendly option but the MPG 491CQP is a pretty attractive high-end curved monitor with a 32:9 aspect ratio. Comparing specifications on paper, it is comparable to the Samsung 49\" QLED monitor.\nIt is interesting to see MSI's new curved monitor variants using 1800CR as it explained via its blog in 2021 that 1000R has a more natural curve which would help players stay focused while gaming, especially on sims like Microsoft Flight Simulator. But the preference for the curved radius depends on the size of the monitor as well as the distance from its user, their preferences, and their main usage (between gaming and productivity). Curved radius is something curved monitor buyers should look at as it enhances immersion for a better experience. Regardless, it's good to see longer curved monitors.\n2K and 4K QD-OLED 27\" and 32\" monitors\nThere are also two size variants with two sub-variant versions of these flat-screen monitors. Both the 32\" models (MPG 321URX and the MAG 321UPX) have UHD 4K display with up to 240Hz refresh rate. The smaller 27\" variants (MPG 271QRX and the MAG 271QPX QD-OLED) have 360Hz refresh rate but with WQHD 2K monitor resolution. All of these monitors use QD-OLED panels with 0.03 GTG response time.\nPricing of these monitors and other specifications have not yet been revealed at the time of writing.\nThe new future is pretty clear. It is safe to assume other manufacturers will show their QD-OLED monitor level during CES 2024. Alienware did already showcase two of its upcoming curved model displays during Twitchcon 2023. This is good as it is a healthy indication that QD-OLED monitors will become a more mainstream standard with a variety of both mid-range and higher-end options.\nStay on the Cutting Edge\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 First Look: 18-Inch MSI Stealth, Raider, and Titan Laptops Are a Power Trio\nPacking Intel's new Core Ultra and 14th Gen \"Raptor Lake Refresh\" CPUs, and up to Nvidia RTX 4090 GPUs, this fresh array of big-screen laptops looks impressive. We previewed each system ahead of its CES debut.\nI\u2019m one of the consumer PC experts at PCMag, with a particular love for PC gaming. I've played games on my computer for as long as I can remember, which eventually (as it does for many) led me to building and upgrading my own desktop. Through my years here, I've tested and reviewed many, many dozens of laptops and desktops, and I am always happy to recommend a PC for your needs and budget.\nMSI revealed a slew of new gaming and professional laptops at CES 2024, including three 18-inch machines across the Stealth, Raider, and Titan lines.\nThe laptop maker paid us a visit prior to the announcements at CES, where we were able to spend some time with the Stealth 18 AI Studio, the Raider 18, and the Titan 18. In addition to their prodigious screen size, these laptops come packing the latest Intel Core Ultra and 14th Gen \u201cRaptor Lake Refresh\u201d HX processors.\nYou can watch our rundown in the video above, and check out more details below.\nStealth 18 AI Studio: Sleek Power for Creative Pros\nMSI\u2019s Stealth line (we reviewed the MSI Stealth 14 Studio last year) has straddled the line between creative professional use and gaming, and the new 18-inch model will look to achieve both at a high level. As the name suggests, these laptops are always on the thinner and sleeker side. That usually comes with some performance limitations\u2014the thinner the chassis, the less room it has for cooling.\nIn precise terms, it measures 0.9 by 15.7 by 11.4 inches (HWD) and 6.39 pounds. The slim-first idea perhaps makes less sense at 18 inches than smaller sizes, since it's not the most travel-friendly size to begin with. But, at least it\u2019s easier to take with you when needed, even if it will mostly serve as a desktop replacement otherwise. Compared with the other machines we\u2019ll touch on in a moment, I felt it wasn\u2019t too bad to carry around, but still not ideal.\nThe sleek look comes through, though. The simple style and smooth lid fits the concept well, and the chassis isn\u2019t overly adorned in general. The magnesium alloy body feels pleasant in-hand, and needless to say you have plenty of screen real estate to enjoy. The mini LED panel measures 18 inches diagonally, with up to a UHD+ (3,840 by 2,400) resolution.\nComponents are what really pushes a creative professional laptop forward at the end of the day, and the Stealth 18 looks to deliver. MSI has opted for Intel\u2019s Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors here, unlike the 14th Gen chips in the pure gaming systems, which makes sense given the AI readiness.\nCore Ultra processors include an onboard neural processing unit, or NPU, that crunches through local AI workloads without burdening the CPU. The Stealth 18 AI Studio will run up to the Core Ultra 9 tier, as well as up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, for the most serious pro-grade workloads.\nMore use cases for local AI will come, but MSI\u2019s AI Engine is a decent starting point for the type of background assistance it can provide. This will dynamically switch your performance tuning behind the scenes depending on what application you have open\u2014you can see it in action in our preview of MSI\u2019s Prestige laptops. MSI will set the starting price for this stealthy 18-incher at $ 3,299, though availability information for this model isn't yet available.\nRaider 18 HX: One for the Hardcore Gaming Crowd\nMoving into the next power tier here, we have the gaming-focused Raider 18. We last reviewed a 16-inch MSI Raider GE68HX in 2023. The Titan is a step beyond this, which we'll get to next, but even for most enthusiasts, you really need to go this high in the hierarchy.\nA thicker 18-inch machine, this has a top-end power ceiling, but it's not worried much about portability. Even more so than the Stealth 18, this is a desktop-replacement laptop, with a monitor-like display. The panel features a QHD+ (2,560-by-1,600-pixel) resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate, which is a fine fit for high-fps and AAA gaming.\nSet this up on your desk as your main gaming station, and move it into the other room for more casual use as needed. I don't think many frequent trips with this are expected, though it\u2019s not as big as it could be\u2014MSI describes it as an 18-inch screen in a 17-inch chassis, as we\u2019re seeing many manufacturers achieve this with thin bezels\u2014but it still weighs a hefty 7.93 pounds. A front-facing LED bar adds some flair into this mostly stationary beast.\nOn the component front, the Raider 18 goes with Intel\u2019s 14th Gen \u201cRaptor Lake Refresh\u201d processors instead of the Meteor Lake chips, up to the Core i9-14900HX. It, too, maxes out at an RTX 4090, for a 250-watt (W) system total (175W GPU, 75W CPU), though many gamers can be content with an RTX 4070 or RTX 4080. MSI has not yet released price or availability information for this model just yet.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nTitan 18 HX: The Cream of the Crop for Enthusiast Gamers\nThe Raider 18 has most gamers covered for power, but a rare tier of shoppers want (and can afford) the best possible equipment bar none. As such, I don't expect most of you to realistically consider the Titan, with the lowest-cost model at $4,999, but it's impressive nonetheless. The previous Titan behemoth we reviewed packed a 13th Gen Core i9 and an RTX 4090. Most manufacturers sell this type of showcase device that demonstrates the current performance peak, and the specs back that up.\nThe core components top out where the others do (because there\u2019s nowhere further to go), up to the Core i9-14900HX CPU and an RTX 4090 GPU at 175W. Vapor-chamber cooling, a maximum of 128GB of memory, and up to 3TB of SSD storage support this ultimate, technically mobile, desktop replacement.\nThe display is no slouch either, beyond its size: This is a 4K mini LED panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, which MSI says is a world-first combination. That\u2019s a dream panel for many, even if you don\u2019t want to play every game at 4K; some may also prefer a lower resolution and higher refresh rate option. But the mini LED is crisp and super bright, rated at 1,000 nits.\nOther factors that add to the Titan\u2019s premium status include an RGB touchpad and key lighting, a Cherry MX mechanical keyboard, and MSI\u2019s Overboost technology, which allows for the boost to 270W total CPU and GPU system power.\nWhile we know how much the new 18-inch Titan will cost, $4,999 to start, MSI has not revealed when exactly this laptop will be released. We\u2019ll have reviews of these systems as they become available, when we can test these powerful parts ourselves, so check back later this year for fully tested coverage.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

The offering includes laptops with Intel\u2019s hotly anticipated NPU (Neural-processing unit) stacked Intel Core Ultra Processor, which has been especially optimized for sustained AI workloads.\nMSI laptops featuring the Intel Ultra chips will be denoted by the suffix \u2018AI\u2019 after their name this year. As you would expect, the chips will feature in some of the company\u2019s full-power gaming laptops, like the Pulse 16 AI and 17 AI, but won\u2019t just be limited to these rigs. New MSI Cyborg 15 AI and Thin 15 AI laptops will also get Intel Ultra processors, giving mainstream gamers access to the hardware too.\nMSI\u2019s productivity and creator lineups also get an AI upgrade, with the company announcing the new Prestige AI Series of lightweight productivity laptops and a new AI version of the MSI Creator 16 Studio laptop \u2013 both offerings born of the need for creators and workers to better handle the increasing AI demands in an everchanging workplace, says MSI.\nThe new MSI Prestige Series includes Prestige 16, 14 and 13 models, all of which pack Intel\u2019s special Ultra processors, with some models including the top-tier Intel Core Ultra 9 185H processor.\nNew MSI Prestige AI laptops will also feature Intel Ultra processors.\nMSI\nThe new MSI Creator 16 AI Studio laptop won\u2019t just be optimized for AI, however \u2013 it also promises better visuals than its 2023 predecessor, featuring a UHD+ MiniLED display with 120Hz refresh rate. The laptop\u2019s display will also be made in the taller 16:10 aspect ratio, which was highly sought after among creators last year.\nProductivity and creator laptops will also feature freshly rejigged designs in 2024 \u2013 MSI promises they\u2019ll be lighter than previous years, but with longer battery lives. The new Prestige 16 AI, for example, will sport a magnesium alloy body and weigh just 3.3 pounds, but MSI claims its 99.9WHr battery will last a full 19 hours.\nMSI\u2019s 2024 Prestige 13 AI Evo, on the other hand, weighs a miniscule 2.2 pounds but sports a 75WHr battery that MSI claims is 50 percent larger than laptops of the same size by rival manufacturers.\nWhy are Intel\u2019s new Ultra processors ideal for AI processing?\nIntel\u2019s Ultra processors are a new iteration of CPUs in an ever-evolving line of intelligent silicon. CPUs in the series are built on a new Intel 4 processing node and feature dedicated Neutral-processing units (NPUs), especially designed to perform AI tasks faster than previous generation CPUs, and most GPUs.\nThe big benefit here is that the NPU can reduce the processing load on a laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU when processing repetitive AI tasks, thereby allowing these chips to work more efficiently. The integration of ARC graphics in the Core Ultra chip is also said to offer more than double the graphical output per watt compared to previous generations \u2013 which promises a big performance boost for light graphical tasks like light gaming.\nBigger more powerful rigs land in 2024\nLaptops with increased power outputs and larger chassis also feature strongly in MSI\u2019s 2024 offering. To be sure, more MSI gaming and creator laptops will get fresh power boosts thanks to Intel 14th Gen mobile HX Series processor upgrades.\nGaming laptops to show off upgraded HX Series silicon include new MSI Vector 16/17 HX models featuring Intel Core i9-14900HX processors, as well as brand new Crosshair 17/16 HX and Sword 17/16 HX models \u2013 which will sport Intel Core i7-14700HX processors.\nIntel\u2019s 14th Gen HX mobile processors may not be especially designed for AI processing, but they\u2019re similarly well optimized for AI purely since they\u2019re extremely fast and have a low task latency. Top tier 14th Gen Intel mobile HX CPUs, for example, can reach a whopping 5.8GHz maximum clock speed. They also come with Intel Application Optimizer for thread optimization in gaming \u2013 so they promise faster and more powerful gaming performance than ever before.\nMSI has announced new MSI Vector and Crosshair laptops featuring 14th Gen Intel HX Series mobile processors. New Pulse models get new Intel Ultra CPUs.\nMSI\nAll of these models will come with Nvidia AI ready RTX 40 Series GPUs \u2013 which include Nvidia\u2019s AI-powered DLSS3 technology and AI Tensor Cores \u2013 and with designs that boast six air vent chambers for heat dissipation. These laptops will also sport impressive power outputs \u2013 the Vector 17 HX, for example, stands out from the bunch; it features MSI Overboost technology for a maximum output of 250W.\nFor those that can\u2019t get enough power or immersive visuals, MSI has also just announced a new 18-inch gaming laptop family at CES 2024. The family includes laptop models carrying MSI Titan HX, MSI Raider HX and MSI Stealth 18 AI Studio brand names.\nAmong this lot, gamers will find models featuring 18-inch 4K,120Hz MiniLED displays with DisplayHDR 1000 and wide color gamuts for brilliant visuals. The Titan HX looks to be the most impressive of the selection \u2013 its top tier configuration will be a beast of a laptop, packing no less than an Intel Core i9-14900HX CPU, 18-inch 4K display, Nvidia RTX 4090 GPU and a whopping 270W power.\nMSI\u2019s new AI Software Suite\nIt\u2019s a no brainer that hardware is only as good as the software that runs off it, which accounts for why MSI has also announced a suite of AI-driven software at CES 2024. Dubbed the \u2018MSI AI Software Suite\u2019 by the company, the collection includes three programs: AI Engine, AI Artist and AI Noise Cancellation. We\u2019ve summarized these below:\nAI Engine \u2013 Automatically optimizes laptop settings such as the display, audio, power profiles and the keyboard backlight based on the application that you\u2019re currently using. It aims to automate a lot of the fiddly background settings adjustment you may have previously had to do. AI Artist \u2013 An offline text-to-image service that eliminates network latency and data leakage. It offers features like image-to-image, image-to-text and the exporting of layered PSD files for Photoshop editing to greatly simplify these processes for creative professionals.AI Noice Cancellation Pro \u2013 An AI-powered noise cancellation software. This software optimizes the use of the laptop\u2019s microphone hardware to improve the quality of audio for meetings or recording sessions.\nMSI has announced MSI AI Suite, a collection of software aimed at utilizing the new AI hardware in the company\u2019s 2024 lineup.\nMSI\nCoupon Codes\nBusiness\nLaptop\nMobile\nPC Hardware\nDeals\nDigital Magazine - Subscribe\nManage Subscription\nGift Subscription\nNewsletters"

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nBest of CES 2024: ZDNET editors' top picks\nThe ZDNET team scoured CES 2024 to find the most innovative new tech and the most exciting new products to share with our audience of professionals and tech enthusiasts. We have lots of lists summing up the best TVs, best laptops, best robots, best headphones, best mobile accessories, and more.\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nAlso: CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nBut we also wanted to give you a list of our absolute top picks from CES that we think will be most worth your hard-earned money when they launch in 2024. And naturally, we also wanted to highlight the best innovations -- products that you may not buy but are worth knowing about because they could influence other products that you may want to bring into your life in the future. So here they are.\nSamsung S95D OLED: Best TV\nTV innovation was everywhere at CES 2024 with transparent TVs, over 100-inch QLEDs, folding TVs, and 8K projectors. But the best TV of the show had a more subtle upgrade that will have a much bigger impact on the quality of the everyday viewing experience. The Samsung S95D OLED TV unveiled a glare-free display that offers the best qualities of anti-reflective screens while maintaining the intense colors and excellent dynamic range that make OLED the top technology for picture quality. We tested the glare-free display with an intense phone camera flash and were amazed at how well it dispersed the light. This means that you can now use this TV in the brightest rooms -- one of the biggest challenges for OLED TVs. I'm confident that will give this the TV with the best picture quality on the market when it launches this spring. It will likely cost around $2,500, until it gets discounted around Black Friday.\nSamsung S95D\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid: Best laptop\nWe've tested and seen plenty of 2-in-1 computers at ZDNET, but there's none quite like Lenovo's new ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid. That's because this is the world's first 2-in-1 Windows PC and Android tablet, meaning as you detach the 14-inch OLED display from the keyboard, the device automatically converts into the Android operating system. On top of that, you can still connect the bottom keyboard portion of the 2-in-1 to an external monitor, giving you, essentially, two computers to work with.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nTimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub: Best AI device\nIn the past year, we have seen major leaps in the AI space, which led to a boom in translation technology at CES. The TimeKettle X1 made delivers real-time translations in up to 40 languages, with nearly no latency and high accuracy, which I got the chance to experience myself. The device itself fits in the palm of your and includes a screen that displays transcriptions of your conversation and two earbuds that two people can wear for real-time in-ear translations during a one-on-one conversation. There are a series of modes, making it ideal for every situation you may need a translation. If you sync different hubs, it can provide real-time translations for up to 20 people in five different languages, aimed for use in classrooms and meetings. The product is already available for $699 on the TimeKettle website.\nTimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub\nMSI Claw: Best gaming device\nIn what is becoming one of the hottest product categories in recent years, the Taiwanese computer maker's first gaming handheld impresses with the latest Intel Core Ultra processor for AI enhancements to performance and gaming, a more ergonomic design (with plenty of ventilation) than its competition, and USB-C Thunderbolt support for external monitor use. The LCD display falls short to its OLED rivals, but the gaming potential of this handheld should more than compensate for it. It will start at $699 and arrive later this year.\nMSI Claw\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar: Best tech accessory\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar offers the same types of insights a fitness tracker for humans would. You place the attachment on your dog's collar and on the app you will have access to data about your dog's heart health, activity, appetite, and more. The attachment can also track your dog's location, eliminating the need for additional trackers such as AirTags. One of the most important features is its ability to detect early symptoms of heart disease, potentially saving your dog's life. The Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category since it is through AI that the collar can detect your dog's activities, such as sleeping, walking, and more. The Minitailz Smart Dog Collar is already available for $99, and it requires a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar\nHoloconnect Holobox: Best innovation overall\nThe Holoconnect Holobox makes it possible to talk to someone via a hologram with near-zero latency. It's a \"plug and play\" system, so all you need to do is plug it in and connect it to the internet to get started. To be a hologram yourself, you need a white background that is well-lit, and then you can carry on like it is a regular video call. It is already available for consumer use, and we even saw Google use the Holobox to showcase its Android characters in fun and innovative ways at CES 2024. The price is not disclosed on the Holoconnect website, but interested customers can request a pricing list. It's very expensive and most people aren't going to want to put this phone booth sized box in their living room, but the idea of video calls of the future becoming holograms is super compelling.\nHoloconnect Holobox\nTCL 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV: Best TV innovation\nThe recent trend in Laser TV and ultra short throw (UST) projectors has spawned a wave of interest in 100-inch and 120-inch screens to create a more cinema-like experience at home. At CES, Samsung even unveiled an 8K projector that goes up to 150 inches. The challenge with these projectors is that they're never going to have the same level of dynamic range, brightness, or color intensity as today's best OLED and QLED TVs. TCL had an answer to that at CES with the announcement of its 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV. We were highly impressed with the picture quality of this QLED display in a private demo. It's an extension of TCL's QM8 series, which ZDNET and others have rated as one of the best TVs on the market. The TCL 115QM891G (the official product name) kicks it up a notch with 5,000 nits of brightness and 20,000 local dimming zones to drive excellent dynamic range and sharp colors. Pricing wasn't announced but it will likely cost around $20,000 and it will be available at Best Buy. That makes it an ultra-premium purchase, but if you have the space and the budget then you can now get a projector-level screen size with the benefits of the latest advances in QLED picture quality.\nTCL 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV\nRabbit: Best AI innovation\nWhat if AI assistants could do more than just give you the best search results and leave you to do the rest? What if they could book an Airbnb for you, shop for groceries online and checkout, or start a return for that impulsive Black Friday purchase? That's what the folks at Rabbit are touting with R1, its new $199 pocket device that operates on a \"Large Action Model\". Made in partnership with Teenage Engineering, the R1 may be the first of many AI hardware releases in 2024. The ball is now in the court of the world's biggest tech giants to deliver superior voice assistant experiences to match the capabilities of what Rabbit has come up with.\nRabbit R1\nSony XR headset: Best VR/AR innovation\nSony gave us the biggest shocker of CES 2024 in the opening keynote of the show when it partnered with Siemens to unveil an XR headset with high-end specs and an attractive Sony design. While this headset has the oomph to compete with Apple Vision Pro, it's not aimed at a general consumer audience but is focused directly on professionals, engineers, and designers to help them accelerate product development and create spatial content experiences that could ultimately run on Vision Pro, Meta Quest, and other headsets and smart glasses. This product will have the potential to save a lot of time and resources for companies in flying people around the globe or shipping prototypes to collaborate on and finalize their products. They'll do this by creating \"digital twins\" in virtual spaces such as Siemens NX Immersive Designer. Sony won't sell the headset as a standalone device, but it will be bundled with Siemens' platform and other software packages for specific industries. That will include an entertainment industry bundle that Sony wants to use to empower the next generation of digital storytellers to build immersive 3D experiences.\nSony XR headset\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES 2024 Day 2: The 8 announcements that intrigued us most\nThe best smart home tech at CES 2024"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: Evolution and Revolution\nThough AI was a popular buzzword, faster and better designed products dominated\nCES, the world\u2019s leading trade show, is back! Yes, there were in-person versions of the show in 2022 and 2023, but this year is the first since 2020 that felt \u201cnormal.\u201d The halls were crowded full of eager attendees, the show floors were packed with booths and most of the companies we usually visit with at CES had a presence.\nGoing into the show, we expected to hear the word \u201cAI\u201d every five seconds that we talked with vendors, but in the enthusiast tech world, we heard it a bit less often than our colleagues who cover TVs, appliances and phones at other websites. Instead, it seems that nothing beats good design, more processing power and a positive user experience.\nIntel and the laptop vendors which use its CPUs showed off various local AI workloads, which mostly involved generating images or managing power profiles And AI underpins Nvidia\u2019s gaming technologies. But there are only so many times we can prompt Stable Diffusion\u2019s GIMP plugin to draw a cat driving a car, before we get bored. MSI is the one company that wowed us with a true AI innovation: a monitor that uses computer vision to analyze your game\u2019s map and point out where enemies are coming from.\nInsead, we were excited to see a number of products that really moved the ball forward in ways that were more evolutionary than revolutionary: new graphics cards and CPUs \u00a0that add more performance for the money, a high-end 3D printer that zooms along at 600 mm/s and works with carbon fiber or a gorgeous OLED monitor that can run at up to 480 Hz at 1080p or 240 Hz at 4K.\nThese are the 15 best products of CES 2024.\nBest Graphics Card: Nvidia RTX 4070 Super\nNvidia announced three new RTX 40-series Super model graphics cards, and AMD revealed its RX 7600 XT 16GB. While all four will vie for a spot on our list of the best graphics cards for gaming (and other uses), the one we're most excited about is\u2026 well, honestly it's a bit hard to nail things down. Nvidia provides more performance for a lower price than its existing non-Super cards, so things definitely moved in the right direction. AMD provides double the VRAM and slightly higher performance with its new GPU, at a higher price than the RX 7600. But none of the new models are all that surprising \u2014 we've been hearing rumors about both for several months at least. Still, if we have to just pick one for an award, it's the new RTX 4070 Super.\nFundamentally, you're getting about 93% of the RTX 4070 Ti, for 75% of the price. Alternatively, you're getting 22% more GPU than the RTX 4070 for the same price. More importantly, you're at least getting 12GB of high-speed GDDR6X memory, along with access to Nvidia's RTX technologies: DLSS, superior ray tracing, and AI tensor cores. Given the RTX 4070 already trades blows with the RX 7800 XT \u2014 slightly slower rasterization performance, much faster ray tracing and AI performance, and the RTX 4070 Ti does the same with the RX 7900 XT \u2014 Nvidia now effectively delivers a higher performance option at the same price.\nThe RTX 4070 Super launches next week, so check back then for our full review and benchmarks.\nRead more: Nvidia RTX 40-series Super models revealed\n\u2014Jarred Walton\nBest CPU: Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 8600G\nAMD rolled out its Ryzen 8000G \u2018Phoenix\u2019 lineup of APUs at CES 2024, beating Intel to the punch as the first company to bring purpose-built AI accelerators to the desktop PC -- its second such feat after it was the first to bring AI to laptops with the same XDNA-powered neural processing unit (NPU). The chips also boast a powerful integrated RDNA 3 graphics engine that AMD claims delivers 1080p-capable gaming performance, even in some AAA titles, albeit at the reduced fidelity settings we\u2019d expect from this class of chip.\nAs we\u2019ve seen in the past, AMD builds its APUs for the desktop using the same silicon as its laptop chips. In this case, AMD leverages the Phoenix architecture that employs the Zen 4 CPU architecture and RDNA 3 graphics engine. However, the lack of battery life concerns in desktop PCs allows the chip to run at higher power limits, thus unleashing the full power of the silicon. AMD\u2019s two flagship models, the Ryzen 7 8700G and the Ryzen 5 8600G, boast eight and six cores, respectively. AMD also brought its new APU lineup up to modern standards with support for AM5\u2019s DDR5 and PCIe 4.0 connectivity, crafting what should be exceptionally powerful processors given their accessible price point.\nAMD\u2019s APUs have historically dominated the entry-level gaming market because Intel doesn\u2019t have processors with powerful enough integrated graphics to provide meaningful gaming performance, even for the lowest-end gaming systems. AMD\u2019s previous-gen Ryzen 5 5600G has long been one of the \u00a0Best CPUs for gaming \u00a0due to its surprisingly strong graphics performance, and we expect the new models to assume that mantle once again.\nThe chips feature FSR, HYPR-RX, and Fluid Motion Frames support, competitive pricing, and bundled coolers for all three SKUs. The new Ryzen APU models are poised to dominate the entry-level gaming segment once again when they arrive on January 31, winning our pick for the best CPU of CES 2024.\nRead more: AMD launches Ryzen 8000G \u2018Phoenix\u2019 APUs, brings AI to the desktop PC\n-Paul Alcorn\nBest Gaming Monitor: Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP\nWhen it comes to the best gaming monitors, you often must make some hard choices regarding performance and maximum image quality. You can go with an IPS panel and get ultra-fast 500 Hz refresh rates but compromise on contrast and color. Or you can opt for an OLED panel, which offers vibrant colors and inky blacks but falls short of class-leading refresh rate performance.\nFortunately, Asus is coming to the rescue with its ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP gaming monitor, hoping to give gamers the best of both worlds. In its standard operating mode, the PG32UCDP seems like any other modern high-end 32-inch gaming monitor with a brilliant OLED panel, a 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution, a fast 240Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1,300 nits. There\u2019s enough resolution for productivity tasks when not gaming and plenty of performance overhead for 4K gaming with the best graphics cards.\nHowever, the real spicy action happens when you switch to Frame Rate Boost mode. Gamers can quickly toggle this setting on the monitor, which drops the resolution down to Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution and boosts the maximum refresh rate to 480 Hz. That next-level speed and performance put it on even footing with the Alienware AW2524H and AW2524HF, which have a native refresh rate of 480 Hz at Full HD resolution. However, those fraternal Alienware twins can hit 500Hz with an overlock setting in the OSD.\nStill, the ability for gamers to pick and choose when they want maximum resolution or maximum performance, all while maintaining the image quality advantages of OLED, must be commended. Asus also gets the basics right, with HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 connectivity, 90-watt USB-C Power Delivery, and an integrated KVM switch.\nWe\u2019ll be curious to see how the Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP performs once we get it in the lab.\nRead more: Asus announces two new OLED gaming monitors delivering 480 Hz at up to 1440p resolution\n--Brandon Hill\nBest Memory: Micron LPCAMM2\nMicron unveiled its new LPCAMM2 memory modules at CES 2024. Despite earlier announcements from competing companies, Micron will be the first to actually bring memory modules based on the new standard to market. Perhaps more important for those looking for the ultimate in performance, these new modules unlock speeds of 9,600 MT/s via LPDDR5X memory, a massive increase over the standard SODIMM peak of DDR5-6400. However, that\u2019s just one of the many advantages of this new memory form factor that will become common in performance-oriented laptops over the coming years.\nThe LPCAMM2 standard also promises to bring fast and power-efficient LPDDR5X memory to laptops in a removable form factor for the first time, meaning the memory chips are no longer required to be soldered directly to the motherboard. These new modules will replace the standard SODIMMs that dominate current laptops, but the innovative design consumes 80% less power and 64% less space inside the chassis, thus enabling longer battery life and even slimmer laptop designs. LPCAMM2 also provides a dual-channel memory interface from a single module, a first. The modules will come in 16, 32, and 64GB capacities at first, with room to grow up to 128GB of capacity in a single module in the future.\nThe power and space savings, not to mention the speed improvements, of Micron\u2019s LPCAMM2 are set to redefine our expectations for laptop memory, earning our award for the best memory of CES 2024.\nRead more: Micron displays next-gen LPCAMM2 modules for laptops at CES 2024\n\u2013Paul Alcorn\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14/G16\nAsus took classic, beloved laptops known for performance, portability, and even battery life, and made them sleeker than ever. The new Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16 are slimmer and have newer, more adult designs than before, and, well, it looks great. There's only so much you can do without a new GPU to push forward graphics, so Asus dug into the design.\nFor the G14, that does mean topping out at an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 and AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS, while the G16 uses up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and RTX 4090. Both have silver and black options with a stripe on the lid, rather than a garish massive ROG logo or AniMe Matrix. I'm not going to say it looks like it could double as a business laptop, but it's far more attractive.\nThey're also getting, on paper, really nice screens, with Asus' OLED Nebula displays. The 14-incher gets a 2880 x 1800 screen at 120 Hz, while the bigger 16-inch laptop goes to 2560 x 1600 at 240 Hz. In a brief trial, both looked great, and we're excited to see just how well they perform in real testing.\nRead more: Asus ROG Zephyrus gets a sleek, slim new look with AMD Hawk Point and Intel Core Ultra\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Laptop: Asus Zenbook Duo\nThis was a contentious category among the Tom's Hardware judges, with some favoring the HP Spectre x360 2-in-1's even approach to a refresh without reinventing the wheel, while others like the very-CES approach of the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid and its ability to run both Windows and Android with a tablet and base station. But the Asus Zenbook Duo kept coming up as an option that seemed like a refined idea at a price point that's not crazy.\nThe Zenbook Duo has a pair of 14-inch OLED displays and a detachable Bluetooth keyboard. It's an idea we first saw hit production in Lenovo's Yoga Book 9i, but that one had a U-series CPU and an origami kickstand that wasn't intuitive. Asus' Zenbook Duo's kickstand is permanently attached to the laptop, and it goes up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H. So it should be easier to use and more powerful. The Asus model has far more ports than the Yoga, including HDMI alongside two Thunderbolt 4 ports.\nWhile we don't have a final price for it, it's been suggested to us that it will hover around $1,500. If that sticks, it won't be a ridiculous price, considering the Yoga was almost $2,000 when we reviewed it.\nI did have a bit of trouble getting the early unit at Asus' briefing to stand up straight with the monitors side to side, but otherwise it seemed like a solid machine, and we're eager to see what it can do.\nRead more: Asus Zenbook Duo is a dual-screen foldable with two 14-inch OLED screens and Intel Core Ultra\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Gaming Handheld: MSI Claw\nOne way to make a splash at CES is to be the first to do something. And while the MSI Claw isn't the first modern handheld gaming PC, it is the first mainstream PC brand to use Intel Core Ultra processors (or Intel at all. Lenovo, Asus, and Valve all opted for AMD chips). It's also packing a bigger battery than other handhelds, even if MSI isn't exactly claiming record-breaking battery life.\nMSi is claiming that it's producing a more ergonomic device, and while the plastic did divide some of our editors on the show floor, we're looking forward to trying it in long-term use. The screen seems similar to the one on the Asus ROG Ally, but considering that was a pretty decent screen, it's hard to argue with.\nIntel improving in graphics means we get more competition in handheld gaming outside of the Kickstarter space. We're looking forward to seeing how Intel and MSI put their own mark on it with MSI Center M, XeSS, and other technologies.\nRead more: MSI Claw is the first gaming handheld to run on an Intel Core Ultra processor with Arc Graphics\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Cooling / DIY: Hyte Nexus Link\nIt\u2019s not easy to get excited about an ecosystem at a show like CES, but Hyte\u2019s Nexus Link was a standout for me.This cable-decluttering and system-building simplification platform is clearly a competitor to Corsair's iCue Link, with similar daisy-chained magnetic connectors and fans. But Hyte also offers magnetic RGB strips that use the same connector, and the products have a quirky but much more interesting design.\nNexus Link is powered by a quad-core Arm CPU housed in the screen built into the company\u2019s Thicc Q60 AIO cooler, which we first saw at Computex last year. It sports a thick 240mm radiator and chunky fans that the company claims will outperform any 360mm radiator currently on the market. So the importance of performance isn\u2019t getting left behind in the quest for clean design.\nIn my brief hands-on time with it, the whole Nexus Link ecosystem, from the hardware to the software, felt more refined, definitely more visually interesting, and arguably better built than what Corsair has done with iCue Link. That's a little shocking from a company so comparatively new and unknown.\nI will wait for the chance to build a Nexus Link system and spend some time with the software before I can say for sure how it compares to the competition from Corsair and Lian Li, and others. But on first impression, Hyte looks to be on the verge of pulling off a major upset in the DIY PC space.\nRead more: Hyte's Nexus Link ecosystem of RGB devices makes building rainbow PCs seem easier than ever\n\u2013Matt Safford\nBest PC Case: MSI MEG Maestro 700L PG\nWe saw quite a few PC cases designed to support motherboards with rear-facing connectors here at CES 2024, and MSI\u2019s Project Zero boards are some of the first to market using Maingear\u2019s patent. But most are fairly compact, and don\u2019t support full-size ATX options. MSI\u2019s large MEG Maestro 700L PG, though, supports up to E-ATX boards \u2013 like most of these cases, it will work with traditional motherboards as well). But the 700L PG takes the en vogue \u201cfishbowl\u201d case style to the next level, with the entire front and side panel made up of one massive curved piece of tempered glass.\nThe rest of the case is crafted from large panels of 2.5 mm-thick aluminum, and the dual-panel design hides the PSU behind the motherboard, along with all the wires and connectors. Don\u2019t worry about airflow, because fans or large radiators can be mounted in front of the motherboard, as well as on the top or bottom of the case.\nAs you might expect, this will be an expensive case, with an MSI rep telling us that it will cost around $400 when it arrives sometime in the next month or so. It\u2019s far from cheap, but if you crave that clean interior look with acres of glass to show off your GPU and other components, MSI\u2019s MEG Maestro 700L PG is arguably the prettiest of these kinds of cases we\u2019ve seen yet. But at the same time, just looking at that large bent piece of glass makes us more than a little nervous.\n\u2013Matt Safford\nBest Mouse: Mad Catz MMO 7+\nIt's been a while since we've seen Mad Catz \u2014 the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and then quietly revived under new ownership in 2018, but it hasn't exactly been making waves. But the brand is back at CES this year with a slew of gaming peripherals, including a new wireless version of an old classic: the MMO 7.\nThe new MMO 7+ is a wireless version of Mad Catz' classic MMO-focused multi-button mouse, with some improvements that bring it into 2024. It features a whopping 21 programmable buttons with a shift mode and five profiles for up to 210 inputs (okay, that's a little ambitious \u2014 but still, 21 buttons is pretty impressive). What's nice is that those 21 buttons are not just laid out in a 12-button side panel like most MMO mice have (see: Razer's Naga V2 Pro, Corsair's Scimitar Elite Wireless, etc), but are kind of... all over the mouse, which makes them easier to differentiate. Like the old MMO 7, it's modular and will come packaged with interchangeable palm rests and pinky rests, as well as a tool that will let you change the palm and thumb rest positions.\nAside from wireless connectivity (2.4GHz and Bluetooth) and a USB-C charging port, the MMO 7+ also features a Pixart PAW-3395 optical sensor, which has a maximum sensitivity of 26,000DPI, a maximum speed of 650 IPS, and up to 50 G's of acceleration, as well as customizable RGB lighting and a horizontal scroll wheel. The only real disappointment is battery life, which is currently rated at 40 hours \u2014 most gaming mice these days are hitting 75 - 120 hours, so that's a pretty big difference. Still, it's nice to see a mouse that's not just a stripped-down, ultra-lightweight, FPS-oriented pointer with the promise of unnecessarily high polling rates.\n\u2014 Sarah Jacobsson Purewal\nBest Keyboard: Cooler Master MK770\nWe've seen a lot of keyboards at CES 2024, and we actually saw this keyboard \u2014 or, well, the prototype of it \u2014 at CES 2023. But while we've seen a lot of gaming companies making keyboards to appeal to both gamers and keyboard enthusiasts, we haven't seen a lot of them also taking budget into account. Cooler Master's MK770 has all the premium features we've been looking for \u2014 gasket-mounted, hot-swappable, wireless with tri-mode connectivity, double-shot PBT keycaps, and more than one colorway \u2014 and it's set to cost just $119 when it launches this year.\nThe MK770 is also a 96-percent keyboard, meaning it's practically full-sized (minus some navigation keys) while still being relatively compact (or, well, as compact as you can get without sacrificing your number pad). It features a solid-feeling chassis with two sets of flip-out feet on the bottom \u2014 and cleverly-placed dongle storage under one of the flip-out feet, and has a programmable clickable volume knob. It's not the most feature-rich keyboard, but it's got everything you need for wireless gaming and it's hot-swappable.\n\u2014 Sarah Jacobsson Purewal\nBest Innovation: MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED\nBigger, faster, more colorful. Those are three aspects that we typically track when new monitors are announced. For example, ASRock is making waves with its new 27-inch 520Hz gaming monitor, and vibrant OLED monitors are becoming more commonplace. But what if a company could make a monitor smarter? That's not something we'd thought about until now, with the introduction of the MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED and its onboard AI acceleratoOne feature of the AI hardware, dubbed SkySight, can automatically pinpoint and mark enemies on the screen in games like League of Legends. Instantly knowing what direction your enemies are coming from \u00a0is a definite perk, even if you could do the tracking with your own eyes.\nAll the AI processing is performed onboard the monitor and is undetectable since there is no intervention from your operating system or other installed software. We could see this being frowned upon by competitive gamers as an unfair advantage, but the underlying technology that frames SkySight is intriguing.\nThe MEG 321URX even features what MSI calls a Spectrum Bar (basically, a thin RGB strip) that sits below the display. Once again, using League of Legends as an example, the Spectrum Bar can light up to mirror your character's current health status. Even though League of Legends was the primary focus of MSI's CES demos, the company plans to release software for training to detect on-screen items for just about any game. It would be cool to see the Spectrum Bar used to mimic shift lights that you would see on a steering wheel on an F1 driver's steering wheel in games like EA's F1 23.\nLooking past the AI intrigue, the MEG 321URX's specs sheet is impressive in its own right, with a 32-inch 4K QD-OLED panel. The monitor can even achieve 240Hz at that native resolution with a 0.03ms response time. It also features a USB-C port with 90-watt power delivery, HDMI 2.1, and DisplayPort 1.4 support.\nKeep an eye out for the MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED when it debuts this spring.\nRead more: MSI's AI-powered gaming monitor helps you cheat at 'League of Legends,' looks great doing it\n--Brandon Hill\nBest 3D Printer: Creality K1C\nCreality\u2019s flagship K1 printer was already excellent, providing high-quality output at speeds as high as 600 mm/s. However, the K1 isn\u2019t perfect and there are a few things that Creality fans had wanted from it, including the ability to sustain higher temperatures and work with more exotic filaments.\nEnter the Creality K1C, which takes everything we like about the K1 and builds upon it. The new printer features an all-metal hotend which allows it to operate at a steady 300 degrees and therefore work with carbon fiber (that\u2019s what the C in K1C is for). The printer also has a revised bowden tube path, better build plate and other improvements we don\u2019t know about yet (the company has not released full specs). One of the leading 3D printer companies has a new leading device.\nRead more: Creality unveils new flagship K1C 3D printer and latest Ender 3 V3 model\n\u2013 Avram Piltch\nBest SSD: Phison PCIe 5.0 powered drives and controllers\nPhison previewed its E26 Max14um firmware prior to CES, and we saw multiple drives that should soon hit retail with performance of up to 14 GB/s. The key to enablement of the Micron 2400 MT/s NAND involved firmware updates and tuning to keep the controller within the PCIe M.2 power limit. Which brings us to the second part of this award.\nThe Phison E26 controller has been powering the fastest PCIe 5.0 drives of the past year, but the real innovation is set to arrive with the next generation E31 controller that will launch later this year. E26 is manufactured on TSMC's 12nm process, and the E31 will move to TSMC 7nm (N7). At that point, the combination of NAND and controller should effectively max out what we can expect to see from PCIe 5.0 drives \u2014 we'll need PCIe 6.0 to get significantly faster.\nPut another way, Phison is moving the entire high-performance consumer SSD market forward. Without Phison, we'd still be stuck with PCIe 4.0 drives for at least a few more months. We've had PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots on Z690 motherboards since 2021 and had to wait two years to get SSDs that would make use of the technology, and we have Phison to thank for that.\n\u2013 Jarred Walton\nBest Motherboard: ASRock Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning Wi-Fi\nASRock already owns most of the slots on our Best Motherboards page for current-gen chipsets, because the company has recently been delivering solid feature sets at comparatively low prices, while the rest of the industry seems content to churn out ever-more-expensive boards for the kinds of builders who still have $1,000 or more left over after buying the shiny new RTX 4080 Super.\nAnd the new Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning Wi-Fi, at just $200, looks to continue that trend for those looking to build a compact but powerful Mini-ITX with up to an Intel 14900K, thanks to 14+1+1 power phase setup, adorned with some chunky heatsinks.\nThe dual-DIMM setup that\u2019s typical of ITX boards should also make for top-speed RAM support. The only limiting factor here is that the board seems to only have a single PCIe 4.0 M.2 slot, although there could be another hiding on the back of the board. We hope to get this board in soon and run it through our benchmark suite. If it performs as expected, this will likely be an appealing motherboard for many gamers looking to build a powerful compact rig while spending most of their build budget on things like the GPU and CPU.\nRead More: ASRock's $200 Mini-ITX motherboard to support Intel Core i9-14900K\n\u2013 Matt Safford\nStay on the Cutting Edge\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.
