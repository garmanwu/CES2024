Here are the thoughts of our seasoned test system expert Timo Vallgren, Team Manager, Test system development. This post is a part of our #testertuesday series, where Timo explains the intricacies of test system implementation.\nTest Strategy: Driving Quality in Product Manufacturing\nAre test strategies just an additional burden or a crucial step towards ensuring product quality? In my opinion, they are especially crucial when dealing with multiple PCBA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s or assembled products. And when your manufacturing is spread across different locations, having a clear understanding of what needs to be done and where becomes paramount.\u00c2\nOne key aspect of test strategy is test data management. This plays a vital role in multi-site scenarios, allowing us to track whether a product has passed the required tests or not. It helps us maintain a comprehensive record of our testing outcomes.\nWhile the term \"strategy\" might sound overwhelming, it's important to note that it doesn't entail reinventing the wheel for each new product. Once the test strategy for the first product is crystal clear, it can often serve as a blueprint for subsequent products with minimal adjustments.\u00c2\nSo, what exactly do we mean by test strategy? In simple terms, it describes the necessary testing procedures that ensure the manufacturing of a high-quality product.\nAt Etteplan, we understand that having a robust test strategy is essential for delivering reliable and top-notch products to our customers. By prioritizing this aspect of our manufacturing process, we aim to drive meaningful progress and bring lasting change across various sectors.\nLet's embrace the power of well-defined test strategies to build sophisticated and approachable products while challenging the status quo. Together, let's pave the way towards excellence in quality assurance.\nLearn how Etteplan can support you with production testing:\u00c2\u00a0https://lnkd.in/dmB3tDt6\n\u00c2\n#testertuesday\u00c2\u00a0##TestStrategy\u00c2\u00a0#TestSystem\u00c2\u00a0#productiontester\u00c2\u00a0#productionsolutions\u00c2\u00a0#automation\u00c2\u00a0#industrialautomation\u00c2\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n32,164 followers\nWhen we talk to prospective clients, we often hear about the problem with the correct delivery of spare parts.

Here are the thoughts of our seasoned test system expert Timo Vallgren, Team Manager, Test system development. This post is a part of our #testertuesday series, where Timo explains the intricacies of test system implementation.\nAs experts in the field, we understand that a well-written test specification is crucial when it comes to creating a comprehensive Test System quotation. Quality and clarity are key factors that can make or break the effectiveness of this document. Today, let's dive into some insights on how to craft impactful test specifications and why they matter.\nWhen approaching test specifications, think of them as your opportunity to communicate with someone who has zero understanding of your product - because essentially, that's what it is. While there may be similarities with other products, the way your features are implemented makes your application unique.\nA great starting point is to create clear test headers that serve as a skeleton for your specification. However, it's important to remember that these headers alone may not provide sufficient information. Each test should include defined limits, what needs to be measured, where measurements should be taken, how to manipulate the product under testing conditions, and even instructions on setting the product to a required state. If the product requires communication commands or responds in certain ways, these details should also be included. Pay close attention to communication methods - ensuring compatibility between standard methods and any customer-specific modifications can save valuable integration time and prevent unnecessary schedule impacts.\nWhen testing products in production, it's essential to consider which specific tests are truly necessary. R&D level testing is typically not needed at this stage. By avoiding redundant double-testing and leveraging previous phase results (if applicable), you can optimize both test time and production costs while reducing investment in additional instrumentation.\u00c2\nAt Etteplan, we believe in challenging the status quo and driving meaningful progress across various sectors. Our aim is to provide you with sophisticated yet approachable expertise as an authoritative source for big questions related to test systems and specifications.\nLet's embrace ambition together by prioritizing relevance and delivering lasting change through meticulously crafted test specifications! \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00a1\u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00aa\nLearn how Etteplan can support you with production testing:\u00c2\u00a0https://lnkd.in/dmB3tDt6\n#testertuesday\u00c2\u00a0#TestSpecifications\u00c2\u00a0#TestSystem\u00c2\u00a0#productiontester\u00c2\u00a0#productionsolutions\u00c2\u00a0#automation\u00c2\u00a0#industrialautomation\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n32,164 followers\nVi s\u00c3\u00b6ker olika typer av mjukvaruutvecklare i Link\u00c3\u00b6ping!\u00c2\u00a0\u00f0\u0178\u0161\u20ac\nVill du ha f\u00c3\u00b6rm\u00c3\u00a5nen att f\u00c3\u00a5 arbeta med projekt som bidrar till samh\u00c3\u00a4llsnytta utifr\u00c3\u00a5n olika perspektiv som h\u00c3\u00a5llbarhet, trygghet och innovation?

We make them smart through self-learning, anomaly detection, predictions of future faults, and by identifying what makes them work at an optimum and be more intuitive.\nThe unique component, based on seven years of machine-learning research at the University of Bor\u00c3\u00a5s, is a small embedded Advanced Analytics software engine that we license (OEM) to software and hardware developers. Ekkono\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tiny footprint enables it to run on the actual device, i.e. do Edge Analytics. This applies even to small micro controller platforms at par with RaspberryPi/Arduino, and smartphones (iPhone, Android).\nThe result is personalized intelligence for ever individual unit, instant response, less data traffic, lower network load, and consistent functionality, even when losing connectivity to the Internet. This translates into money as you proactively avoid unscheduled maintenance (Predictive Maintenance), and by optimizing each asset\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s performance. You upgrade your things from being connected to becoming smart. Ekkono\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s solution increases data integrity by sending pre-processed instead of raw data, which is hard to interpret for a third party. It also makes your products more pleasant as they become more intuitive. By doing this on the actual device, you make better use of computing capacity; And by adding Ekkono\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s crowdsourcing capabilities to cross-reference between multiple units, you make use of the intelligence of many.\nExtern l\u00c3\u00a4nk f\u00c3\u00b6r Ekkono Solutions\nAdresser\nN\u00c3\u00a4tv\u00c3\u00a4gen 7\nTr\u00c3\u00a4sl\u00c3\u00b6vsl\u00c3\u00a4ge, Halland County 432 75, SE\nAnst\u00c3\u00a4llda p\u00c3\u00a5 Ekkono Solutions\nAnders Berg\nKriss Andsten\nJon Linden\nJohan Hesslind\nUppdateringar\n2\u00c2\u00a0048 f\u00c3\u00b6ljare\n#ces2024\nis right around the corner!!

It is based on the research by Rikard K\u00f6nig, a PhD\u00a0and Senior Lecturer in Machine Learning. He presented his work to serial entrepreneur Jon Lind\u00e9n, who immediately fell in love with the idea of making IoT devices more intelligent. Together with Anders Alneng and Joakim Andersson, both previous co-workers to Jon, they founded Ekkono. Today, the company consists of a diverse team of experienced entrepreneurs, Machine Learning Engineers, Data Scientists and Embedded Developers. Together, we\u2019re striving to make the earth a better place with technology.\nEkkono is born out of seven years of machine learning research. More precisely in the area of high performance computing and predictive analytics. The result is a resource efficient small-footprint solution which can run most applicable machine learning algorithms on small platforms. We deliver an edge computing platform for connected things\npackaged in a Software Development Kit.\nThe Edge ML Technology\nEkkono\u2019s edge machine learning software runs onboard the devices such as vehicles, air conditioners and electrical motors. It enables smart, self-learning and predictive features. The traditional machine learning approach is to collect big data from many units over a long period of time. We usually approach the problems from another angle. We learn the normal behavior for an individual device. If something deviates from that normal, we will notice. And the more data we see, the better we get on making the machine learning model adaptive and more precise. With our solutions, your product will only get better with time.\nOur toolkit facilitates use cases like:\nWith Ekkono you can harmonize on one solution for all your edge machine learning needs.\nOur Solution\nThe Internet of Things is a genuine transformation of how product companies do business. For example, it will enable consumption-based pricing, added-value services based on domain expertise, redefining the reseller chain, and more. But this can\u2019t be done manually. It doesn\u2019t scale. It requires automation.\nThe solution for IoT automation spells machine learning. The traditional approach to machine learning, however, where data is collected and processed in gigantic cloud-based data lakes, comes with too many problems and constraints. Ekkono solves this problem by using machine learning in a different way. Instead of looking for common denominators from many, we learn what\u2019s normal for the individual device by running onboard the device \u2013 edge machine learning. In other words, we really do edge machine learning, not just edge inference. Our core business is about predictions, and this is happening now.\nContact us\nAbout\nNewsletter\n\u00a9 Ekkono Solutions AB"

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

The new manufacturing center will help accelerate U.S. buildouts of high-speed fiber broadband networks and connect the unconnected.\nWith the campus\u2019s two new facilities, Corning will help provide U.S. network operators with the cable they need to bring high-speed fiber connectivity to underserved communities, particularly in rural America. These advanced manufacturing facilities will add hundreds of jobs to Corning\u2019s existing North Carolina workforce of more than 5,000. The new campus is part of a series of investments by Corning totaling more than $500 million since 2020, helping to meet growing fiber and cable demand and strong customer commitments.\nU.S. Commerce Secretary Gina M. Raimondo, whose agency is spearheading the national \u201cInternet for All\u201d initiative, joined the facilities\u2019 opening ceremonies along with North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Stephen Milner, CEO of Planters Broadband Cooperative, on behalf of NTCA\u00a0\u2013 The Rural Broadband Association.\n\"It is past time that every American be connected with affordable internet no matter where they live,\" said Secretary Raimondo. \"We could not do it without the folks at Corning. We wouldn\u2019t have the fiber, the innovation, the cable. We wouldn\u2019t be able to connect rural America \u2013 all of America.\"\nPublic and private investments continue to drive a large, multi-year wave of growth for fiber-based networks. Corning, as the inventor of optical fiber and the industry leader, is uniquely positioned to support these network buildouts.\n\"High-speed internet is critical for North Carolinians to work, learn, get health care online, and connect with one another,\" North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said. \"Manufacturers like Corning know our strong workforce and economy make North Carolina the best place to do business, and we\u2019re glad to partner with them to create more good paying jobs in Hickory.\"\n\u201cWith this new manufacturing campus, we\u2019re creating local jobs, we\u2019re helping our workforce build important skills, we\u2019re cultivating our next generation of talent right here in North Carolina, and we\u2019re thrilled to continue addressing demand for the fiber and cable that are so vital to moving the world forward,\u201d said Corning Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Wendell P. Weeks. \u201cWe appreciate the support of federal, state, local officials, and industry organizations as we come together to help connect the unconnected and to make \u2018Internet for All\u2019 a reality.\u201d\nCorning recently launched a\u00a0strategic supply collaboration\u00a0with NTCA to support rural network buildouts, providing NTCA members with a specially reserved supply of cable and connectivity solutions.\n\u201cWe thank Corning for the work it has done to increase domestic production capacity and to help address the concerns of smaller, rural providers regarding access to fiber-optic cable,\u201d said Milner, CEO of Planters Broadband, a cooperative broadband provider in Newington, Georgia. \u201cWe look forward to continuing to work with Secretary Raimondo and her team to help ensure that the vision of the bipartisan infrastructure law can be realized.\u201d\nCorning has manufactured optical fiber and cable in North Carolina for more than 40 years. With the opening of the Trivium campus, Corning will manufacture optical cable at two sites in Hickory and at sites in Newton and Winston-Salem. The company manufactures optical fiber in Concord and Wilmington.

As part of this funding, Ekkono\u2019s existing investors are joined by the Finnish technology service company Etteplan Oyj (HEL:ETTE) who acquires 20% of the company. In addition to the investment, Etteplan will resell Ekkono\u2019s software to drive the fourth industrial revolution at their customers in machine and equipment manufacturing.\n\u201cEtteplan is a perfect investor for us\u201d, says Jon Lind\u00e9n, CEO of Ekkono. \u201cNot only do we secure growth capital to elevate Ekkono to the next level, but we also extend our reach to more customers through a partner that can deliver comprehensive solutions and provide credibility to a disruptive technology like ours. We have an overlap in customers, which shows that both we and Etteplan work with the industrial frontrunners of digital transformation.\u201d\n\u201cDigital technology offers Etteplan a huge growth potential\u201d, says Juha N\u00e4kki, President and CEO of Etteplan. \u201cThis is an exciting step for us as we invest in a technology start-up company, but we found such a great product and a strong team at Ekkono that it convinced us to move ahead.\u201d\nThe proceeds will primarily be used to accelerate business growth. \u201cThe last two years have been tough as the pandemic has been bad for new product innovation\u201d, says Jon Lind\u00e9n. \u201cA lot of customer projects have been postponed. But we\u2019ve seen a dramatic increase in activity since mid-Q1 this year, which started paying off in Q2. Now, it\u2019s time to accelerate and capitalize on our first mover advantage.

This incremental learning enables individual learning of normal behavior per device, early detection of deviations, instant insights instead of waiting while collecting data for a year, insights that get better and better over time, training on real-time, high-frequency sensor data instead of blunt averages sent to the cloud, re-training to new conditions, and improved data integrity.\nThe core of the product is a C++ or C library, surrounded by an API with bindings to Python and C#, and a comprehensive SDK with AutoML functionality, integration, and optimization tools. Ekkono has, together with Infineon, ensured optimal performance on Infineon\u2019s platforms.\nEkkono Edge Intelligence:\nEkkono offers comprehensive edge machine learning (ML) software. The core is a C++ or C library. Only a few lines of code are required to call Ekkono\u2019s library in deployment. The library supports multiple ML algorithms like regression trees, random forests, and neural networks. Ekkono enables pipelining, inference, training, anomaly/change detection, sensitivity analysis, and conformal prediction to run at the edge in real-time and in memory.\nThe Ekkono SDK includes AutoML tools, and Studio provides pre-defined code snippets. The run-time \u2013 provided as source code for compilation on your target platform \u2013 is separated from the ML model for seamless migration between Python, C, and C++, and model hot-swapping in operation.\nVirtual Aperture Imaging Software:\nAutomotive See-With-Sound (SWS):\nCameras, lidar, and radar can\u2019t see around corners, and they can\u2019t see emergency vehicles that are far away but fast approaching. With the addition of obstructed view scenarios into the safety standards of Euro NCAP and other international testing bodies, finding new ways to detect threats is critical.\nReality AI\u2019s Automotive See-With-Sound (SWS) system detects and localizes threats that LOS sensors can\u2019t see. Adding Automotive SWS to ADAS and AV systems makes vehicles even safer by using sound to detect and position a wide array of common threats to passenger safety. SWS uses\u00a0XENSIV\u2122\u00a0MEMS microphones(IM67D130A),\u00a0the AURIX\u2122 Microcontroller (TC387),\u00a0and unique detection and localization software to give cars the ability to see around corners and through visual obstacles. This solution can detect and localize emergency vehicles, cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles, and joggers.\nWith the powerful combination of Infineon hardware, detection, and localization provided from our AI models, and our AI-engineered firmware, Reality AI\u2019s solution gives passengers a new level of protection.\nAvailability\nRelated links\nClick\u00a0here\u00a0and take a look at the press release\nTeraki has successfully implemented its embedded client for Intelligent Signal Processing on the latest generation of Infineon\u2019s AURIX\u2122 microcontrollers (TC3xx), one of the most commonly used real-time controllers in the automotive industry.
