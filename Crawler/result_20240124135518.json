It's reshaping advertising, transforming healthcare with detailed patient assessments, and enhancing hospitality experiences. The technology unlocks limitless possibilities, akin to the revolution smartphones brought 15 years ago.\nHolographs have been a staple of the future ever since the first sci-fi movies showed them way back whenever. Ever since then they\u2019ve captivated minds and techies have been trying to come up with cool and convincing ways of making it work.\nRelated: Check out all of our latest CES 2024 coverage here.\nFor a while, we seemed to have given up on holographic, relying more on CGI on account of we were getting most of our entertainment through screens anyway, but then, in 2012 at Coachella, Tupac made a holographic appearance that led a lot of us to question whether or not he had really died. Unfortunately, he did, but that just goes to show you what holographic technology had been doing all that time.\nWell, since then, 12 years have passed, and Holoconnects has taken up the torch in the world of holographics with their latest and greatest with Holobox, currently showcased at CES 2024.\nLet\u2019s take a closer look and see if we can tell immersive graphics from reality and find out what all the fuss is about.\nInstead of going with the gimmick, Holobox blazes the trail on the practical uses of holographics while having a bit of fun. As it turns out, there\u2019s more than one application for the new tech.\nRedefined Advertising With Holobox\nFor the advertisement industry, the arrival of Holobox ushers in an era of immersive and impactful brand experiences. It offers a mechanism for advertisers to create captivating 3D representations of products or messages, ensuring memorable interactions that can significantly boost brand recognition and engagement.\nI challenge you to forget the time a holographic person tried selling you a soda, go ahead, give it a try, I know I can\u2019t.\nHolography in Healthcare\nIn the realm of health technology, the Holobox is revolutionizing medical practices by introducing an innovative solution for healthcare professionals to actively participate in patient assessments and contribute valuable insights to potential surgeries. The holographic interfaces play a pivotal role in offering a more immersive and detailed perspective on patient data, empowering medical experts to conduct thorough assessments. One of the key advantages lies in the ability for professionals to remotely collaborate, enabling experts from diverse locations to virtually engage in patient intakes and share their expertise.\nThe Future of Hospitality\nIn terms of the hospitality industry, the Holobox is emerging as an innovative solution to enhance guest experiences. It offers a new way to provide concierge services, display hotel amenities, or even to act as a virtual tour guide.\nWould be nice next time I\u2019m walking around the hotel that used to be a mansion trying to find breakfast in the morning after a hangover\u2026oh don\u2019t act like you haven\u2019t been there.\nReally what the Holobox has done is more than what it\u2019s done. It\u2019s given us the equivalent of paper and pen with the freedom to come up with the new application for this incredible tech. You really are only limited with your own mind when it comes to this thing, so yeah, maybe we\u2019re witnessing the new revolution similar to smartphones 15 years ago, we might have a new take on reality, and yeah, i\u2019m ready for it.\n5 Smart home gadgets launched at CES 2024 you\u2019ll want to buy right now\nCenter Cam V2.0 review: this middle-screen webcam takes up less display real estate\nSkwheel One electric ski review: feel like you\u2019re gliding\u2014but without the snow\nCES 2024: will.i.am and Mercedes AMG flipped the charts with this futuristic automotive tech\nTransparent displays at CES 2024\u2013LG vs Samsung\nSmart thermostats your home needs before winter steps in\nMacBook Pro with M1 Max and M1 Pro: which one should you buy?\nLaunching a Kickstarter or Indiegogo campaign soon?

Marc told us about their three products, the Holobox, the Modular Holobox, and the Holobox Mini, which can project holograms of any image, such as people, products, or logos. He explained that their products are very easy to use and only require electricity and internet to bring holograms anywhere.\nWhen asked about their holographic technology use cases, Marc mentioned various industries, including hospitality, advertising, education, and entertainment, where their products can be utilized. He gave examples like creating virtual hosts or receptionists in the hospitality industry and live or pre-recorded holograms of speakers, celebrities, or experts in education and entertainment.\nMarc also talked about their clients and partners who are already using their technology in various ways, including UNICEF and CERF, who have partnered with Holoconnects to create holograms that raise awareness and support for their causes. D&B The Facility Group and CIC Hospitality also use their products as virtual hosts and hotel receptionists.\nWhen asked about the difference between their technology and other avatars or virtual characters available in the market, Marc explained that their technology creates realistic and interactive holograms. Their holograms are designed to capture the appearance, voice, and gestures of the person or object being projected, and they also have a 3D effect.\nRegarding competition in the holographic market, Marc confirmed that they have competitors, but he believes that Holoconnects has the best technology and price. Their products are more affordable and scalable than their competitors. They also offer customization options, such as the Modular Holobox, which can create bigger holograms of cars or animals.\nMarc informed us that they have already entered the US market and have an office in Miami, which started a few months ago. They are also launching their latest Modular Holobox innovation at CES 2024. This product combines multiple Holoboxes to create bigger and better holograms.\nFinally, Marc shared that the company has experienced significant growth since its inception three years ago. They have 25 employees and are growing more than 100% every year. Holoconnects has also expanded its market reach and has clients and partners all over the world.

For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

This year, the trade show played host to 4,000 exhibitors and, naturally, there were a few recurring patterns in the products being shown. Overall, AI was omnipresent throughout the event, used to power gaming hardware, robots and appliances alike. Other gadgets and hardware were comparably unexpected, including a surprise showdown between Samsung and LG.\nAs CES 2024 comes to a close, Hypebeast has rounded up some of the dominant trends that were on display.\nAdvancements in AI\nBaracoda Daily Healthtech\nThe prevalence of AI at CES 2024 was unsurprising, as advancements in technology have dominated the industry\u2019s discourse in recent months \u2014 though the sheer variety of AI-enabled software and products being presented was refreshing. Among the most impressive uses of AI was an \u201cInnovation Awards Honoree,\u201d the BMind Smart Mirror. Developed by Baracoda Daily Healthtech, the bathroom mirror is designed to improve self-worth and mental health. As users stand in front of the mirror, it uses facial and gesture recognition and voice commands to analyze one\u2019s expression and tone. It\u2019ll then provide recommendations and affirmations and improve one\u2019s mental state based on their current level of well-being.\nCappella, meanwhile, shone in the AI-powered app space. The app claims an ability to \u201ctranslate\u201d voice recordings of a baby\u2019s cries to determine their needs. Cappella says that the app is 95% accurate, compared to the typical 30% accuracy with which humans can guess their baby\u2019s needs. Other uses of AI were more traditional, albeit less flashy. HP rolled out a powerful chip, the HP Spectre x360 14, for its laptop of the same name, which is packed with subtle, AI-enabled features such as a screen that automatically dims when a user looks away.\nMercedes also engineered an immersive, AI-enabled experience for driving a Mercedes-AMG. The automaker utilizes a combination of sensors and software for MBUX SOUND DRIVE, an in-car experience that corresponds music to the driver\u2019s actions, whether they\u2019re speeding up, slowing down or stopping at a red light. The cutting-edge tech is described as\u201ctransforming the car into a \u201cvirtual musical instrument\u201d and launched with a campaign fronted by the experiential-focused artist, will.i.am.\nNext-Generation Gaming\nMsi\nGaming hardware is a recurring trend at CES. Razer inked an exciting partnership with Samsung to help develop its Blade 16 Laptop. Featuring a 240Hz OLED panel, the gaming laptop has a 0.2ms response time and a 100% DCI-P3 rate, meaning the computer can reproduce all of the colors that may appear in a given game with complete accuracy.\nFor those who prefer to play on a larger screen but don\u2019t want to shell out on a monitor, the 100-inch XGIMI Aladdin projector is built to specifically showcase games at 1080p resolution. It\u2019s also entirely controlled through voice commands.\nMSI and Hyperkin took size in the opposite direction with new handhelds. MSI\u2019s Claw A1M handheld is the first of its kind to pack Intel\u2019s cutting-edge gaming chip, the Intel Core Ultra 7-155H, which features an NPU dedicated to processing AI in video games. For those nostalgic for the Sega Genesis, Hyperkin\u2019s Mega 95 revives the bulky aesthetic and updates the model with a 5-inch screen. The handheld is capable of playing original Genesis cartridges thanks to a similar hardware setup as the 1989 controller.\nTransparent TV Screens\nLg\nSamsung and LG both debuted their first transparent screens at CES 2024, making for a showdown no one quite expected. Despite their similar products, the brands took different approaches to their designs. Samsung\u2019s MicroLED TV, true to its name, relies on a microLED panel, which doesn\u2019t require backlighting but can still render sharp images due to the pixel density. The TV was displayed against transparent OLED and transparent LCD models from Samsung to highlight the breakthrough with microLEDs specifically.\nLG\u2019s OLED Signature TV, on the other hand, takes up the challenge of implementing OLED technology. When showing content, blacks and greys on the TV appear transparent, simply hued with the color. Samsung\u2019s version appeared to lend itself to greater color saturation but wasn\u2019t totally transparent when turned off. LG\u2019s truly was crystal clear, although the transparency of darker colors means it won\u2019t totally block out the environment behind the TV. Despite their differences, both models were lauded for breaking ground in the transparent screen department, making developments that could be expanded to computers and monitors in the future.\nMulti-Purpose Robotics\nHoloconnects\nMany people have a specific image that comes to mind when they think of a robot \u2013 a humanoid bot like Ex Machina. At CES, robotics developers remind consumers that a bot can take virtually any form. WIRobotics showed off a belt called WIM, designed to aid seniors and those with limited mobility with walking. Described as an \u201cultra-lightweight walking assist robot,\u201d WIM locks around a user\u2019s waist and is strapped onto each leg. The bot relies on biomechanics to place resistance on a user\u2019s motions for increased support, similar to the feeling of walking on water. The device pairs with WIRobotics\u2019 AI coaching program to track musculoskeletal data and work towards movement performance goals.\nAnother standout in the unconventional robotics space is Holoconnects\u2019 Holobox. What looks to be a telephone box is in fact a monitor for displaying 3D renderings of a person, so that you can see who you\u2019re talking to in real-time. 3D hologram technology has already existed for a few years but most devices require a complex setup with several rotating cameras to render an individual. The Holobox merely needs to be plugged into an outlet and for its user to stand in front of a white wall so their likeness can be clearly captured. The company also has a desktop-sized version, the Holobox Mini, if a company wants to take Zoom meetings into the third dimension.\nSmart Home Technology\nPhillips\nA smart bidet isn\u2019t a necessity, but owning one can make the experience of going to the bathroom just a bit more luxurious. Kohler\u2019s PureWash E930 is a bidet attachment that fixes onto a traditional toilet and can be commanded entirely using one\u2019s voice through compatibility with Amazon\u2019s Alexa and Google Assistant. To turn it on and off, warm the seat and change the water temperature and pressure, all a user has to do is tell the bidet. Amid the growing lineup of smart toilets, which can run into the tens of thousands, the PureWash is a wallet-friendly alternative.\nOther companies in the smart home sector made the case that the days of a traditional lock and key are behind us. Lockly\u2018s new Visage smart lock uses a face-scanning protocol similar to Apple\u2019s FaceID to replace the run-of-the-mill deadbolt, ideal for when one is walking through the door with their hands full of grocery bags. The company is also working on Apple device compatibility so that users can tap their iPhone or use voice commands to unlock the front door.\nPhilips offered its own security solution, dubbed the Phillips Wi-Fi Palm Recognition Smart Deadbolt. Rather than scanning one\u2019s face, the smart lock takes a scan of an individual\u2019s palm vein pattern. The lock can save up to 50 palm patterns at a time and doubles as a doorbell.\nWhat to Read Next\nIntel-Powered MSI Claw Handheld Gaming Console Unveiled at CES 2024\nTAG Heuer Returns to the High Seas with the Nautical Carrera Skipper Watch\nSpanto's Friends and Family Share Fond Memories of the Late Designer, in Conversation With 'Vogue'\nThe Jordan Hex Mule Stands Out in \"Brilliant Orange\"\nGraffiti Legend JA ONE XTC Lends His Iconic Two-Letter Tag to New Awake NY Capsule\nChanel Is Heading to Marseille for Its Cruise 2024/25 Show\nAction Bronson Reveals Yet Another New Balance 1906R Collaboration, the \"Medusa Az\u00fal\"\nLouis Vuitton Introduces Men\u2019s Fine Jewelry Line\nNew Balance\u2019s Latest 1906D Pack Proves \u201800s Inspired Metallics Are Here to Stay\nParis Texas: A Raw and Rapid Interview\nRich Brian and Rick Ross Link Up On 1999 WRITE THE FUTURE's new track \"LiGht rAiLs\"\nStone Island's \"Compass Inside\" Campaign Highlights Global Community Members\nEverything Dropping at HBX Archives This Week\nGrand Seiko Envisages an Aerial View of Ginza on the Limited-Edition SBGH317\n2024 Hypebeast Limited.

If you buy through affiliate links, we may earn commissions, which help support our testing.\nCES 2024: The Coolest Things We've Seen So Far\nOf all the awesome technology we encountered during the first day of the show, here's what has us the most excited.\nThe PCMag team is currently on the ground in Las Vegas working hard to bring you the latest tech from CES 2024. But while we're dutifully reporting on PC specs and the latest in EVs, we're also taking note of the all the other amazing, ambitious, and offbeat stuff at the show\u2014even if some of it might never actually make it past the concept phase.\nThis is a list of those things. There are rolling robots, AI that goes everywhere with you, and a box to hold your hologram. Best of all, this is just the tip of the iceberg. We'll update this list throughout the week as CES goes on, so you can check in on the most incredible things at the show without having your step count go so high that even your Fitbit worries about you.\nr1 AI Pocket Companion\nIf you\u2019ve seen any number of \u201880s movies, you might have dreamt of the day that an AI companion could accompany you anywhere. The Rabbit r1 is here to fulfill that promise\u2014though it doesn\u2019t look anything like Johnny 5. Instead, the r1, which is a sort of pocket-sized AI task assistant that responds to voice commands, has a similar look and form factor to the Playdate gaming handheld, and comes in one color: Luminous Orange. It's not technically a smartphone, but it can summon an Uber, put in a dinner order, pull up a Spotify playlist, take photos and video, and perform an internet search. It\u2019s $199 and will ship in March.\nHoloconnects Holobox\nFor when you can\u2019t be everywhere, you can appear in a Holobox from Holoconnects. The life-size box can project your 3D likeness wherever it is, in real-time.\nLooking Glass Go\nIf you want a hologram in your pocket, then you can open up the Looking Glass Go. It has a six-inch screen that displays any holographic images you\u2019ve captured or converted from 2D and it doesn\u2019t require a headset like the Apple Vision Pro.\nSamsung Ballie\nThe Samsung Ballie first showed up at CES in 2020. It was a rotund yellow robot that was designed to be a fitness trainer and a videographer. It never rolled into homes, but this year a new version rolled onto the show floor, this time with built-in AI to answer your household requests (via voice or text) and a projector for movies and video calls.\nSamsung and LG Transparent Displays\nTVs have gotten bigger and cheaper but we\u2019ve never wanted them to disappear more\u2014into our decor, that is. Samsung and LG have an innovative solution with transparent displays. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED Display and LG's Signature OLED T. If you\u2019re eager to see (or see through) these TVs, LG said to expect its OLED T to be on the market later this year, though it did not say for how much. Samsung does not yet have a ship date or price.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIs it a Windows 11 laptop? Or an Android tablet? Well as it turns out, the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is both. When fully together, the ThinkBook functions as a standard Windows laptop. When the display is off, it\u2019s a standalone Android tablet, but with a bonus: you can still access apps and files from your Windows machine. The ThinkBook will be available sometime this summer, with an expected starting price of $1,999.\nCooler Master Shark X\nShark fans can sink their teeth into the Cooler Master Shark X. The design is based on the Leviathan mod that was created for the Cooler Master Case Mod World Series. It\u2019s going to ship as a full system but specs are not yet available.\nLenovo Poncho\nIf you and your Lenovo tablet are expecting extreme weather or have to hang out somewhere for a while, you can both cozy up in this Cocoon Coat. Lenovo partnered with rainwear manufacturer Maium to make a waterproof poncho. It has a pocket for your tablet and it can be inflated for extra warmth. You can also turn the poncho into a hammock that you can zip up into.\nLenovo Magic Bay\u00a0Peripherals\nLenovo\u2019s Magic Bay is a range of peripherals that snap onto select ThinkBook laptops. While they were introduced at last year\u2019s CES, Lenovo has some new designs this year. A lot of them are practical, but we were drawn to the weirder prototypes that may or may not go into production: a ring light and mirror, a small fan, and aromatherapy diffusers. The Chinese market will get a display for an animated face to accompany an on-device AI assistant.\nAbout Chandra Steele\nMy title is Senior Features Writer, which is a license to write about absolutely anything if I can connect it to technology (I can).

Thankfully, CES 2024 had no shortage of real product launches along with strong pitches for recently released tech gadgets.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nZDNET has posted its editor's pick for best of show. I thought I'd also share my personal list of products that I would pay good money for as soon as they are available to buy. These five products are at the top of my queue.\n1. Roborock Flexi Pro\nI've been very impressed with the quality of Roborock's robot vacuums for the past couple years, because even though they weren't first to market they have out-innovated the industry to create 2-in-1 robots that vacuum, mop, and work more reliably than their competitors. I was even more impressed after talking to Roborock's president Quan Gang at CES, where he told me that the first two products that Roborock ever made they scrapped because they weren't happy with the quality and the third product had to succeed because they were out of money. It was an instant hit and now they are one of the top-selling robovac makers globally.\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nAlso: EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra and Smart Home Panel 2 just launched at CES 2024 and ZDNET tested it\nBut the product I loved from CES wasn't a robovac. It's a smart, upright, wet/dry vacuum called the Roborock Flexi Pro (because sometimes a robovac can't get everywhere or you just need a quick cleanup). The Flexi Pro has a beautiful, minimalist design, works as both a vacuum and a mop, is self-cleaning, and has 17,000Pa of suction power (twice the power of most robovacs). The price and release date haven't been announced yet, and I can't wait to learn more.\nRoborock Flexi Lite (left) and Flexi Pro (right)\n2. Ecobee Smart Doorbell Camera\nWhen Ecobee launched its Smart Doorbell Camera in Q4 2023, most of the industry shrugged and thought it was an odd late entrance into a market that has a ton of entrenched competitors from the likes of Ring, Google, Logitech, and Eufy and low-cost stalwarts like Blink, Wyze, and Arlo. But after getting a demo of the Ecobee Smart Doorbell Camera and talking to Ecobee CEO Greg Fyke at CES, I came away very impressed with the fact that the Ecobee team got into smart doorbells because there were specific issues with the existing products on the market and they were confident they could improve on them and deliver a better product.\nAlso: The best smart home tech at CES 2024\nThe biggest improvement is the field of view. Most doorbell cameras are great for seeing someone coming to the door, but they can't see a package that's set right in front of the door. The Ecobee doorbell has a 175-degree field of view so that it can see something that's set flush against the door. I tried this in my CES demo and it works great. I have this problem today and so I have a second camera on my porch to see packages. And since I already have an Ecobee thermostat and have been very happy with the quality, features, and usability, another nice feature of the Ecobee doorbell is that it can use the screen on your Ecobee thermostat to view the doorbell camera. It also previews on Apple Watch. You can also use the Ecobee thermostat as your doorbell chime. Keep in mind that it's wired only, so it won't work for everyone. Still, the Ecobee Smart Doorbell Camera retails for $160, is available today, and I'd love to use it to replace my current two-camera setup.\nEcobee Smart Doorbell Camera\n3. Samsung S95D OLED TV\nOkay, I should preface this by saying I would LIKE to buy this TV as soon as it's released -- whether I can afford to buy it will be a different matter. (We'll see when it comes out this spring.) Nevertheless, I've already called the S95D \"the best TV of CES 2024\" and the TV with the best picture quality in the world right now. Last year's model (S95C) was already among the consensus top three TVs in the world based on picture quality -- the other two being the LG G3 and the Sony A95L -- at least among TVs consumers can buy at retail.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 products impressed me\nAnd then Samsung announced a new feature at CES 2024 that changed the game. The S95D now has a glare-free screen and in my time with the product at CES I was blown away by how effective it is. Glare is one of the biggest drawbacks on virtually all OLED TVs. They have amazing dynamic range, intense colors, and impressive black levels, but it's hard to use them in bright rooms because they don't have the strong backlight of LCD and QLED TVs and because they become mirrors for windows and lamp lights. The S95D overcomes this with its new anti-reflective display. We tested it with a bright flashlight on a smartphone camera and was amazed at how well it dispersed the intense light and turned it into a soft glow that the TV's picture could overwhelm. That's why I consider it the TV with the best picture quality a consumer can buy, and why I'd like to get one. Pricing won't be announced until spring, but I expect it will start around $2,500 for a 55-inch model before it gets discounted during the fall shopping season.\nSamsung S95D OLED TV with glare-free display\n4. Vasco Translator E1\nOne of the most impressive demos I had at CES 2024 was with the team of the Vasco Translator E1, an earpiece that uses AI and an app to translate 49 languages in real time. We tested it with a member of the Vasco team speaking a Polish, my ZDNET colleague Sabrina Ortiz speaking in Spanish, and me speaking in English and the E1 earpiece automatically translated between the three languages in our ear as well as displaying the translations in text on the phone app. There was a slight delay and the translations were about 80-90 percent accurate, but it was remarkable how well it let us communicate across the barrier of three different languages. The product will be released in Q2 2024 and pricing isn't available yet.\nAlso:\u00a0The 12 best mobile accessories at CES 2024: iPhone call recorder, Qi2 chargers, and more\nThe team already has a product available, the Vasco Translator V4, a handheld mobile device that translates 108 languages and has a built-in SIM card that works in roughly 200 countries and includes connectivity for the lifetime of the device. The V4 costs $389 and it will work with the E1 earpiece when it's released. My colleagues Kerry Wan and Sabrina Ortiz also demoed a competing product, the TimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub, and found it to be a little more accurate than Vasco's products and it worked better in loud spaces. However, in the volunteer work I do in community building and with a youth literacy program, I regularly collaborate with immigrants who speak less common languages that are covered by Vasco (such as Swahili and Persian) and are not covered by TimeKettle, and that's why I'm more interested in Vasco's product. Oh, and the fact that the TimeKettle device costs $700 -- although it does include two earpieces similar to the E1 as well.\nVasco Translator E1 (black earpieces) and Translator V4 device (middle)\n5. Oclean X Ultra S smart toothbrush\nSmart toothbrushes have a long and interesting history at CES. I've lost count of how many I've demoed over the years. But none of them ever convinced me to put aside my old school Philips Sonicare toothbrush that I've been using for almost a decade (while regularly replacing the brush heads, of course). This year I think I might have found the one I've been waiting for, though. The Oclean X Ultra S has a built-in display to give you instant feedback on any spots you missed and a brushing score, WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity, a bone-conducting speaker that tells you if you're brushing too fast or applying too much pressure, Apple Health integration, and 4-6 months of battery life.\nThe Oclean X Ultra S will come to the US market in Q3 and will cost $130. Considering that high-end smart toothbrushes from market leaders Philips and Oral-B cost $300 to $350, the Oclean X Ultra S can bring tech-enabled brushing to a lot more people. The Oclean app is currently not rated nearly as well as Philips, Oral-B, Colgate, and other smart toothbrush apps on the Apple App Store, so Oclean may still have some work to do to improve usability and the overall digital experience. But based on what I saw at CES 2024, this product has a lot going for it and is coming in at a price that I finally feel comfortable paying for a smart toothbrush.\nOclean X Ultra S smart toothbrush and carrying case\nRelated\nJackery's CES 2024 concept products are pretty sci-fi - and super cool\nThe best CES 2024 tech you can buy right now\nThe best headphones of CES 2024"
