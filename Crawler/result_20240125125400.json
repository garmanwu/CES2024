Our team of eight executives hit the ground running to cover as much as possible.\nGerald Cruz, Director of Business Development, sums up the team\u2019s efforts:\n\u201cThe atmosphere at CES was nothing short of electric, signaling a powerful resurgence of business opportunities in 2024 and it\u2019s evident that the industry is making a triumphant return to the spotlight. Over three days our team met with over 50 new emerging technology vendor partners discussing runways for mutual business. The impact our dedicated team had on exploring new vendor opportunities was truly remarkable. To name a few \u2013 EKSAtelecom headsets, Tanoshi kids computers, Mojawa headphones, Blacklyte gaming, Enabot family robot, NEX Playground, and Aqara smart home.\n\u201cEqually important was our commitment to support our existing vendor community. Strengthening these relationships is fundamental to our success, and CES 2024 allowed us to reaffirm our dedication to the growth and prosperity of our valued partners. We had the privilege of meeting with partners such as Garmin, MP Mobile Pixels, Lorex, Uniden, RCA VOXX, torras, and many more.\n\u201cI couldn\u2019t be more proud of the strides we made at CES. The momentum generated at the show will undoubtedly propel Petra Industries to new heights in 2024 and beyond.\u201d\nPetra is also proud to applaud our brand partners XGIMI and Garmin. They were CES Innovation Awards 2024 Honorees.\nWhat Caught Our Eye\nWith thousands and thousands of products and concepts on display, it\u2019s hard to be selective, but we did our best.
