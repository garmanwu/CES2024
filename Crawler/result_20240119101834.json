Under the theme of \"Smarter Home, Better Life\" Yaber is showcasing its latest entertainment projectors, including the innovative ultra short throw laser projector K300, 1600ANSI high brightness projector K3 and the first built-in battery handy projector T2s, etc.\nInnovative Ultra Short Throw Laser Projector - K300\nThe K300 revolutionizes projection with ultra-short-throw and triple laser technology, breaking traditional distance constraints for a more precise image.

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nCES 2024: The Best in Travel Tech, From Personal Planes and a will.i.am.-Designed Mercedes-Benz Sound System to an AI-Enabled E-Bike\nApple Vision Pro Is Available for Pre-Order: Here's When You Can Get the New VR Headset Online\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office. It\u2019s expected to launch on Amazon this year.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nKendra Wilkinson Reflects on Her Time as Playmate After Depression Diagnosis: \u201cPlayboy Really Messed Up My Whole Life\u201d\nLana Del Rey Channels Old Hollywood Screen Sirens in Skims\u2019 New Valentine\u2019s Day Campaign\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Is Available for Pre-Order: Here\u2019s When the New Smartphone Starts Shipping\nSee the Cover of the Next \u2018Percy Jackson\u2019 Novel\n(Exclusive)\nGreen Carpet Fashion Awards Set L.A.

More consumers in the US can now bring cinema-quality images and entertainment straight to their homes \u2014 and outside them, too.\nFrom establishing branches in the US and EU to developing connections with retailers worldwide, YABER is fast becoming a brand known across the globe. As part of its wide-ranging growth plans, YABER's entrance onto Best Buy's online store by selling its innovative entertainment projectors is a significant step in successfully expanding its global sales channels and product offerings.\n\"By showcasing our pioneering technology using Best Buy's online store, we can harness its massive reach and influence to further our connection with North American audiences,\" said Vicent Wang, CEO of YABER. \"Our mission is to show the world that our home entertainment projectors bring the beauty of the big screen straight into people's homes as well as outside them. From indoor movie nights and video gaming sessions to backyard get-togethers and outdoor film screenings, YABER's projectors can be used almost anywhere, at any time. Wherever customers are, YABER is here to bring them endless big-screen entertainment.

It is also the first LCD projector to include anti-oxidation bimetallic brackets, which provide improved ventilation and height \u2013 key benefits which set it apart from the competition.\nYABER's Vicent Wang added, \"2022 is the year that YABER is truly going global.

Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "LAS VEGAS, Jan. 4, 2023 \u2014 (PRNewswire) \u2014\nYaber, the leading entertainment projector brand, unveils the world's first smart LCD projector: the K2s at CES 2023. Yaber will also exhibit two other newly launched products at the event: the Ace K1 and the Pico T1.\nVicent Wang, CEO of Yaber, commented: \"At Yaber, our mission is to create the most innovative home entertainment projectors for our customers, and the K2s is testament to that.\" He continued: \"The perfect combination of simple and smart, the K2s is easy to use, packed full of features and offers some of the best sound and visuals that money can buy, making it an essential for any home theater.\"\nNext-Generation Home Theater: K2s\nFor those looking for a smart projector, the K2s shines. Easily project video from your phone with NFC technology, then use Amazon Alexa voice control to adjust volume and settings. Plus, Intelligent Screen Adaption technology automatically takes care of focusing and screen adjustment, giving you the perfect picture every time.\nThe Yaber K2s projects 800 ANSI Lumens of brightness, enough to enjoy what you're watching even with background lighting. The built-in independent sound chamber and JBL speakers with DOLBY compatibility cranks out crisp and clear audio whether you're watching movies or gaming. And, with the integrated dongle which gives you access to over 7000 apps, the K2s is one of the smartest, most versatile projectors available.\nProjector Paradise: Ace K1\nAlongside the K2s, Yaber will also present the Ace K1 at CES. The Ace K1 displays stunning visuals, with 650 ANSI Lumens of brightness complimented by a 1080 FHD resolution image. The 150 inches wide projection area also uses Auto Focus and Auto Keystone technology to correct imagery, further adding to the crystal clear quality. Coupled with the 15W speaker, rich colors and dynamic contrast offerings, the K1 brings whatever you're watching to life.\nThe Yaber Ace K1 is built to last too: with a dustproof fully sealed optical engine, dust or particles are prevented from entering the projector, prolonging its lifespan. This means the Ace K1 is the ideal, pocket-friendly projector for everyday use around the home.\nProject Anywhere, Anytime - Pico T1\nYaber gets portable with the Pico T1 - the projector no camping-lover, RV enthusiast or vanlifer should be without. Weighing only 5.3 ounces, the Pico T1 projects an image up to 80 inches wide, making any space a movie theater. The Pico T1 was made for outside the home, but being on the move can mean limited charging opportunities. The Pico T1 is compatible with QC power banks so you can enjoy a movie anywhere anytime.\nWith the option to plug in and play or connect wirelessly, plus an intuitive touch screen for ease of use, this pocket-rocket packs a punch. Plus, with Vertical Auto Keystone to reduce distortion and 110 ANSI Lumens of brightness, the Pico T1 is both small and mighty.\nYou can find the K2s, the Ace K1 and the Pico T1 at Yaber's CES stand #18979 in Central Hall from the 5th January, and Pepcom on the 4th January.\nProduct Availability\nAbout Yaber\nYaber is a world-famous entertainment projector brand founded by Vicent Wang in 2018, dedicated to providing innovative entertainment projectors and creating perfect and immersive audio-visual experiences for everyone.\nBeing a pioneer in the entertainment projector industry, Yaber continuously produces innovative and excellent entertainment projectors which create a better lifestyle by allowing people to get closer to one another.\nFor more information, please visit\nhttps://www.yaber.com/\nMedia Contacts:\nYABER TECHNOLOGIES CO., LIMITED\nEmail Contact\n+86-755-84829256\nView original content to download multimedia:\nhttps://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yaber-unveils-worlds-first-smart-lcd-projector-yaber-k2s-at-ces-2023-301712187.html\nSOURCE YABER TECHNOLOGIES CO., LIMITED"

        "raw_content": "Digital Trends\u2019 Top Tech of CES 2024 Awards\nIt\u2019s hard to explain the feeling and energy surrounding CES. There are fresh ideas and new products everywhere you turn. With so much happening, and thousands of companies competing for attention, manufacturers have to do something really intriguing to have any chance of standing out. But it\u2019s possible \u2013 every year we recognize a group of products that are truly compelling and will help move the industry forward.\nThese are our Top Tech of CES 2024 awards, recognizing the best and most innovative announcements at the show.\nAudio/Video\nLG Signature OLED T\nWhile LG Display has been showing off its transparent OLED screens for several years, it wasn\u2019t until 2024 that its sister company, LG Electronics, figured out how to turn it into a functional TV. We think it was worth the wait.\nAt first blush, the LG Signature OLED T looks like it might be a huge marine aquarium. But at the press of one button, its clear screen lights up like a display out of sci-fi movie. Press another button, and a black film rolls up from the TV\u2019s hidden base, giving the transparent panel an opaque background and making it look like any other LG OLED television.\nThe genius is in the simplicity of LG\u2019s solution, taking what was once a purely commercial technology and transforming it into a home entertainment showpiece. Whether it\u2019s something you\u2019ll be able to afford anytime soon is still unknown, but it\u2019s transformative consumer tech nonetheless.\nSamsung S95D QD-OLED\nSamsung\u2019s top-tier QD-OLED model already was one of the must-have TVs among premium displays, but two improvements to the S95D announced at CES 2024 make it even more desirable than before.\nFirst, all of Samsung\u2019s QD-OLED TVs benefit from new, brighter panels developed by Samsung Display, including the S95D. Second, and more important to those actually purchasing the TV, is that the flagship model now comes with the most remarkable antiglare system we\u2019ve seen implemented on a television.\nIt appears to not rely solely on a matte screen finish, but on an internal layer that seems to absorb light. If you\u2019ve ever used an OLED TV and dealt with the reflections that come with it, you\u2019ll know how big a deal this is.\nTCL QM89 115-inch QLED TV\nAfter seeing plenty of success with its 98-inch models in 2023, TCL decided to lean into large. It will soon be selling the largest consumer television North America has ever seen. Behold, the 115-inch QM89.\nIt\u2019s a QD-mini LED television. It\u2019s massive. But the new QM89 series won\u2019t just be huge, as it\u2019s boasts other top-notch specs, including claimed peak brightness of 5,000 nits, and a whopping 20,000 zones of local dimming.\nHisense UX 110-inch TV\nTCL brought the biggest, but Hisense brought the brightest. The 110-inch Hisense UX is reportedly capable of generating a mind-boggling 10,000 nits of peak brightness, with 40,000 local dimming zones. It\u2019s not quite brighter than the sun, but it\u2019s definitely getting there.\nAnd given Hisense\u2019s history of underpromising and overdelivering, we won\u2019t be surprised if it gets even brighter than claimed. Even if it doesn\u2019t, it definitely stood out not just at Hisense\u2019s CES booth, but among all the televisions at the show.\nCars\nKia PBV Concept\nKia has been one of the most influential companies in terms of the transition to EVs, and it\u2019s done so with a relatively traditional approach to design and a focus on affordability. The PBV Concept shows it\u2019s ready to also take a fresh step into a futuristic vision of what vehicles can be.\nThe PBV (Platform Beyond Vehicle) isn\u2019t so much a vehicle as it is a set of design principles and ideas for a wide range of vehicles that will purpose-built for various use cases. It upends the idea that cars all need to generally look like, well, cars \u2013 and instead looks at how we could take a blank-slate approach. Taxis that have optimized seating layouts and doors, work vans with useful interior layouts, and a wide variety of size options make this a truly versatile platform.\nModular and easy-to-build layouts, external informational displays, and the incorporation of accessibility features are all the little touches that make the PBV Concept so interesting.\nSupernal S-A2 EVTOL aircraft\nIt\u2019s possible to become numb to spectacle at CES, but the towering Supernal S-A2 is enough to make even the grouchiest curmudgeons crane their heads and take notice. With both wings and eight pivoting rotors, this electric aircraft will take off vertically and hit up to 120 miles per hour as it ferries up to four passengers above urban traffic.\nYes, it\u2019s still just a concept. But Supernal plans to begin flying these aircraft in 2028, and with the backing of Hyundai Motor Group and more than 600 employees already, we don\u2019t think that\u2019s just a pipe dream.\nHonda 0 Series concept vehicles\nAfter years of foot-dragging on electric vehicles, Honda made the wait worthwhile at CES 2024 by unveiling two EV concepts that look straight out of Blade Runner. As the 0 Series name implies, both concepts are intended to be a fresh start for Honda\u2019s electric ambitions.\nThe Space Hub is a futuristic van, while the Saloon is a wedge-shaped four-seater that could pass for a supercar. Both have the batteries situated below the floor, and Honda claims they\u2019ll be able to charge from 15% to 80% in just 10 to 15 minutes. While we know better than to expect the production versions to look just like these early versions, we won\u2019t have to wait long, as Honda intends to begin selling them in 2026.\nComputing\nNvidia RTX 4080 Super\nPC components don\u2019t often get the limelight at CES, and for good reason. We need a chance to thoroughly test the hardware before throwing an award at it. The RTX 4080 Super is a rare exception. Built on the back of Nvidia\u2019s RTX 4080, this new Super refresh boosts the specs just a bit, which should provide a minor performance improvement over the base model.\nThat\u2019s not what\u2019s important here, though. It all comes down to price. Nvidia has taken a lot of flak over the past couple of generations for driving GPU prices up, but the RTX 4080 Super actually brings prices down. Nvidia is selling the card for $1,000, and although that\u2019s expensive, it\u2019s far more reasonable for gamers on the hunt for peak performance.\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThe ROG Zephyrus G14 has been leading a revolution in compact gaming laptops ever since its original launch. In 2024, though, it just took a huge step forward once again. In a year when there wasn\u2019t exciting new silicon for gaming laptops, Asus focused on a redesign of the G14 that evolves it in a logical manner.\nThe G14 this year is significantly thinner and more modernized, adding a much larger touchpad and a more refined look. It still has a gaming focus, but this is a more successful mainstream crossover laptop than even the Razer Blade at this point. Throw in an impressive OLED screen and you have a gaming laptop that the rest of the competition is going to be chasing all year.\nAsus ROG Swift PG27AQDP\nCES was all about OLED gaming monitors, but Asus was the only company that stood out with its offering. The PG27AQDP is the only OLED display we saw at the show boasting a 1440p resolution and a staggering 480Hz refresh rate. Just last year, we saw OLED displays only doing half of that refresh rate.\nIt looks like Asus has some sort of exclusive claim to this panel, at least for a bit. It\u2019s by far the fastest OLED gaming monitor we\u2019ve ever seen, and at a resolution that gamers have been begging for. Asus is also making bold claims on brightness, and pushing OLED to places it has never gone before.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nCalling this a 2-in-1 feels like an understatement. The ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid combines two separate computers in a single machine \u2014 one an Android tablet and one a Windows 11 laptop. In other words, the screen can be yanked right off the base of the laptop and used as a 14-inch Android tablet, complete with its own Snapdragon processor, memory, battery, storage, and camera.\nBut that\u2019s just the start. You can also do things like access shared files between them, switch between Android and Windows at the press of a button, or run the whole Android tablet in a window. You can even connect the base of the laptop up to an external monitor to run Windows while using the Android tablet separately. That\u2019s just plain neat. Thanks to how poorly Windows 11 still handles tablet mode, this feels like the best of both worlds \u2014 and I can\u2019t believe it\u2019s the first time it\u2019s been done.\nHyte Nexus Link\nHyte is quickly becoming the little PC company that could. It earned the right to create its own PC ecosystem platform, the Nexus Link. It\u2019s far more than just a tip to die-hard Hyte fans though \u2013 it\u2019s a true innovation in its own right. With a single connection, you can daisy-chain together up to 18 separate devices to your PC to both clean up your system and centralize control.\nStarting with Hyte\u2019s first all-in-one liquid cooler, you can then chain together multiple \u201cnodes\u201d in the Nexus Link chain through either a Type-M or Type-C connection, strung together in one beautiful line of PC glory. It\u2019s not the first time we\u2019ve seen this done, but the ability to connect up to 18 devices makes it possible to run an entire PC on this one ecosystem, all controlled through the Nexus software.\nGaming\nMSI Claw\nWith heavy hitters like Sony staying quiet this year, MSI got to take center stage with its Steam Deck rival, the Claw. At first glance, it might not seem all too different from devices like the Asus ROG Ally. It certainly doesn\u2019t have any of the flashy features of the Legion Go, either. However, MSI\u2019s portable PC stands out where it really counts: power and performance.\nRather than using the Ryzen Z1 Extreme like other recent devices, the MSI claw opts for Intel\u2019s fresh Core Ultra 7 155H instead. That 16-core chip opens the door for some impressive gaming potential. On the show floor, we were able to play Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage, a major new release that just launched a few months ago. Combine that with built-in Intel XeSS support and a 120Hz IPS display, and you\u2019ve got a very capable, Windows-powered handheld.\nWeak batteries are the Achilles\u2019 heel of just about every device of this type on the market today. But the MSI Claw could wind up being the longest-lasting one thanks to its 53 watt-hour battery, which is theoretically 25% better than what\u2019s in the Legion Go. That, combined with a mesh vent cooling system that seems to keep the system fairly quiet, could make it an ideal portable device.\nHyperX Alloy Rise\nIt\u2019s not always the flashiest or most expensive products that catch our eye at CES; sometimes, it\u2019s the simple things that get our attention. That was the case this year with the HyperX Alloy Rise, a customizable mechanical keyboard that could become a new go-to for PC gamers. Like similar keyboards, it features hot-swappable keys that are easy to get on and off, but its real advantage comes down to what those switches sit on. The Alloy Rise uses a gasket mounting system, which gives the entire thing a more premium feel.\nWhat\u2019s especially exciting is its seamless customization potential. In addition to letting players swap out switches, the Alloy Rise\u2019s aluminum shell can be popped off and swapped with a new one in a matter of seconds. That might not sound impressive, but it\u2019s a major improvement over keyboards like the GMMK Pro, which can take 45 minutes to customize. By comparison, the Alloy Rise can get a full makeover in an instant, potentially making it the most convenient option on the market for those who love changing their style to match whatever they\u2019re playing.\nMobile\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nCES 2024 showed us one of the coolest iPhone accessories we\u2019ve seen in ages: the Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro. It kind of looks like a wireless iPhone charger \u2014 and it kind of is! When you put your iPhone on the Stand Pro, the MagSafe pad wirelessly charges it at 15 watts. But that\u2019s only the beginning.\nWhen your iPhone is on the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro, you open the camera to begin the magic. The camera automatically locks on to your face and follows you around with 360 degrees of motion and 90 degrees of up-and-down tilting. Whether you\u2019re recording a TikTok video, having a FaceTime call with your family, or are on a Microsoft Teams call, you can move around however you want while still staying in frame. It works with your iPhone\u2019s selfie and rear cameras, and you can even use the Stand Pro completely wirelessly with up to five hours of battery life.\nDoes everyone need Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro? Probably not. But it\u2019s a fascinating feat of engineering, and it\u2019s easily one of the coolest mobile gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nClicks Creator Keyboard\nSpeaking of interesting iPhone accessories, we have to talk about the Clicks Creator Keyboard. From the back, it looks like any other iPhone case, just a bit longer than usual. Look at Clicks from the front, however, and you\u2019ll find a full physical keyboard.\nVirtual keyboards have gotten really good, but there are some genuine benefits you get with a physical keyboard for your iPhone. You get more screen real estate when you\u2019re typing, you can use keyboard shortcuts to perform actions in certain apps, and you can have a tactile, physical typing experience. Clicks gives you all of this, and based on our brief hands-on time with it, it seems to do it all quite well.\nThe Clicks Creator Keyboard is already available for preorder for a handful of different iPhone models, with more phones joining soon. It\u2019s quirky, a bit odd, surprisingly useful, and something we can\u2019t wait to try out again soon.\nWithings BeamO\nOne of the best things about CES is seeing unusual gadgets that solve legitimate problems \u2014 and that\u2019s precisely what Withings has delivered with the Withings BeamO.\nThe BeamO is a small handheld device that sort of looks like an Apple TV remote. But this isn\u2019t a gadget for scrolling Netflix or Hulu. Instead, the BeamO is equipped with an electrocardiogram (ECG) reader, oximeter, stethoscope, and thermometer. In other words, you have all the tools you need to keep track of your heart and lung health, plus your temperature.\nHealth gadgets aren\u2019t anything new, but what\u2019s particularly remarkable about the BeamO is how refined it is. The design looks fantastic, your health data is presented on a small LED screen, and you can also view it in greater detail on the Withings mobile app. Withings has been on a roll for a while in the health tech field, and the BeamO is a sure sign that\u2019s not stopping any time soon.\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro\nSmartphones haven\u2019t been a big aspect of CES for years, but that doesn\u2019t mean there weren\u2019t any phones to find at CES 2024. In fact, one of the phones announced at this year\u2019s show \u2014 the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro \u2014 has us really excited.\nWhat\u2019s particularly interesting about the ROG Phone 8 Pro is how different it is from its predecessors. It\u2019s still a big phone with the latest processor and a huge amount of RAM and storage. Asus is also still marketing it as a gaming phone, but it doesn\u2019t really look or feel like one. Gone is the big, bulky, obnoxious design of previous ROG Phones. Instead, the ROG Phone 8 Pro is much sleeker and stealthier while still retaining some unique design elements \u2014 namely AirTriggers for extra controls while gaming, plus a mini LED display on the back.\nThis makes the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro a more practical alternative to the big flagship phones from Samsung, Google, OnePlus, and others. It\u2019s an unexpected shift from Asus, but it\u2019s one we also think will pay off.\nSmart Home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator with AI Family Hub+\nIf you\u2019ve ever slogged through recipe sites on a Tuesday night trying to find a way to whip up dinner with whatever you have on hand, you\u2019ll appreciate what we think is one of the most genuinely useful AI applications at CES 2024.\nThe camera inside the Samsung Bespoke Flex refrigerator uses AI to identify food items, then updates a live list of refrigerator inventory in the Samsung Food+ app. Clever enough. But then it goes a step further and suggests recipes based on both what you have available and dietary restrictions. Put away that box of Kraft Mac & Cheese because you\u2019re making a pomegranate salad with pear vinaigrette. In a year of eyeroll-worthy AI integrations, this is one we can get behind.\nEufy X10 Pro Omni robot vacuum\nIt\u2019s tempting to focus our CES awards exclusively on sparkly concepts, but Eufy made our jaws drop based on something else: value. The $799 X10 Pro Omni boasts almost all the same features as robot vacuums that cost twice as much. That means you get vacuuming and mopping, plus a dock that handles automatic emptying, refilling, and even mop drying to prevent the funk we\u2019ve experienced with earlier robot mops.\nAll that comes at a price that just a few years ago would have been lucky to snag you a competent vacuum alone. And it will be available February 20. This is one we can\u2019t wait to get our hands on for review.\nCES is definitely a laptop show. In previous years, we'd get whole swaths of gaming laptops or laptop manufacturers taking risks with designs. At CES 2024, many of our favorite laptops got redesigned, whether it was slightly tweaking the formula or opting for a radical new direction.\nSo, ignore all the hubbub about AI and just take a gander at these gorgeous and innovative new laptops, which are the best that CES 2024 has to offer.\nHP Spectre x360 14\nThe worst part of owning a pool is trying to keep it clean. Removing debris, scrubbing the walls and floor, and managing water quality is practically a part-time job, making a backyard oasis more hassle than expected. Beatbot hopes to make that a thing of the past with the reveal of the AquaSense Pro at CES 2024 -- a comprehensive robotic pool cleaner that automates most of these processes.\nWhile most competitors will clean either the bottom of your pool or the surface, the Beatbot manages to do both using a chamber that fills with water to sink the bot like a submarine and then empties to float. Using an accompanying smartphone app, you can have the robot clean the floor and walls of your pool, skim debris off the surface, and even improve the clarity of your water by automatically dispensing chemicals based on the size of your pool.\nIt was all about monitors at CES 2024, and we had a chance to see a lot of them. Samsung has exciting new gaming displays, Asus is pushing refresh rates to places they've never gone, and Acer is experimenting with some exciting glasses-free 3D tech. And that's just the products I could fit in a three-item list.\nYes, we saw some exciting monitors at CES this year. Here are the best monitors we had a chance to lay our eyes on.\nLG dual refresh rate OLED\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

Yaber will also exhibit two other newly launched products at the event: the Ace K1 and the Pico T1.\nVicent Wang, CEO of Yaber, commented: \"At Yaber, our mission is to create the most innovative home entertainment projectors for our customers, and the K2s is testament to that.\" He continued: \"The perfect combination of simple and smart, the K2s is easy to use, packed full of features and offers some of the best sound and visuals that money can buy, making it an essential for any home theater.\"\nYaber Unveils World\u2019s First Smart LCD Projector: Yaber K2s at CES 2023\nNext-Generation Home Theater: K2s\nFor those looking for a smart projector, the K2s shines. Easily project video from your phone with NFC technology, then use Amazon Alexa voice control to adjust volume and settings. Plus, Intelligent Screen Adaption technology automatically takes care of focusing and screen adjustment, giving you the perfect picture every time.The Yaber K2s projects 800 ANSI Lumens of brightness, enough to enjoy what you're watching even with background lighting. The built-in independent sound chamber and JBL speakers with DOLBY compatibility cranks out crisp and clear audio whether you're watching movies or gaming. And, with the integrated dongle which gives you access to over 7000 apps, the K2s is one of the smartest, most versatile projectors available.\nProjector Paradise: Ace K1\nAlongside the K2s, Yaber will also present the Ace K1 at CES. The Ace K1 displays stunning visuals, with 650 ANSI Lumens of brightness complimented by a 1080 FHD resolution image. The 150 inches wide projection area also uses Auto Focus and Auto Keystone technology to correct imagery, further adding to the crystal clear quality. Coupled with the 15W speaker, rich colors and dynamic contrast offerings, the K1 brings whatever you're watching to life.\nThe Yaber Ace K1 is built to last too: with a dustproof fully sealed optical engine, dust or particles are prevented from entering the projector, prolonging its lifespan. This means the Ace K1 is the ideal, pocket-friendly projector for everyday use around the home.\nProject Anywhere, Anytime - Pico T1\nYaber gets portable with the Pico T1 - the projector no camping-lover, RV enthusiast or vanlifer should be without. Weighing only 5.3 ounces, the Pico T1 projects an image up to 80 inches wide, making any space a movie theater. The Pico T1 was made for outside the home, but being on the move can mean limited charging opportunities. The Pico T1 is compatible with QC power banks so you can enjoy a movie anywhere anytime.\nWith the option to plug in and play or connect wirelessly, plus an intuitive touch screen for ease of use, this pocket-rocket packs a punch. Plus, with Vertical Auto Keystone to reduce distortion and 110 ANSI Lumens of brightness, the Pico T1 is both small and mighty.\nYou can find the K2s, the Ace K1 and the Pico T1 at Yaber's CES stand #18979 in Central Hall from the 5th January, and Pepcom on the 4th January.\nProduct Availability\nAbout Yaber\nYaber is a world-famous entertainment projector brand founded by Vicent Wang in 2018, dedicated to providing innovative entertainment projectors and creating perfect and immersive audio-visual experiences for everyone.\nBeing a pioneer in the entertainment projector industry, Yaber continuously produces innovative and excellent entertainment projectors which create a better lifestyle by allowing people to get closer to one another.\nFor more information, please visit https://www.yaber.com/\nMedia Contacts:YABER TECHNOLOGIES CO., LIMITEDmarketing@yaber.com+86-755-84829256\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/yaber-unveils-worlds-first-smart-lcd-projector-yaber-k2s-at-ces-2023-301712187.html\nYaber is Launching the Latest Innovative Entertainment Projectors at CES\nYaber Pico T1 Projector Wins Best of IFA 2022 Awards\nYaber Enters New Sales Channel to Accelerate Mass US Entertainment Projector Adoption\nYaber to unveil pocket-sized super slim projector Pico T1 at IFA 2022\nStand with TORRAS, to Empower Phone Users with New Accessories\nVention's Global Outreach Takes a Leap Forward at CES 2024\nTCL Reinforces Its Innovation Leadership with Expanded Product Portfolio and Technical Solutions at CES 2024\nVIOFO to Release VS1-A Perfect Blend of Simplicity and Functionality Packed with Sony STARVIS 2 Image Sensor\nXailient AI Powers Award-Winning Abode Edge Camera at CES 2024\nSUMSEI Develops New Future of Wellness with Body Dryer \"Air Shower\" at CES 2024"
