        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

For pertinent measure changes, review our\u00a0Top 2024 Final MIPS Changes Report.\nData Completeness Threshold\nCost Category\nScoring\nBeginning with 2023, CMS has changed the calculation of the Cost category improvement score* from being measure-based (meaning that only measure-specific improvement would receive a Cost category bonus) to being calculated at the category-level (meaning that overall category score improvement would lead to a Cost category improvement bonus).\n*The Cost improvement score bonus will remain limited to a maximum of 1 percentage point added onto the category performance percent.\nMeasures\nThere are no changes to the cataract measure, the melanoma measure, or the diabetes measure.\nCMS will add five new episode-based cost measures:\nCMS decided to remove the Simple Pneumonia with Hospitalization measure as they are no longer able to assess the cost of pneumonia-related care due to coding changes.\nImprovement Activities\nThere are no significant changes for scoring or reporting this category. There are several changes to the list of improvement activities (IAs), including:\nPromoting Interoperability (PI)\nCMS will increase the performance period to 180 consecutive days (up from 90 consecutive days in 2023) to align with the performance period in the Promoting Interoperability Program for eligible hospitals.\nCMS has finalized the following measure changes beginning in 2024:\nMIPS Value Pathways (MVPs)\nThere are no currently available MVPs relevant to our specialists.\nRecent Posts\nSolutions\nManaged IT Services\nCybersecurity & Compliance\nAdvisory & IT Leadership\nProfessional Services\nGet in Touch\nClient Support\nLet's Talk\nCareers NEW\nContact Us\nLearn More\nAbout Us\nLeadership\nBlog\nFollow Us\nSolutions\nManaged IT Services\nCybersecurity & Compliance\nAdvisory & IT Leadership\nProfessional Services\nGet in Touch\nClient Support\nSchedule a Demo\nCareers NEW\nContact Us\nLearn More\nAbout Us\nLeadership\nBlog\nFollow Us\nANATOMY IT\nCopyright \u00a9 2023.

        "raw_content": "LOGIN / CREATE ACCOUNT\nCMS Releases the 2024 Final MIPS Rule - What Now?\nOn November 2, 2023, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) released the 2024 Medicare Physician Fee Schedule (PFS) Final Rule, which includes updates to the Quality Payment Program (QPP). This blog summarizes the key policy changes affecting the traditional Merit-based Incentive Payment System (MIPS) program, as well as changes in reporting for Alternative Payment Models (APMs) and Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs), and expansion of MIPS Value Pathways (MVPs). While wrapping up your 2023 MIPS reporting should be a priority, it\u2019s also important to stay informed of the upcoming changes that will impact your reporting during the 2024 performance year.\nPerformance Threshold Will Remain at 75 Points\nCMS did not finalize the proposal to increase the performance threshold so it will remain at 75 points for the 2024 performance period (the same as the 2023 performance year). Final MIPS scores are compared to the performance threshold to calculate the MIPS payment adjustment.\nThe table below breaks down final MIPS scores and their associated payment adjustments based on the performance threshold.\n2024 Final MIPS Score\nQuality Performance Category Updates\nHigher Data Completeness Criteria for Quality Measures\nClinicians must meet \u201cdata completeness\u201d when reporting Quality measures to ensure that the data submitted is sufficient to assess quality performance. CMS previously finalized a 75% data completeness threshold for the 2024 and 2025 performance periods (up from 70% in 2023) for electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs), MIPS CQMs, Medicare Part B claims measures, and QCDR measures. This means that Quality measures must be reported on a minimum of 75% of eligible instances for the entire year.\nCMS did not finalize the proposal to increase the data completeness threshold for reporting quality measures in the 2027 performance period. The data completeness threshold will remain at 75% through the 2026 performance period.\nQuality Measure Inventory Changes\nThere are a total of 198 quality measures for the 2024 performance period which reflect:\nCMS also finalized the addition/removal of 2 radiology measures with a one-year delay:\nA list of new measures, along with their collection types, are outlined in the table below.\nA list of measures that have been removed or partially removed is outlined in the table below.\n*These measures would still be available for MVP reporting. Quality measures 112 and 113 would also be maintained for the CMS Web Interface collection type available to Shared Savings Program ACOs reporting through the APP.\nImprovement Activities Category Updates\nThere are 106 Improvement Activities in the MIPS inventory for 2024, including five new activities and the removal of three existing improvement activities as outlined in the table below:\nPromoting Interoperability (PI) Category Updates\nPerformance Period Expanded\nBeginning in 2024, the performance period for the PI Category will increase from a minimum of 90 continuous days to a minimum of 180 continuous days within the calendar year.\nCEHRT Definition Update\nThe definition of Certified Electronic Health Record Technology (CEHRT) is updated toalign with the Office of the National Coordinator for Health IT (ONC) regulations which move away from the \u201cedition\u201d construct for certification criteria. References to the \u201c2015 Edition health IT certification criteria\u201d will be replaced with \u201cONC health IT certification criteria\u201d.\nPI Reweighting Changes\nCMS is discontinuing\u00a0automatic reweighting for the following clinician types beginning in 2024:\nThe agency plans to continue automatic reweighting for the following clinician types in the 2024 performance period:\nPI Measure Changes\nQuery of Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) Measure Exclusion - CMS has modified the current exclusion for the Query of Prescription Drug Monitoring Program (PDMP) Measure to accommodate clinicians who don\u2019t electronically prescribe any Schedule II opioids and Schedule III and IV drugs during the performance period.\nSafety Assurance Factors for EHR Resilience (SAFER) Guides Measure - \u00a0A \u201cyes\u201d response is required to fulfill the SAFER Guide measure beginning with the 2024 performance period.\nUse of CEHRT by APMs\nCurrently, 75% of eligible clinicians in each participating APM Entity must be required under the terms of the APM to use CEHRT in order for the APM to be an Advanced APM. This threshold is removed under the final rule with a one-year delay. Beginning in 2025, Advanced APMs must require the use of certified EHR technology, which means EHR technology certified under the ONC Health IT Certification Program that meets the following:\n(1) the 2015 Edition Base EHR definition, or any subsequent Base EHR definition; and\u00a0(2) any such ONC health IT certification criteria that are determined applicable for the APM.\nCost Category Updates\nCost Improvement Scoring\nThe calculation for the Cost improvement score is updated to ensure that improvement in the Cost category is more accurately scored and aligns with the Quality category scoring improvement methodology. Beginning with the 2023 performance period, the improvement scoring for the Cost category will be calculated at the category level without using statistical significance.\nA maximum Cost improvement score of one\u00a0percentage point out of 100 percentage points is established beginning with the 2023 performance period and a maximum Cost improvement of zero\u00a0percentage points for the 2022 performance period.\nCost Measure Changes\nIn 2024 there will be a total of 29 Cost measures available for CMS to calculate a Cost score. Five new episode-based cost measures are added for the 2024 performance period:\nThe acute inpatient medical condition measure Simple Pneumonia with Hospitalization has been removed for 2024 due to coding changes.\nMIPS Value Pathways (MVPs)\nThere are 16 MVPs available for 2024. This includes five new MVPs for the 2024 performance year:\nModifications are also made to the previously finalized MVPs*:\n*The Promoting Wellness MVP and the Optimizing Chronic Disease Management MVP are combined into one MVP called Value in Primary Care.\nThe Final Rule clarifies that beginning with the 2023 performance period, subgroups will receive their affiliated group\u2019s complex patient bonus, if available. CMS also finalized that subgroups will only receive reweighting based on any reweighting applied to its\u00a0affiliated group.\nTargeted Review Timeline\nCMS will open the targeted review submission period upon release of the MIPS final scores and keep it open for 30 days after MIPS payment adjustments are released. This would maintain an approximately 60-day period for requesting a targeted review.\nAdditionally, if CMS requests information from clinicians under the targeted review process, the information must be provided to and received by CMS within 15 days of receipt of such request.\nAPM Performance Pathway (APP) Reporting Requirements\nCMS Web Interface Sunsets\nCMS did not make any changes to the timeline to sunset the Web Interface. The 2024 performance period will be the final performance year that the CMS Web Interface will be an available collection type for Shared Savings Program ACOs reporting quality measures under the APP. Beginning in 2025, ACOs must report either eCQMs, MIPS CQMs, and/or the new Medicare CQMs.\nMedicare CQMs\nCMS has created a new collection type specifically for ACOs, Medicare CQMs, which can only be reported under the APP. Medicare CQMs are intended to address the data aggregation and patient matching issues Shared Savings Program ACOs experienced when reporting eCQMs and MIPS CQMs under the APP. For the Medicare CQM collection type, an ACO that participates in the Shared Savings Program must collect and report data on only the ACO\u2019s Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries, instead of its all-payer/all-patient population. CMS will share a list of patients eligible for Medicare CQMs with ACOs on a quarterly basis. These lists will include encounters from specific date ranges and be updated each quarter, with the following delivery schedule:\nThese changes aim to reduce ACOs' reporting burden, help them capture all eligible beneficiaries, and allow them to prepare submission data in advance. The quarterly lists will also include beneficiary-level information to assist ACOs in identifying the eligible population for each measure. However, ACOs are still responsible for evaluating their patient population against each Medicare CQM Specification to ensure data accuracy. Multiple data sources can be used to compile measure data, including EHRs, paper records, registries, and patient management systems. The quarterly lists aim to facilitate data aggregation but do not replace the need for a thorough evaluation of the criteria for each measure.\nCMS expects the eventual sunsetting of the Medicare CQM collection type may be paced with the uptake of FHIR API technology, but this will be assessed based on industry readiness and CMS requirements.\nData Completeness Threshold\nThe 75% data completeness threshold will also apply to Medicare CQMs for the 2024-2026 performance years.\nCEHRT Requirements\nCMS is delaying the removal of the CEHRT threshold requirements for Shared Savings Program ACOs by one year. Beginning with the 2025 performance year, CMS will require that all MIPS eligible clinicians, Qualifying APM Participants (QPs), and Partial QPs participating in an ACO, regardless of track, must be on CEHRT. ACOs will have to satisfy all of the following requirements unless otherwise excluded:\nNext Steps\nThe 2024 Final Rule makes several changes to the Quality Payment Program, including reporting under the traditional MIPS program, APM and ACO reporting, and further development of MVP reporting. Clinicians should begin reviewing these changes now so they understand the potential impact on their reporting practices for the 2024 performance year.\n2024 Proposed MIPS Rule 2024 MIPS Final Rule 2024 MIPS Quality Measures 2024 MVPs Medicare CQMs\nLeave a comment\nMore information about text formats\nPlain text\nCREATE ACCOUNT\nBlog Search:\nRecent Posts:\nTopics of Interest:\nRegister with MDinteractive\nCREATE ACCOUNT\nLearn more in our MIPS Overview\u00a0section\nMDinteractive\n800-634-4731support@mdinteractive.com\nCertifications and Surveillance Notice\n*ONC CERTIFIED HIT\u00ae is a registered trademark of HHS.\nCopyrights \u00a9 2023\u00a0MDinteractive \u00ae\u00a0.

Here, you will discover what MIPS is, how it works, why you should care about participating in MIPS, and what recent changes have taken place.\nThis post has been updated since its original publish date.\nWhat Is MIPS?\nThe MIPS Program, established by the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015 (MACRA), is the Medicare payment adjustment program that determines how much your practice will be paid in Medicare payment adjustments.\nApplying a composite performance score, eligible clinicians (ECs) will receive a payment bonus, a penalty, or no adjustment. \u00a0\u00a0Launched on January 1, 2017, MIPS seeks to transform the healthcare industry from a fee-for-service to a pay-for-value trade. It also intends to reduce the administrative burden on ECs and provide greater confidence in their annual payment updates.\nThe Quality Payment Program (QPP), which MIPS has created, consists of two main facets:\nMIPS distills three prior Medicare programs into one: the Physician Quality Reporting System (PQRS), the Value-Based Payment Modifier Program (VM), and the Medicare Electronic Health Record Incentive Program (EHR).\nWhat Does MIPS in Healthcare Stand For?\nYes, there are other \"MIPS\" out there. In a healthcare context, it stands for Merit-Based Incentive Payment System. It is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services' (CMS) original reporting option available to clinicians eligible to receive a MIPS payment. According to CMS, traditional MIPS\u00a0\"was designed to tie payments to quality and cost-efficient care, drive improvement in care processes and health outcomes, increase the use of healthcare information, and reduce the cost of care.\"\nHow Does MIPS Work?\nAs a 100 performance-based points program, MIPS calculates each Medicare Part B clinician's composite performance score (CPS). The four parameters for MIPS scoring and category weights include:\nWhy Should You Care About MIPS?\nMedicare Part B ECs are required to partake in the MIPS program or face a negative 9% payment adjustment on their Medicare payment Part B reimbursements. Provider engagement has decreased from 97% to 90% in the past year. However, the penalties you may face could be imposed by more government regulations or other providers.\nFurthermore, your scoring gets published on physician compare websites. It's always best to start early if your practice is new to MIPS to avoid the risk of penalties.\n2024 MIPS Changes\nOne of the most significant changes in the final 2024 rule is the decision to not increase the penalty threshold hold to 82. The final rule states that the penalty threshold will stay at 75 as it was in 2023. This will be sure to make many ECs happy. The 2024 final rule does not show any changes in how scores are to be measured and points achieved.\n2024 Quality Modifications\nThe Quality Category reporting period remains 12 months, while six quality measures with one high-priority measure still exist for 2024. Concerning the data completeness threshold, 2024 final rule increases the threshold from 70% to 75%. To be compliant and receive max points for each quality measure, ECs must report at least 75% of all eligible instances for the reporting year. It is noteworthy that for future years 2026 and 2027, a proposed rule change will modify that threshold to 80%.\nFurthermore, with respect to the Quality Measure changes for 2024, 198 quality measures are available. Specifically, 13 new quality measures are being added. Eleven were removed, and 59 quality measures were modified. Of the new quality measures, there are three specific to retina specialists that should be taken into account.\n2024 Ophthalmology Quality Measure Changes\nThese are the ophthalmology-related updates as indicated by CMS:\nMeasures finalized for ADDITION to the ophthalmology/optometry specialty set:\nPreviously finalized measures finalized for REMOVAL from the ophthalmology/optometry specialty set:\n\"Substantive change\" to these measures:\n2024 Promoting Interoperability Modifications\nAfter five years of MIPS, for 2024 the final rule increases the PI category reporting period to 180 consecutive days vs. the 90 consecutive days that the program started with. To maintain certification, ECs must still meet the 2015 Electronic Health Record (EHR) Cures Act requirements to report for this category. Additionally, the Query of the Prescription Drug Monitoring Program and the Public Health and Clinical Data Registry for Electronic Case Reporting are still mandatory categories for 2024 rather than elections.\nThe final rule for 2024 MIPS also outlines a new low-volume exclusion for providers who e-prescribe fewer than 100 Schedule II-IV medications. This was not an option in the 2023 Final Rule.\nTake note: Another update in the final rule for 2024 MIPS is the SAFER guides High Priority Assessment is now required to be completed to report the PI Category.\n2024 Improvement Activities Modifications\nThe IA reporting period remains 90 consecutive days. The final 2024 rule will bring in five new improvement activities, and it removed three from the list. Data Validation files for 2024 will need to be reviewed to ensure ECs are properly documenting completion of the chosen activities they attest to completing.\n2024 Cost Modifications\nThe cost category for the 2024 final rule sees very little, if any, changes that will impact ECs. There has been a lot of feedback and conversation regarding the 2022 cost scores that have led CMS to look at improving data file content and better explanation of how to use this data to improve their cost scores.\nIn the 2024 final rule, there are no changes to the current cost measures impacting ECs, and they will be adding five new episode-based cost measures: Depression, Emergency Medicine, Heart Failure, Low Back Pain, and Psychoses and Related Conditions.\nMIPS Value Pathways\nThe 2024 final rule does not show any major changes in the MVP reporting requirements. It is still a voluntary decision for a practice to participate and will need to make this election starting in April of 2024 if they want to participate in MVP reporting. ECs do have the option to report both MVP and traditional MIPS and would receive the higher score of the two.\nSo whether your practice is new to MIPS or seasoned, it is crucial to pay close attention to the changes in 2024. Being an active and current participant in the MIPS program is equally important. Start early and check in with your program often to ensure that you avoid penalties and receive as many incentives as possible.\nLearn More about MIPS and What\u2019s to Come\nLike this article?
