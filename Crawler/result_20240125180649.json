The concept car is VinFast\u2019s first attempt for a pickup truck, exemplifying VinFast's commitment to broadening its product range and promoting sustainable mobility by making smart, safe, exciting electric vehicles accessible to everyone.\nThe VF Wild concept highlights VinFast's innovative efforts to create a pickup truck with exceptional performance, catering to the new generation of consumers looking for innovation and eco-friendliness without compromising on performance and durability.\nWith an overall length of 209 inches (5324mm) and a width of 79 inches (1997mm), VF Wild\u2019s dimensions place it in the mid-size pickup category. This efficiently packaged mid-size footprint is further enhanced by VF Wild\u2019s flexible bed size. The vehicle combines the practicality of a power-folding mid-gate to provide a class-leading bed length designed to expand from 5 to 8 feet with the rear seats folded down automatically, equipping the VF Wild with the largest bed in its segment. With the functionality of the expanding bed, work and play can be done in style and comfort. The design also integrates a panoramic glass roof and digital side mirrors to improve aerodynamics.\nThe VF Wild concept was jointly developed by VinFast and Australian design studio GoMotiv. The design, developed over 8,000 hours and involving many designers, boasts a striking \"Fluid Dynamism\" aesthetic that is uniquely designed for the VF Wild concept, inspired by the flowing motion of a superhero\u2019s cape in the wind.\nVinFast\u2019s brand-new electric vehicle concept was marked with a pivotal naming convention. \u201cWild\u201d represents \u201cthe force of nature\u201d and embodies the brand\u2019s ethos of breaking boundaries to venture beyond and signifies its ongoing commitment toward a green future for everyone.\nMs. Tran Mai Hoa, Deputy CEO of Sales and Marketing, VinFast Global,\u00a0shared: \u201cWe are very proud to introduce the VF Wild\u00a0concept, which encapsulates our mission to make sustainable, high-quality electric vehicles accessible to a broader market.

Sources at VinFast, however, told CleanTechnica during the VinPrize awards last December that, though there is no official announcement of when the pickup is to be released, it may be slated for production towards early 2025, with exports possibly starting in the latter part of that year. This schedule is very fluid because the \u201cacceptance at the CES, with the US being the intended market, may move the schedule earlier.\u201d\n\u201cWe are very proud to introduce the VF Wild concept, which encapsulates our mission to make sustainable, high-quality electric vehicles accessible to a broader market. This is not just a new product in our offering \u2014 it showcases our aspiration to venture into the fast-paced and thriving electric pickup truck market,\u201d said Tran Mai Hoa, Deputy CEO of Sales and Marketing at VinFast Global.\nThe technical specifications are still unconfirmed at this time, but our sources say that the vehicle may come with an already developed and tested, switchable, four-wheel drive system with two motors and will have VinFast\u2019s energy technology that has a tougher battery containment unit.\nThe VF Wild\u2019s design, developed over 8,000 hours, is based on the idea of \u201cFluid Dynamism,\u201d which is an aesthetic that is unique to this vehicle \u2014 inspired by the flowing motion of a superhero\u2019s cape in the wind.\nThis rugged and futuristic design, with a muscular stance, a standout set of alloy wheels, chiseled lines, a prominent front grille, and the proprietary VF headlights and finisher combine to create the ubiquitous pickup silhouette. The truck is also equipped with large off-road tires and plenty of ground clearance.\nIt sites itself in the US mid-size pickup category with an overall length of 209 inches (5324mm) and a width of 79 inches (1997mm). VinFast describes this size as an \u201cefficiently packaged footprint\u201d that can change with its unique \u201cflexible bed size\u201d feature.\nThe flexible bed size \u2014 the most unique feature of the VF Wild \u2014 can be attained by a power folding mid-gate where the rear wall of the cabin folds down, the rear seats along with it, creating a seamless extension of the cargo bed. This gives the truck a lot of versatility for hauling cargo of different shapes and sizes. This expands the rear cargo space from 5 to 8 feet at a touch of a button, effectively equipping the VF Wild with the largest bed in its segment.\n\u201cWith the functionality of the expanding bed, work and play can be done in style and comfort. The design also integrates a panoramic glass roof and digital side mirrors to improve aerodynamics,\u201d VinFast says in a press release.\nThe VF Wild is VinFast\u2019s first attempt at a pickup truck.\nIn 2022, CleanTechnica asked VinFast engineers if the company was looking towards creating vehicles in other categories like sports cars, pickups, and small SUVs and crossovers. They said that with VinFast\u2019s flexible manufacturing facilities and design, it was very easy to go into every segment \u2014 even commercial trucks and vans. They already launched, for release later in 2024, the VF3, a small crossover that may soon reach the US if reports are accurate.\nThe same source from VinFast said that in the product concept development, the US market was the intention for the pickup. But he said that there are other very strong pickup markets just close to Vietnam. He was referring to Thailand and Indonesia, in particular. Both are right-hand drive markets, but with the current engineering processes of VinFast, locating the driver side is \u201cvery simple to do.\u201d\nAccording to VinFast, the VF wild exemplifies its \u201ccommitment to broadening its product range and promoting sustainable mobility by making smart, safe, exciting electric vehicles accessible to everyone adding that the concept highlights VinFast\u2019s innovative efforts to create a pickup truck with exceptional performance, catering to the new generation of consumers looking for innovation and eco-friendliness without compromising on performance and durability.\u201d\nVinFast\u2019s brand-new electric vehicle concept was marked with a pivotal naming convention. \u201cWild\u201d represents \u201cthe force of nature\u201d and embodies the brand\u2019s ethos of breaking boundaries to venture beyond and signifies its ongoing commitment toward a green future for everyone.\nAccording to the designers, the name envisions a future where electric mobility is universally accessible and suitable to difficult terrain. \u201cThe VF Wild encourages customers to break free from the urban routine and fully immerse themselves in the beauty of nature.\u201d\nShare this story!\nRaymond Gregory Tribdino is the motoring & information technology editor of Malaya Business Insight (www.malaya.com.ph) in the Philippines.

        "raw_content": "VinFast bringing pickup concept and tiny VF3 to CES 2024\nIs the brand preparing to take on Rivian?\nVietnam-based VinFast will travel to CES 2024 to unveil a new concept, present an existing model to an American audience, and highlight its range of electric bikes. The company will also announce a round of updates for the VF9, an electric crossover pegged at the top of its range.\nShown above, left of the red VF8, the CES-bound concept remains shrouded in darkness. We see enough to tell that it takes the VinFast design language in a more rugged-looking direction. It sits much higher than the crossovers in the brand's range, its front end is taller, and it looks like it rides on meaty tires. And, note that the back end isn't visible; there's a very good chance we're looking at a pickup.\nIf that's the case, the concept will signal VinFast's intent to take on the Rivian R1T and the Ford F-150 Lightning, among others. The firm is putting a major focus on electric cars, and nothing suggests its truck \u2014 assuming that's what we're looking at \u2014 will get a turbodiesel V8.\nAt the opposite end of the spectrum, the tiny VF3 will make its American debut in the Las Vegas Convention Center. It stretches around 123 inches long, 66 inches wide, and 61 inches tall, so it's merely 17 inches longer than a Smart ForTwo, about as wide, and roughly as tall. The EV was unveiled earlier in 2023, and some of VinFast's American dealers want to see it on our shores. Will they get their wish granted? It's too early to tell. We asked, and we'll update this story if we learn more. An earlier unofficial report floated a base price of under $20,000.\nThe seven-seater VF9, one of the two VinFast models currently available in the United States, will receive a new in-car streaming service at CES 2024. The last bit of news the Vietnamese giant will announce during the annual show is a line of electric bicycles called DrgnFly.\nMore details about VinFast's mysterious concept will emerge in the coming days, and CES 2024 is scheduled to open on January 9.\nRelated Video\nPopular Now\nHertz's Tesla liquidation sale likely means more depreciation for used EVs\nWhat car dealership employees earn: Lots of money\nPorsche Macan EV previewed in official sketches, days ahead of its reveal\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: Sleek new sedan's pricing revealed\n2025 VW GTI revealed: Buttons return but the stickshift retires\nHyundai Palisade spy photos show Ioniq-inspired styling\nFollow Us\nResearch\nPopular Vehicles\nPopular New Vehicles\nPopular Used Vehicles\nPopular Electric Vehicles\nPopular Truck Vehicles\nPopular Crossover Vehicles\nPopular Luxury Vehicles\nPopular Hybrid Vehicles\nPopular Makes\nFeatured Makes\nProduct Guides\nChoose a Display Name\nPlease enter a display name\nSign in to post\nPlease sign in to leave a comment."

        "raw_content": "VinFast Debuts Electric Pickup Concept, Tiny SUV at CES 2024\nVietnamese automaker VinFast took many people by surprise this week by showing a new electric pickup concept called VF Wild at CES 2024 in Las Vegas.\nWe\u2019re talking about a midsize truck that stands approximately 5.3 metres long and 2 metres wide. Weight is not specified but is likely heavier than conventionally powered rivals.\nUnlike the current crop of VinFast SUVs that were designed by Italy\u2019s Pininfarina, including the VF 8 and VF 9, the new VF Wild is the work of Gomitiv, an Australian company. It embodies \u201cFluid Dynamism\" inspired by the flowing motion of a superhero\u2019s cape in the wind, yet at the same time the pickup\u2019s stance, fenders and lower body look pretty rugged to us\u2014skid plates included.\nThe side mirrors are replaced by cameras for the sake of aerodynamic efficiency, while the large windshield blends with the panoramic roof to provide outstanding visibility.\nThe cabin is pretty cool and convenient for many reasons. The doors open in opposite directions and there are no B-pillars, creating easy access to the front and rear seats. What\u2019s more, a power-folding midgate delivers a class-leading bed length designed to expand from 5 to 8 feet with the rear seats folded down automatically.\nVinFast didn\u2019t mention anything about the powertrain or battery (power, torque, payload, towing, range, etc.), but we believe a future production model would use the same dual-motor setup as the 402-horsepower VF 9.\nWhat are the chances the VF Wild does end up on Canadian roads later this decade? We wouldn\u2019t bet against it. Remember, VinFast plans to build a factory in North Carolina for the U.S. market, were pickups are big business as you know.\nSuper-Small VF 3 Coming to North America\nAlso at CES, VinFast hosted the North American debut of a tiny electric SUV called VF 3. The company plans to sell this one on our shores alongside its larger siblings, below the compact VF 6 and VF 7. Early reservations will begin later in 2024.\nEssentially limited to the city, the single-motor VF 3 (output TBD) is projected to offer just 200 km of range. It\u2019s only 3.2 metres long, making it significantly shorter than even a Mitsubishi Mirage. The interior can accommodate four people, while maximum towing capacity is rated at 550 litres\u2026 with the rear seats down. A 10-inch touchscreen is part of the package.\nVinFast promises to share more details and specs later this year. We\u2019ll keep you posted.\nMore on the subject\nDon't miss any updates.Sign up for our newsletter now!\nThe Car Guide is the benchmark of excellence for the Canadian automotive landscape.
