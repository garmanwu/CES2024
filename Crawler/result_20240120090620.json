        "raw_content": "At CES: Electronics Innovations Driving Next-Gen ProductsAt CES: Electronics Innovations Driving Next-Gen Products\nHardware and software advances target future IoT, vehicle, AI apps.\nJanuary 9, 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was for many years a hotbed for innovations in consumer electronics such computers and audio. More recently, products such as smartphones, wearables, and even advanced vehicles have become the darlings of the show. But underneath the glitz of these products are the nuts-and-bolts developments that make these possible\u2500sensors, processors, embedded systems, displays, and other components, as well as software. At CES 2024, innovative hardware and software advances will once again be on display.\nSolar Cell Technology\nAmbient Photonics\u00a0is demonstrating a solar cell technology the company claims can replace traditional batteries for powering remotes, keyboards, speakers, and more. The company has developed a dye-sensitized solar cell (DSSC) that reportedly can deliver up to three times more power than other indoor solar solutions in very low-light conditions.\nThe company\u2019s solar cell technology leverages materials developed through molecular engineering, according to Bates Marshall, co-founder and CEO, in a recent interview with Design News. \u201cWith indoor solar cells, there have been limitations in power density. Some of the other candidate photovoltaic technologies would not be able to justify a large capital investment for only a modest improvement in power handling.\u201d\nMarshall, a veteran of the solar industry, added that Ambient Photonics has already built a plant designed for high-volume solar cell production in Scotts Valley, Calif. He hopes to scale up production to produce cells at a cost that compares favorably with amorphous silicon. Marshall anticipates products integrating the solar cell to be manufactured starting later this year, for applications such as remote controls, keyboards and mice, and electronic shelf labels. One customer is Universal Electronics, a supplier of remote controls.\nDuring CES 2024, Ambient Photonics is demonstrating the abilities of the company\u2019s first bifacial solar cell, which can harvest light energy from the back and front of the solar cell simultaneously. Designed into a remote control, for example, an Ambient Photonics-powered device with a bifacial cell could power itself whether it rests face-up or face-down on a coffee table.\nAmbient Photonics has developed a solar cell technology that reportedly provides three times the power of other indoor solar cell solutions in low-light conditions. (Photo courtesy of Ambient Photonics).\nBecause light power can be harvested from two sides, devices that include Ambient Photonics Low-Light Indoor Bifacial Solar Cell technology can produce more energy, boosting cell efficiency and enabling more powerful electronics. The front side of an Ambient bifacial solar cell delivers 100% of the power that Ambient\u2019s cells are known for, while the back side delivers at least 50% of the energy as the front side.\nTiny Accelerometers\nBosch Sensortec has announced the BMA530 and BMA580, reportedly the world's smallest MEMS accelerometers. Both devices include built-in features making them easy to design with. BMA530 tracks activities with its step counter and is especially suitable for wearables, and BMA580 targets hearables with voice activity detection.\nCompared to Bosch's current generation accelerometer (BMA253), the BMA530 and BMA580 have a 76% smaller footprint and have been reduced in height from 0.95\u00a0mm to 0.55\u00a0mm. This size reduction is achieved with an innovative Wafer Level Chip Scale Package (WLCSP). The small size of the accelerometers makes them easy to place on a PCB, and their integrated features make them easy for design engineers to integrate into their portable products.\nThe BMA580 provides innovative voice activity detection and an advanced feature set for hearable devices. Typically, microphones in hearables consume a lot of power because they need to be always-on to listen for voice activity. Instead, the BMA580 uses bone conduction to detect the vibration of the user\u2019s voice and then wakes the microphone from sleep\u2013for an overall power saving. The BMA580 enables user interaction with a hearable in response to the user tapping the device, for example to answer or end a call. The sensor\u2019s software includes an algorithm that can distinguish between single, double and triple taps.\nBosch Sensortec\u2019s BMA 580 MEMS accelerometers provides voice activity protection and an advanced feature set for hearable devices. (Photo courtesy of Bosch Sensortec)\nIn addition to wearables, the new BMA530 acceleration sensor is ideal for gesture recognition in toys, fall detection in laptops and other devices, and power management functions such as putting a smartphone to sleep when it is not moved.\nBoth accelerometers offer multiple power modes and automatically switch from low-power to high-power modes to extend battery life. They offer a flexible set of connectivity options, including an I3C\u00ae interface.\nWi-Fi 7\nDon\u2019t look now, but Wi-Fi 7 is coming. Ceva, Inc. a licensor of silicon and software IP that enables Smart Edge devices to connect, sense and infer data more reliably and efficiently, is releasing its next generation RivieraWaves Wi-Fi 7 IP platform. The platform further expands the company\u2019s portfolio of connectivity IP, targeting high-end consumer and industrial applications including gateways, TVs, set-top-boxes, streaming media devices, AR/VR headsets, personal computing, and smartphones.\nThe RivieraWaves Wi-Fi 7 IP leverages all the latest advanced features of the IEEE 802.11be standard to deliver a premium high performance, cost- and power-optimized Wi-Fi solution for integration into the next wave of Wi-Fi Access Point (AP) and Station (STA) products.\nWi-Fi 7's 4K QAM modulation scheme is a substantial increase on the previous 1K QAM of Wi-Fi 6, while Multi Link Operation (MLO) introduces dynamic channel aggregation, seamlessly combining heterogenous channels from the same or different bands to navigate interference and boost throughput. Similarly, Multi Resource Units (MRU) enables the creation of larger channel bandwidths by intelligently stitching together punctured or disjointed Resource Units within the same band. The outcome is not only a 5X increase in raw speeds, but also reduced latency, thanks to diminished contentions and retries.\nSoC for IoT\nAtmosic Technologies, a supplier of ultra-low-power wireless platforms for the Internet of Things (IoT), is unveiling the ATM34/e high-performance system-onchip (SoC) series with multiprotocol support. The ATM34/e series adds support for IEEE 802.15.4 based protocols including Thread and Matter, as well as enhanced Bluetooth LE support for the latest 5.4 standard revision. Atmosic\u2019s ATM34/e series is designed for ultra-low power end IoT devices such as sensors and switches and typically uses 50% less active energy than competitor solutions.\nThe SoCs incorporate Atmosic\u2019s best-in-class radio, consuming less than 1 mA in receive mode, and an energy-efficient transmitter with an output power range from -20 dBm to +10 dBm. These power-saving innovations extend battery life in connected devices and can even enable some devices to operate battery-free.\nWith a new scalable memory architecture, the ATM34/e series allows developers to use a memory footprint that meets the needs of their protocol, application, and cost targets. The ATM34/e series integrates a 64 MHz Arm\u00ae Cortex\u00ae M33F processor to optimize power and performance, while also supporting Arm\u2019s TrustZone\u00ae technology for robust security. The ATM34/e series enables devices to efficiently capture, use, and store energy from RF, heat, light, and motion sources. It is designed to support a wide range of storage devices which enables smart sensors and other low power automation applications to operate unattended for years.\nLiDAR On a Chip\nSILC Technologies launched the Eyesonic Vision System Mini, which integrates a multi-channel LIDAR on a single silicon photonic chip and an integrated FMCW LIDAR system-on-chip. According to the company, the system delivers an order of magnitude greater precision while being one-third the size of its predecessor model introduced last year. The precision is expected to be useful in warehouse logistics and AI machine vision applications (see photo).\nSILC Technologies\u2019 Eyesonic Vision System Mini integrates a multi-channel LIDAR on a single silicon photonic chip and an integrated FMCW LIDAR system-on-chip. (Photo courtesy of SILC Technologies)\nAnd Don\u2019t Forget AI\nNot surprisingly, AI-related announcements are in abundance at CES. Toward this end, NVIDIA made a host of announcements. These include the GeForce RTX SUPER desktop GPUs, and NVIDIA RTXTM-accelerated AI software and tools for both developers and consumers.\nThe NVIDIA RTX GPUs are designed to unlock the full potential of generative AI on PCs. The Tensor Cores in SUPER GPUs deliver up to 836 trillion operations per second, bringing transformative AI capabilities to gaming, creating and everyday productivity.\nNVIDIA has also unveiled its GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series graphics cards, including the GeForce RTX 4080 SUPER, 4070 Ti SUPER and 4070 SUPER for top AI performance.\nOther NVIDIA announcements include:\n\u25cf NVIDIA RTX Remix, a platform for creating stunning RTX remasters of classic games.\n.\u25cf NVIDIA ACE microservices, including generative AI-powered speech and animation models, which enable developers to add intelligent, dynamic digital avatars to games.\n\u25cf NVIDIA DLSS 3 with Frame Generation, which uses AI to increase frame rates up to4x compared with native rendering, will be featured in a dozen of the 14 new RTX games announced, including Horizon Forbidden West, Pax Dei and Dragon\u2019s Dogma 2.\n\u25cf Chat with RTX, an NVIDIA tech demo available later this month, allows AI enthusiasts to easily connect PC LLMs to their own data using a popular technique known as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).\nAI and Automotive Processors\nAMD announced its Versal\u2122 AI Edge XA adaptive SoC and Ryzen\u2122 Embedded V2000A Series processors. The Versal AI Edge XA adaptive SoCs add an advanced AI Engine, enabling the devices to be further optimized for numerous next-generation advanced automotive systems and applications including: forward cameras, in-cabin monitoring, LiDAR, 4D radar, surround-view, automated parking and autonomous driving.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: SiLC unveils \"groundbreaking LIDAR technology\"\nAt CES 2024 in Las Vegas, SiLC Technologies (SiLC) has unveiled the Eyeonic Vision System Mini (Eyeonic Mini). The company says it is a groundbreaking advancement in LiDAR technology.\nThe system integrates a full multi-channel FMCW LiDAR on a single silicon photonic chip and an integrated FMCW LiDAR System-on-Chip (SoC), and says SiLC, sets a new industry benchmark in precision.\nUtilising the industry\u2019s first purpose-built digital LiDAR processor system-on-chip (SoC), the iND83301 (\u201cSurya\u201d) developed by indie Semiconductor, the Eyeonic Mini achieves an unprecedented level of detail, delivering an order of magnitude greater precision than existing technologies while being one-third the size of last year's pioneering model.\nThis latest innovation builds upon the success of SiLC\u2019s first commercial FMCW LiDAR system, the Eyeonic Vision System, founded on an integrated silicon photonics chip and designed specifically for machine vision applications.\nSiLC\u2019s Eyeonic Vision Chip, central to the system, amalgamates all essential photonics functions into a coherent vision sensor, delivering a compact solution that meets the demands for performance, affordability and low power consumption. The system\u2019s exceptional accuracy is driven by a 4-channel FMCW LiDAR chip, complemented by indie\u2019s innovative Surya SoC, and equips robots with sub-millimeter depth precision from distances exceeding ten meters.\nThis level of precision opens new doors in automation, particularly in warehouse logistics and AI machine vision applications.\nFor instance, AI-driven palletizing robots equipped with the Eyeonic Mini can fully view and interact with pallets, optimizing package placement and loading onto trucks with efficiency and safety.\nIn the context of the U.S., with its over 13 million commercial trucks, this technology promises to revolutionize warehouse operations and the broader trucking industry, significantly boosting efficiency in loading and unloading processes.\n\u201cOur FMCW LiDAR platform aims to enable a highly versatile and scalable platform to address the needs of many applications,\u201d commented Dr. Mehdi Asghari, CEO of SiLC Technologies. \u201cAt CES this year, we\u2019re demonstrating our long-range vision capabilities of over two kilometers. With the Eyeonic Mini we\u2019re showcasing our high precision at shorter distances. Our FMCW LiDAR solutions, at short or long distances, bring superior vision to machines to truly enable the next generation of AI based automation.\u201d\nGiving robots the intelligence to see, move, touch, think and learn, Dexterity, a leader in robotic warehouseautomation is working on incorporating SiLC technology into its robot autonomy platform. \u201cAt Dexterity, we focus on AI, machine learning and robotic intelligence to make warehouses more productive, efficient and safe,\u201d remarked CEO Samir Menon. \"We are excited to partner with SiLC to unlock LiDAR for the robotics and logistics markets. Their technology is a revolution in depth sensing and will enable easier and faster adoption of warehouse automation and robotic truck load and unload.\"\n\u201cThe Eyeonic Mini represents the next evolution of our close collaboration with SiLC. The combination of our two unique technologies has created an industry-leading solution in performance, size, cost, and power,\u201d said Chet Babla, SVP Strategic Marketing at indie Semiconductor. \u201cThis creates a strong foundation for our partnership to grow and address multiple markets, including industrial automation and automotive.\u201d\nFor machines to be capable of truly augmenting our lives, their vision solution must be powerful, compact, scalable, and unaffected by complex, unpredictable environments and conditions, including interference from other systems. It must provide motion, velocity, polarization, and precision - prerequisites which exclude existing, time-of-flight-based solutions and instead point to FMCW as the needed platform. FMCW technology enables a new generation of imaging solutions that can directly capture images for AI machine vision, factory robots, home security, autonomous vehicles, and perimeter security applications.\nPanasonic PhotoMOS\u00ae Photovoltaic MOSFET High-Power Drivers\nAdam-Tech Wire-to-Board Solutions\nFurther reading\nA selection of Events News articles for further reading"

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: new lidars for old\n10\u00a0Jan\u00a02024\nAeva reveals Daimler Truck as major customer; Cepton and Hesai launch new products; SiLC extends range beyond 2\u00c2\u00a0km.\nAtlas lidar: no active cooling\nAs in previous years, several lidar developers have announced significant developments in technology and commercial traction in conjunction with the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) event in Las Vegas. Here\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s our round-up of the latest news:\nAeva and Daimler Trucks deal\nAs well as the launch of its new \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Atlas\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd lidar aimed at mass-production deployments in the automotive sector, Silicon Valley-based Aeva revealed that it had signed up Daimler Truck as a major customer for the technology.\nUnder the collaboration, Aeva will supply the Atlas systems to Daimler Truck and also work with Daimler\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s software subsidiary Torc Robotics, to enable so-called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Level 4\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd autonomous vehicle capabilities - initially on Class 8 Freightliner Cascadia trucks.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Daimler Truck intends to integrate the lidar sensors directly in its production process, making it easy for customers to buy autonomous ready trucks directly out of its manufacturing plants without the need for sensors to be retrofitted,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Aeva, which announced last week that a production ramp is expected \u00e2\u20ac\u0153by mid-decade\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\nAeva specializes in ultra-compact frequency-modulated continuous-wave (FMCW) lidar that senses both the position and velocity of objects on the road, and said previously that its technology would be replacing older time-of-flight lidar sensors. It expects initial sales revenues for the Daimler deal by the end of March.\nJoanna Buttler, the head of Daimler Truck\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Autonomous Technology Group, said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Together with Torc, we are well on track to offer autonomous trucks to the US market by 2027.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThose trucks are set to be equipped with sensor sets combining FMCW lidar with radar and camera technology. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This enables safe handling adapted to the respective situation on highways, surface roads and ramps, as well as when turning at controlled intersections,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd state the firms.\nAeva CTO and co-founder Mina Rezk said of the latest product launch: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Atlas is the key development that will enable OEMs to equip their vehicles with advanced safety and automated driving features at highway speeds by addressing challenging use cases that could not be solved before.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Importantly, we believe it will accelerate the industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s transition to FMCW lidar technology, which we believe is increasingly considered to be the end state for lidar, offering greatly enhanced perception solutions that leverage its unique instant velocity data.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nCepton claims longer range with 905\u00c2\u00a0nm lasers\nCepton,\nAeva\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Silicon Valley neighbor, also unveiled a new automotive-grade lidar unit at CES. Named \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ultra\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, it is said to feature a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153revolutionary\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd beam-steering technology, dubbed \u00e2\u20ac\u0153MagnoSteer\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Ultra is the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s slimmest adaptive, long-range lidar, designed based on real OEM requirements for next-generation consumer vehicle ADAS and automated driving capabilities,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd stated the company, claiming a range of 300\u00c2\u00a0meters for objects with 10\u00c2\u00a0per cent reflectivity.\nWith a 12\u00c2\u00a0W power rating, the new unit is said to consume less than half the power of typical scanning systems that deliver comparable performance, while taking up just a quarter of the space.\nBrunno Moretti, Ception\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s senior VP of product and commercial operations, added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Powered by MagnoSteer, Ultra breaks the performance bottleneck of 905\u00c2\u00a0nm lidars while taking advantage of a mature, mass-market-ready laser technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nMoretti says that the extended range is thus achieved without the need for fiber laser components operating at a longer wavelength - a technology associated with higher cost and much higher power consumption.\nCompany CEO and co-founder Jun Pei added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153By utilizing our experience in industrializing lidar for mass-market applications, we expect to reduce Ultra\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development time by a third as compared to the past, thereby shortening time to market.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHesai's 'Maxwell' facility in China\nHesai goes behind windshield\nNot to be outdone, China\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Hesai revealed two new lidar products at the Las Vegas event. Rated as a market leader by analysts at Yole Intelligence, the Chinese company is claiming a range performance of 300\u00c2\u00a0meters for 10\u00c2\u00a0per cent reflectivity objects with its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AT512\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd unit - and a maximum range beyond a quarter of a mile.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153This game-changing lidar means AT512 equipped ADAS systems will have 40\u00c2\u00a0per cent more reaction time to avoid dangerous road conditions and significantly improve transportation safety,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says the company, with CEO and co-founder David Li adding:\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our core belief that intelligent manufacturing needs to be part of our R&D efforts has helped us move beyond traditional 1550\u00c2\u00a0nm laser-based lidar to more advanced 905\u00c2\u00a0nm technology as borne out by the superior performance, quality, and reliability of our AT512.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHesai also unveiled its ultra-thin \u00e2\u20ac\u0153ET25\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd product, which is designed to be integrated behind a vehicle's windshield for ADAS applications. It boasts 250\u00c2\u00a0meters of range at 10% reflectivity.\nLi said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153We're already working with leading OEMs to integrate the ET25 into series production vehicles with the start of production planned for Q1 of 2025.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThe Chinese company also says it has now completed construction of its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Maxwell\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd innovation facility - said to feature the world's most advanced lidar testing lab - and adds that it has signed a supply deal with \u00e2\u20ac\u0153one of the world's most revered automotive brands\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to provide its AT128 lidar for a flagship model of electric vehicle.\nSiLC goes beyond 2km with Eyeonic\nSiLC Technologies, which like Aeva is an FMCW lidar specialist, used the CES event to promote the ultra-long-range performance of its \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eyeonic Vision\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sensor - claiming a new world-best of beyond 2\u00c2\u00a0kilometers.\nThe extended performance and precision of Eyeonic is said to be pivotal in applications such as uncrewed autonomous system detection and discrimination, a field where SiLC is collaborating closely with defense-oriented autonomy specialist High Point Aerotechnologies (HPA).\nSiLC CEO Mehdi Asghari said: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our latest achievement with the Eyeonic Vision Sensor is not just about setting new records; it's about enabling practical, real-world applications that require the highest levels of precision and reliability.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our collaboration with HPA to incorporate lidar into their counter-UAS systems is a testament to the versatility and impact of our technology.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHPA\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s CTO, Jeff Maas, added: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153SiLC has made tremendous strides in advancing lidar technology for perimeter security and drone detection.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Their investments in extending range, polarimetry, waveform control, and optical signal processing for the Eyeonic Vision Sensor endeavors to enhance target differentiation of ambiguous targets in clutter-limited environments.
