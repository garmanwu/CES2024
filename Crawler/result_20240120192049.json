The color display allows the rider to\u00a0 clearly see and readily adjust the five-level pedal assist system as well as track speed, driving distance and charging remaining distance. The new model builds on the success of step-through fat tire electric bikes with powerful features, bringing an outdoor mountain biking style to more people.\nIn addition to the Ranger, Ovia and Kommoda models that launched on the official website in November 2022, Cyrusher bikes will also bring Trax, Nitro and Scott. These are three newly-designed electric bicycle models, so stay tuned for their much-anticipated appearance and performance at the exhibition.\nThe organic combination of traditional bicycles with electrification and even smart apps offers\u00a0 powerful functions and gives users more riding pleasure. In addition, the Cyrusher App is in the testing process. This new era of intellectual development, Intelligent systems, technologies and App-assisted riding technologies is also boosting the progress of brand electric bicycles. Before long, expect a more premium version of assistive technology for e-bikes.\nElectrified Products are Flying Down Lanes and Over Waves\nCyrusher will also bring new categories of products for the unique interests of outdoor travel and surfing. They include electric surfboards and electric skateboards. These electrified products aim to meet people's needs for new mobility products and provide move enjoyment when travelling down roadways or over waves.\nAmong them, the brand's electric surfboard is unique. It is driven by a combination of batteries, motors, aviation aluminum propellers and a jet pump direct injection propulsion system. This allows it to generate thrust to lift surfers out of the water and move forward at high speed, with a maximum speed of 65KM/H. It gives people the feeling of flying on the water and\u00a0 the direction and speed of the surfboard is controlled through body swings and other methods.\nServe Travel with Energy Storage Technology\nMany outdoor sports enthusiasts will be looking for some equipment that can store energy to make life more convenient. At the upcoming CES exhibition the Cyrusher team will also bring power solutions suitable for anyone to use anywhere.\nPower stations of various specifications equipped with different plug-in ports, solar panels, etc., are useful for backup power at home, powering camping equipment and so on. The team is working hard to improve people's lifestyles and support their entertainment needs by offering\u00a0 the convenience of clean energy storage technology.\nMost of the products at CES in Las Vegas are \"smart,\" meaning they're better at bringing ease and comfort to life. These interesting devices are designed to make our lives more convenient. The same is true for this energy storage product, which can be taken with you when travelling as an\u00a0 energy source.\nAs we strive to achieve net-zero carbon emissions, stay tuned for Cyrusher's electrified advanced products. The brand's battery-powered high-tech mobility tool and energy storage device is becoming a new trend in low-carbon mobility, offering a fun way to live for a new generation.\nThe 2023 CES exhibition will see inspiring entrepreneurial souls showcasing these high-quality electronic technology products that lead the way in personal mobility in the world. Brand teams understand that\u00a0 attendees are receptive to new products and are eager to see the industry move in this direction to meet the emerging transportation modes of the future.\nAbout CES\nCES is the most influential tech event in the world \u2500 proving a platform for breakthrough technologies and global innovators.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: 5 new tech products stealing the show this year\nThe annual Consumer Technology Show rolled into the Las Vegas Convention Center last week. These are what we think are the most interesting pieces of tech coming from the event.\nWhile the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was dominated by artificial intelligence (AI) embedded into everything from laptops to TVs, tech companies also used the Las Vegas showroom floor to\u00a0highlight other kinds of cutting-edge innovation.\nFrom telescopes perfect for stargazing with friends to a transparent television, the trade show exhibited a range of exciting new gadgets that we expect to hit the market in 2024 and beyond. Here are some of our favorites.\nOdyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes\nUnistellar revealed new Odyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes, which are designed to make stargazing and capturing images of the night sky easier.\nThe telescopes are fitted with 'autonomous field detection technology' that helps stargazers to locate and view astronomical objects. Pairing the telescopes with the Unistellar app (available on Android and iOS) means users with no prior experience can navigate the night sky easily and can save images of observed objects to share with their friends.\nThe new smart telescopes, jointly developed by Nikon and Unistellar, were first announced in 2021 but are only now becoming available to the public.\nFor products that are intended to make skywatching more accessible, both have a hefty price tag, with the Unistellar Odyssey priced at $2,499 and the Unistellar Odyssey Pro at $3,999 \u2014 a premium price even for more advanced telescopes.\nRelated: Best telescopes for stargazing\nLG\u2019s transparent OLED TV\nA see-through TV may not have been on your radar, beyond the odd appearance in science fiction, but LG revealed the completely transparent LG Signature OLED T at CES.\nThis 77-inch TV is designed to blend seamlessly into a room's decor, resembling an art installation more than a classic TV, so you could, theoretically, even place it in front of a window without ruining the view.\nUnlike other concept products, LG actually plans to launch this device, although the company didn't specify a release date or price.\nRelated: 16 tech projects from 2023 that could change the world\nApple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset\nAfter revealing its Vision Pro mixed-reality device in June 2023, Apple used CES to finally announce it will be available to pre-order, with a release date of Feb 2 for customers in the United States.\nThe headset, priced at $3,499, is Apple's first new major product line since the Apple Watch launched in 2015. It augments the real world with a digital overlay, and users can control the device using their voice, gaze and hand gestures.\nWith features like sensors, cameras and built-in spatial audio speakers, the headset also lets users switch between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\nRelated: Best VR mindfulness games\nSwarovski's animal-identifying smart binoculars\nSwarovski Optik showcased the AX Visio, a pair of smart binoculars, that can identify different species of animals and insects \u2014 perfect for wildlife enthusiasts.\nThe 10x32 binoculars use built-in AI to identify species of birds, insects and mammals, showing you the name of that species when you lock onto the creature in the viewfinder.\nThere is also a dial in the middle to switch between animal identification, a compass and even a 4K camera setting. Users can store around 1,700 photos or one hour of video in full quality, which you can then download to smartphones or devices.\nThe high-tech binoculars will be unsurprisingly expensive,\u00a0costing $4,799 when they are released in\u00a0February.\nRelated: Best binoculars for wildlife spotting 2024\nThe HRM-Fit sports bra heart rate monitor\nGarmin announced a new $149.99 heart rate monitor at CES called the HRM-Fit. It's designed for people to attach to sports bras from a wide range of manufacturers, including Adidas and Athleta. It can capture training data like ground contact time balance and stride length, as well as real-time heart rate, without compromising movement or performance.\nThe device then transmits this information to other fitness devices like Garmin smartwatches or Edge cycling computers, as well as compatible fitness apps like Tacx Training.\nUsers will need a compatible Garmin device to get the most out of the HRM-Fit, but even without one, the HRM-Fit can capture information on steps, calories burned, intensity minutes and all-day heart rate.\nRelated: Best fitness trackers 2024\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nOrla is an NCTJ-trained journalist with a background in beauty, lifestyle and technology commerce journalism and has worked for leading titles such as The Mirror and MailOnline.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "Cyrusher at CES 2023: Electrification Changes the Future of the Industry\nSHENZHEN, China, Jan. 16, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Due to the pandemic, many well-known corporations were absent from the 2022 CES. But in 2023 \u2014 the year of significant technological product launches \u2014 CES was once more at its finest. Leading technology companies gathered in this arena to showcase the latest technological advancements and cutting-edge trends.\nCES opened in Las Vegas on January 5th. For the first time, exhibitor Cyrusher attended and offered products that were favorably welcomed by suppliers and guests from around the world throughout the exhibit. This article outlines the latest news from Cyrusher at CES 2023.\nThe latest news of Cyrusher at CES 2023\nCyrusher is exhibiting a wide range of products developed in the following categories\n(1) Fat tyre electric bikes\n(2) Electric skateboards & surfboards\n(3) Energy storage batteries\nExhibitors showed a high level of enthusiasm for Cyrusher's fat tyre ebikes, with many guests on hand to take a test ride and learn more. Additionally, staff on site handed out new customized product brochures, revealing the new models that Cyrusher will be putting on sale in 2023. Moreover, Cyrusher revealed two products in a new field for the first time \u2014 the electric surfboard and skateboard, adding fuel to the electrification craze. Guests were treated to a dazzling display of electrification products as the powerful performance of the portable power station was also showcased. The following article will guide customers through the details of Cyrusher's latest products.\nBreakthroughs in the new field - electric skateboards & electric surfboards\nCyrusher publicly revealed its new products: the electric surfboard and skateboard. The electric skateboard is a product that offers advantages for short distance travel. It is an extension of the motorization of traditional skateboards. An electric skateboard is the favoured option for short-distance travel since it provides a faster and more energy-efficient alternative to a traditional one and is more portable than an electric bike. It is a lightweight mobility tool that can be easily carried on subways and buses. Furthermore, by adopting various playing postures that are more aesthetically pleasing, the skateboard may be employed as a more relaxed and cool kind of entertainment.\nThere is also a growing interest in electric surfboards in the water sector. These are motor-driven models that offer a quieter surfing acceleration\u00a0 and can bring surfers a more exciting surfing experience. Cyrusher uses advanced technology to provide an ergonomic and beautifully crafted electric surfboard. It uses a direct jet pump propulsion system to help customers paddle through the water with ease. Thanks to the ergonomic design, the board offers a high level of stability and excellent maneuverability. It provides great lift and control to help customers ride the waves and pursue a more thrilling surfing experience. The powerful motor of the electric surfboard can provide a peak speed of up to 65 km/h. With its bearing capacity of up to 100 kg, it enables more surfers to enjoy the fascination of catching waves.\nThe professional sector lights up the whole venue - Electric bikes\n2022 Classic hot-sale models - Good quality, Powerful and Popular\nKommoda, Ranger and Ovia were three popular models that were on display at CES and available for test rides. All the models were a tremendous hit for with customers visiting the exhibit.\nBoth the Kommoda and the Ovia are step-through bikes that provide a very pleasant and effective riding experience while suiting the majority of riders' body shapes. The full suspension, fat tyres and powerful motors are all included in both models. To make the entire ride smoother and more pleasant, the Ovia features an upgraded air suspension system and improved battery range.\nThe Ranger is the newest flagship product, an all-terrain mountain bike with greater options for various riding scenarios, it offers a balance between comfort and stability. The powerful Ranger is the ideal travel partner that can take customers on any exploration.\nAll three models are available for sale on the Cyrusher official website, so if customers are interested, check out the page for more detailed specifications.\nNewly launched 2023 model - Better, Stronger, and More Popular\nAt the show Cyrusher presented the new models that will be available in 2023. They adhere to the design tenet of \"better, more powerful and more popular\" to create products that are better suited to customers' demands in terms of model and attractive appearance. With better performance, the newly launched products offer riders a more stable and enjoyable riding experience.\nThe first Cyrusher mid-drive electric cycle - the Nitro\nIn 2023, Cyrusher will break new ground by releasing the Nitro, the first mid-drive motor model, ahead of schedule. The mid-drive motor is considered to be the best drive motor, offering a smoother ride and a richer source of power. Cyrusher will include it in the design of the Nitro in 2023, making the switch from a rear-hub motor to a mid-motor to give customers the best riding experience. The Nitro is the most anticipated mid-motor model of 2023 since it also has a high-capacity battery, full air suspension and hydraulic brakes.\nThe step-through electric bike with wider saddle - the Scout\nMany Cyrusher riders preferred a wider saddle design; thus, the Scout was created as a solution. Not only does it have a wider saddle to satisfy customer demand, the Scout follows the step-through design, offering a more practical and comfortable transport alternative for a wider range of users. The Scout will be available with a 52V 20Ah battery capacity and air suspension for a smoother ride, so the update to the saddle does not compromise performance.\nA powerful all-terrain electric bike - the Trax\nAlthough the powerful Ranger that is currently available is a blessing for the taller rider, the Trax was built so that more riders may enjoy the comfortable riding the Ranger provides. The Trax has four colour options to accommodate the rider's creative demands while providing the same crucial functionality as the mighty Ranger.\nCyrusher is constantly striving to enhance the rider's experience with better-performance products for increased comfort, stability and safety. The three recently revealed models show that this is the truth. The e-bike market is evolving with refined designs resulting in more beneficial developments. In terms of carbon emissions, the e-bike sector is replacing conventional fuel-fired models, paving the path for a green society.\nThe green energy solution - Portable power stations\nCyrusher has always been committed to solving many potential problems such as those relating to power needs, hence the creation of the Crafuel portable power station. It is available in different product categories, such as portable power stations and solar panels. The power station can ensure a safe power supply for the home, office and even some professional industrial applications. The sine wave inverter of the power station can ensure a safe power supply for sensitive equipment such as laptops and smartphones without causing damage. It may be utilized for household backups as well as for a continuous power supply during situations like severe weather.\nAbout Cyrusher\nA specialized manufacturer, Cyrusher was founded in 2014 with the goal of introducing e-bikes to more users, improving personal mobility\u00a0 and lowering society's carbon footprint. The company is committed to providing riders with a cost-effective product that is in line with the ever-changing market laws. With innovation serving as the competitive advantage of the business, Cyrusher is continually upgrading its product lineup to better meet the demands of riders. In 2022, Cyrusher will bring the portable power station to the public and promote a more portable lifestyle. Furthermore, the company will keep growing its line of products, extending the concept of electrification to a wider range of products that will change personal lifestyles and promote a green and healthy society.\nIs electrification the future of the industry?\nElectrification is becoming an irreversible trend in the industry as consumer demand and government initiatives are driving a shift towards electrification and greener forms of electric energy storage, in line with society's zero-carbon plans. Whether it's an electric bike, electric skateboard or electric surfboard, Cyrusher is offering new options for electrifying the personal mobility sector. The advancement of society's zero-carbon objectives is having a beneficial impact on the design of Cyrusher's products and Cyrusher's exploration of new categories will continue to propel the electrification sector ahead. The virtuous drive shared by the company and society is giving fresh impetus to the future of the industry.\nCyrusher consistently diversifies its business while impressing clients.

While you can certainly buy some of the wares at the show, some of the most intriguing tech concepts trumpeted at CES are visions of the future we wish were already real. (Others were straight-up wacky.) Here's what's sparking our imagination.\nTalking, color-changing BMW\nRemember KITT, the talking car from Knight Rider? It's getting closer to reality thanks to Dee, a talking, color-changing BMW concept car displayed at CES. It will listen and respond to commands from curbside, as well as remotely via a smartphone app. Plus, the concept's exterior skin is covered with new full-color E Ink technology that can instantly shift between up to 32 colors, allowing you to generate patterns and multicolor schemes on the fly to customize your ride.\nSelf-service airport screening pods\nAirport security lines are never fun, and they can be so long they result in travelers missing their flights. Thankfully, the Transportation Security Administration is testing a new self-service system that could let you complete the screening process on your own. The self-service screening pods are for TSA PreCheck passengers to use as individual screening consoles. When a passenger steps inside the screening pod, they show their ID and the machine will begin scanning them and their bags. Each station includes a video monitor with step-by-step instructions. The prototype that's being shown at CES this week is the Micro-X self-screening system.\nJackery solar Mars bot and rooftop camper\nJackery displayed two concept items -- one more practical than the other. The company showed off a \"Mars rover\" with solar panels. The Solar Generator Mars Bot is like a portable power station on wheels with solar panels sliding out of the sides to capture more sunlight, somewhat like NASA's Opportunity Rover, with power outlets. And a more practical item on display was the company's rooftop camper tent. Solar panels mounted inside the hardshell roof of the pop-up tent and extending wings of panels can provide power through one of the company's power stations, running plenty of camping equipment for long journeys.\nKia's Lego-like concept vehicles\nKia debuted three concept vehicles at CES 2024: the PV1, PV5 and PV7, the automaker's new Platform Beyond Vehicle family. They are electric vans that can be customized to move products, serve as work or living spaces, be converted to modular pop-up stores, and operate with or without a driver behind the wheel. Think Legos for vehicles -- they can be reconfigured almost at will.\nHyundai's steering tech\nThe Hyundai Mobion concept vehicle moves unlike any other vehicle you've probably seen. The newly developed eCorner steering technology uses advances in robotics technology to allow the vehicle to move laterally, rotationally, and do all sorts of crazy things. The wheels can be moved independently, but also in multiple different configurations. The car can even crab walk, and it can do rear-wheel steering on a level that we've almost never seen before. Hyundai hopes to begin shopping the tech around in 2025 or so.\nQuantum dot-powered TV of the future\nNanosys has created a prototype 12.3-inch nanoLED screen that could be thinner, brighter and more efficient than OLED. What's nanoLED, you ask? It's a technology based on electroluminescent, aka \"direct-view\" quantum dots, and its screens boast improved picture quality, energy savings and manufacturing efficiency. While the screens can't quite be made in TV size yet, the new prototypes are big enough for tablets, small laptops and automotive uses.\nHyundai's electric air taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the CES debut of the Supernal S-A2. Hyundai's advanced air mobility wing Supernal displayed its new, second-generation S-A2, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, air taxi. It'll take to the air as early as 2028, the company said.\nDoublepoint Android watch software\nA Finnish startup created some impressive software, called Doublepoint, that turns your smartwatch running Android's WatchOS into a kind of remote control you can wear on your wrist.\nIt makes your watch a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection. You may be able to dim your lights, scroll Netflix or do any number of other things.\nHisense projector concept car\nHisense doesn't make cars, but the company is demonstrating its laser TV in-car technology at CES. CNET's\u00a0David Katzmaier calls it\u00a0\"basically a drive-in movie theater built into your car.\" There's a laser projector right on the front bumper -- you could project a movie straight from your car onto a flat surface, like your garage door. Inside the car, you can turn the windshield into an information hub, allowing drivers to simultaneously observe virtual images and the real environment.\nSamsung transparent micro-LED\nTransparent OLED\u00a0and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, but Samsung says its micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the going tech. That means you should be able to see through it more easily to objects on the other side.\nOne intriguing use: One day, you could be in a luxury box at an athletic event or concert looking through this transparent micro-LED glass. Scores, replays and highlights could appear on the \"windows\" and augment the experience of the game without obscuring it. (You're still on your own for getting those luxury box tickets, however.)\nSamsung's flip phone concept\nSamsung's Flex In & Out Flip concept is like a Galaxy Z Flip you can fold in both directions. Unlike the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and other flip phones you can buy today, it folds completely backward so that you use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nLG DukeBox\nIf you've ever wanted to sync up The Wizard of Oz with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, the LG DukeBox might be just the device for you. It's a 360-degree speaker with a transparent OLED panel at the front to show off the tube amplifier inside. LG says the screen can be used to watch movies or \"create a cozy fireplace ambiance where the vacuum tube is visible amidst the flickering flames.\"\nLG concept car\nLG has a car? It's just a concept for now, but this futuristic beauty features completely autonomous driving, seats that turn completely around, and of course, plenty of screens. It also works with LG's smart home system, and there's a video game system and concierge station that holds a wine bottle. AR displays give you information on businesses you're passing as the car drives you around.\nSamsung rollable OLED\nImagine\u00a0Samsung's flexible rollable OLED display technology\u00a0inside your car. These screens offer small, unobtrusive displays when you're driving, but when you need to charge your electric vehicle, you can fold out the screen to a larger size for movie watching or playing games. It folds right back up to the size of a chunky highlighter when you're done.\nStained glass solar panels\nThink you know what solar panels look like? Think again. This crystal isn't just an art object but a solar panel capable of turning sunlight energy into power. Extra points for not looking like a giant, unsightly black box.\nProject Esther gaming chair cushion\nRazer showed off its new Sensa HD Haptics technology with a concept for a gaming chair cushion. Project Esther, an add-on cushion unveiled at CES, is the first demonstration that Razer has offered of the new technology, which comes via its acquisition of Interhaptics in 2022. It straps on to a chair and creates sensations to let you feel as if you're really experiencing the game you're playing.\nPanasonic's novel solar cells\nPanasonic has a plan to one day turn walls and windows into solar energy. The new solar technology, perovskite, uses different materials than traditional silicon solar panels. The fact that the materials are printed onto walls and windows means Panasonic can manufacture components at much lower temperatures -- which saves energy -- and the solar cells themselves have the potential to one day capture as much energy as traditional solar panels, if not more.\nHonda 0 Series Saloon\nHonda gave CES attendees their first peek at its next generation of battery electric cars, the Honda 0 (pronounced \"zero\") series, expected to launch in the US in 2026. Shown here is the\u00a0sharply styled 0 Series Saloon, the flagship model.\nIt will be joined by the more upright and van-shaped Honda 0 Space-Hub, featuring a transparent canopy and center-facing bench seats.\nMore Galleries\nSteak Toasters, Indoor Smokers and Robot Cocktails: All the Kitchen Tech of CES 2024\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nThe Rabbit R1 AI Assistant Looks Downright Retro in Orange\nOnePlus 12 and 12R Have an Elegant but Familiar Design\nSamsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra Now Has a Titanium Design\n17 Hidden iOS 17 Features and Settings on Your iPhone"

It\u2019s the red-and-white facade of a QTS data center, positioned at the gateway to Northern Virginia\u2019s Data Center Alley.\nFor QTS Data Centers, the visual prominence of the Shellhorn-DC1 building tracks with the company\u2019s emergence as a leading player in hyperscale infrastructure. The QTS growth story has been powered by two prevailing trends: the growth of hyperscale computing and the consolidation in the data center sector.\nIt\u2019s been just four years since QTS overhauled its business to focus on the hyperscale market, shedding a managed services business and in-house cloud offering. Backed by the financial strength of Blackstone, which acquired QTS last year for $10 billion, the company is now competing for \u2013 and winning \u2013 some of the largest hyperscale deals.\nAs a private company, QTS no longer issues public updates on its performance. But third-party reporting has highlighted the company\u2019s success in Hillsboro, Oregon, where it is supporting a large new data center campus for Meta. A regulatory filing reveals that QTS and utility PGE are seeking 250 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity to support the multi-building Meta project.\nWhile the precise details of the Meta deal are not public, it is without a doubt one of history\u2019s largest wholesale data center deals.\nQTS has also seen leasing success in Ashburn, where demand from large customers has helped populate the 42-megawatt Shellhorn-DC1 data center, and prompted the construction of an identical facility next to it.\nThe project displays the company\u2019s ability to deliver capacity quickly, as QTS was able to transform the site from dirt to a fully-commissioned data center in seven months during one of the toughest periods of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSpeed Matters for Hyperscale Builds\nThe 310,000 square foot Shellhorn DC-1 was cited as Data Center Construction Project of the Year in the Northern Virginia Technology Council\u2019s 2021 Data Center Awards.\n\u201cQTS has rapidly established itself as a leader in the Ashburn data center development community,\u201d said Buddy Rizer, Executive Director, Loudoun County Department of Economic Development. \u201cWe welcome its economic contributions and appreciate the partnership with county staff that allowed them to create the new state-of-the-art Ashburn-Shellhorn data center that is the fastest ever data center built in Northern Virginia.\u201d\nPower and cooling equipment in a gallery running alongside a data hall in the QTS Shellhorn DC-1 data center. (Photo: Rich Miller)\nThere have been other projects in the region that have been deployed quickly \u2013 notably the CyrusOne Sterling II project, which was built in 6 months in 2016 \u2013 but few have faced the challenges confronted by QTS in 2020. The Shellhorn project was part of a building boom in Loudoun County as hyperscale providers raced to provision capacity to meet intense demand for cloud services as COVID-19 precautions shifted school, work and entertainment to an online delivery model.\nThe Shellhorn project is one of the first data centers delivered using the QTS Freedom Building Design, which was created to combine a standard design with smart logistics. QTS says the design helps it deliver data centers faster, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to the requirements of hyperscale and cloud operators, who now account for more than 50% of the company\u2019s business.\nThe QTS Journey: Retrofits to Hyperscale\nQTS was founded in 2005 by Chad Williams as Quality Technology Services, operating a single data center in Kansas. Williams continues to serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Office of QTS, but the company now operates more than 7 million square feet of data centers in in 20 markets across North America and Europe, including large data center campuses in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta and Oregon.\nIn its early years, the company was known for retrofits of mega-scale industrial facilities to create large data centers. In 2018 QTS shifted its development focus to the largest customers in the hyperscale market, a move that coincided with the opening of the company\u2019s first facility in Ashburn, the leading market for cloud infrastructure.\nThat strategy was gaining momentum at the onset of the pandemic, which prompted more customers to embrace the remote management tools in the QTS Service Delivery Platform (SDP), which provides customers easy access to more cameras, sensors and KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) management tools. This allowed QTS to offer customers options while restricting their access to facilities.\nThe success of SDP is among the factors that impressed Blackstone, the world\u2019s largest alternative asset manager, as it sought to invest in digital infrastructure. .\n\u201cQTS aligns with one of Blackstone\u2019s highest conviction themes \u2013 data proliferation \u2013 and the required investment makes it well suited as a long-term holding for our perpetual capital vehicles,\u201d said Greg Blank and Tyler Henritze, Senior Managing Directors at Blackstone.\nWhy The Freedom Design Matters\nQTS broke ground on the Shellhorn project on June 1, 2020, and completed the space with fully-commissioned power in place on Dec. 31. The company says the shift to the Freedom Design was key in accelerating its delivery. The design was a response to the speed of hyperscale expansions, and brought together the design and logistics teams to streamline their processes and timelines.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a flexible setup that works with interchangeable vendors,\u201d said\u00a0James RePass, the Vice President of Facilities Operations at QTS. \u201cIt allows us to drive to a custom solution within a standard product.\u201d\nThe design employs an N+1 approach to power infrastructure, featuring power pods that include a 1.5-megawatt UPS and switchgear, backed by a 2.25-megawatt generator. Standardizing the design enabled QTS to build its UPS rooms offsite in a factory in Louisiana, where the production line can operate continuously and direct finished pods to each new project as needed.\nThe equipment yard of QTS Shellhorn DC-1, filled with power pod infrastructure, with a view of the frame for the next 42-megawatt data center planned for the campus. (Photo: Rich Miller)\nThirty two of these pods are deployed along the length of the Shellhorn facility, supporting a flexible design for the 170,000 square feet of data halls inside the building, which can be configured to be as large as 10.5 megawatts.\n\u201cYou can right-size deployments from the start,\u201d said RePass. \u201cThe underlying base design allows almost anything the customer wants to do, even with high-density air cooling.\u201d\nThe Road Ahead: Competing at Scale\nThe Freedom design is also being used in Hillsboro to deliver the massive campus for Meta. It\u2019s one of the first major deals since the completion of the Blackstone acquisition in August 2021, which set off a ripple effect of data center M&A, and may serve as a prototype for how investors can accelerate the growth of privately-held data center developers.\nBlackstone is among the large investors focused on the data center industry and the growth of the digital economy. With more than $684 billion in assets under management, Blackstone provides QTS with extraordinary resources to fund data center construction and management technology, a network of potential partners and customers across Blackstone\u2019s investment universe.\nThe placement of QTS within Blackstone\u2019s perpetual funds is strategically important, as these funds focus on long-term holdings, unlike targeted funds that typically seek returns within a specific timeframe. That matters in cloud computing, where tenants want development runway for long-term growth. Blackstone\u2019s backing means QTS can pursue the land and construction financing to make that happen.\nBlackstone\u2019s backing means QTS can pursue the land and construction financing to create long-term runways for data center growth.\nNorthern Virginia is an example. QTS has room to grow on its campuses in Ashburn and Manassas, but is also looking to secure up to 800 acres of land in Prince William County as part of the Digital Gateway project, which would create a massive data center district near one of the area\u2019s Civil War battlefields. QTS has not publicly discussed the details of its proposal, but says it will pursue \u201ca thoughtful development strategy that will preserve the historical significance and aesthetic beauty of the area.\u201d\nQTS is also building a connectivity strategy to enable a shift away from traditional data hubs in major markets, as cloud players seek favorable economics and room for long-term growth for network infrastructure. Amazon Web Services recently deployed components of its network infrastructure in QTS data centers in Chicago, Atlanta, and Piscataway, N.J.\nThe AWS regional deployments align with the QTS\u2019 ambitions to decentralize network architecture, moving beyond the traditional interconnection model. in which network hubs in the central business district large of major cities are the center of gravity for interconnection.\nSean Baillie, Executive Vice President, Connectivity at QTS, says that growing clouds need more equipment space than is easily available in carrier hotels, which are often downtown towers with limited floor plates.\n\u201cI think that this is a validator that we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d said Baillie. \u201cThis is going to change the nature of big network exchanges in major US markets.\u201d\nThe markets for hyperscale computing and interconnection services remain intensely competitive. With an experienced team, streamlined design and strong financial backing, QTS has navigated the fast-moving trends shaping digital infrastructure, positioning itself to be a bigger builder of the clouds to come.\nRich Miller\nContinue Reading\nThe Eight Themes That Will Shape the Data Center Industry in 2024\nQTS Data Centers Makes $1 Billion South Carolina Debut Amid Busy 2023\nSponsored Recommendations\nThe NFPA 70B Standard Just Got an Overhaul.
