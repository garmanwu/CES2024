Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: Everything you need to know about the camera and tech showcase\nThe world's biggest technology show, CES 2024 is taking place in Las Vegas next week.\u00a0What camera kit will be there?\nCES 2024, the biggest technology event in the world, is taking place next week \u2013\u00a0and it's going to be the site of some huge announcements in the world of electronics.\nAs always (at least, when there's not a pandemic), CES 2024 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada and runs from January 09-12. Last year saw 117,000 visitors and 3,200 exhibitors at the event, including the biggest technology giants such as Google and Microsoft.\nOf specific interest to us, of course, are the imaging giants who are participating at this year's show: Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Adobe. While CES 2024 is a general technology showcase, not one dedicated to photography or videography in specific, it has been used as a launchpad for cameras and imaging tech. And with both video and AI being cornerstones of this year's event, we're sure to see some exciting launches.\nFull details on the show can be found at the CES website.\u00a0For now, here's what we're excited about and what we expect to see\u2026\nWhen is CES 2024?\nCES 2023 will take place in its traditional home of Las Vegas, Nevada, running from Tuesday January 09 to Friday January 12.\nThe event emanates from the Las Vegas Convention Center. If you're in the area, attendance details are on the CES website.\nWhat do we expect at CES 2024?\nSony\nWord has it that Sony could announce five cameras this year, among them the Sony A1 II, A7S IV, FX3 II and ZV-E10 II. With all of these featuring headline video capabilities, it would certainly be the right time and place to debut at the video-obsessed CES.\nPersonally I think it's waaaaaay too early for a Sony A1 successor, though with a new rumor that the company could replace the Sony A7S III (and the A7S line altogether) and the Sony FX3 with the FX3 II, this feels like a new pillar that would be well-cemented in Las Vegas.\nPanasonic\nThere's been plenty of chatter about replacements for the Panasonic S1 / S1R, Panasonic S1H and Panasonic GH6. And given that the company launched the Panasonic S5X and S5 IIX last January, it's entirely possible that an S1R II, S1H II and GH7 could be revealed at CES 2024.\nOf course, as a general tech giant, we could see plenty of other adjacent imaging breakthroughs. At last year's show Panasonic announced \"life changing\" smart glasses, made in conjunction with Biel Glasses, using AI to help users with impaired vision.\nHeck, maybe we might finally see Panasonic announce something 8K-related\u2026\nCanon\nWill CES 2024 be the launchpad for the highly anticipated Canon EOS R1? We all know that the new flagship is on the way, and that it's intended to launch in time for the Paris Olympics, so time is running out for Canon to show it to the world.\nThere are plenty of other possibilities, too. The Canon EOS R5 II feels a little ambitious, but Canon has a habit of showcasing its latest collection of concept cameras \u2013\u00a0many of which have made it to market, such as the Canon PowerShot Zoom and Canon PowerShot Pick. These are always fascinating glimpses into the future, and I'm excited to see what's on show this year!\nNikon\nAfter a knockout year in 2023, Nikon could capitalize by taking the bull by the horns early in 2024. The likeliest candidate to me would be the Nikon Z6 III, which is widely expected to be here any minute.\nThere has also been a wild rumor about a Nikon Z9H \u2013\u00a0a speed-oriented version of the Nikon Z9. The \"H\" is ostensibly a nod to the suffix Nikon used to give to its flagship cameras to denote particular performance specialisms \u2013\u00a0such as the Nikon D1H, which was a speed-oriented upgrade of the base D1.\u00a0Personally I'll believe this one when I see it!\nFujifilm\nThis feels like a bit of a long shot, as Fujifilm is usually more at home announcing products on its home turf at CP+. That said, with reports that the manufacturer will launch more cameras in January alone than it did in 2023 as a whole, a launch or announcement isn't out of the question.\nWhat could this be? Well, a follow-up to the Fujifilm X100V is widely expected \u2013 and given what a blockbuster success that camera was, it could be a good fit for the broader-appeal of CES 2024. An outside chance would be the Instax Mini 99, which sounds like it might be a disruptive product.\nCES 2024 announcements\nLaCie Rugged Mini SSD\nThe palm-sized LaCie Rugged Mini SSD has been announced in capacities up to 4TB offering IP54 dust and rain resistance, 3-meter drop protection and 1-ton car pressure resistance.\u00a0No need to baby your portable SSD any more!\nLaCie claims write speeds of up to 2000MB/s, with USB 3.2 gen 2x2 and compatibility with USB 40Gbps, USB 10Gps, Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts including the latest Apple iPad, iPhone and Macbooks. Prices start at $79.99 for 500GB and go up to $349.99 for 4TB.\nFull story: LaCie adds to its famous Rugged lineup with a new palm-sized SSD\nWith a good few days to go until the event kicks off, there will be plenty more news, announcements and leaks between now and doors opening.

        "raw_content": "InfiRay P2 Pro and TOPDON TC001 Thermal Cameras Capsule Review\nThe consumer thermal camera market was opened up in the late 2010s by the launch of Seek Thermal's first offering and FLIR's FLIR ONE / FLIR ONE Pro. These had comparatively high resolutions of 206x156 and 160x120, which allowed the companies to further cut down the cost of follow-up products with lower-resolution sensors. US regulations prevent these cameras from offering videos with frame rates higher than 9 Hz, but that is often plenty enough for a wide variety of consumer use-cases such as home inspection (both electrical and plumbing), rodent control etc. The last couple of years have seen a new crop of thermal cameras from Asian vendors that don't seem to be subject to frame rate limitations. Two vendors - InfiRay and TOPDON - reached out with review samples of their consumer-focused smartphone-attachable thermal cameras. This capsule review provides a comparative look at the features of the InfiRay P2 Pro and the TOPDON TC001, with a focus on the user experience aspect.\nIntroduction and Product Impressions\nInfiRay is the brand name under which products manufactured by IRay Technology Co. are being marketed. The company has been in operation for the last decade and claims many patents related to thermal imaging. The company designs and manufactures its own thermal imaging sensors using microbolometer infrared focal plane array technology. The basics of microbolometer sensors have already been covered in our previous thermal camera reviews, and are not being repeated here.\nThe P2 Pro is an ultra-compact smartphone-attachable thermal imager with a 256x192 resolution. It sports a Type-C male interface, and measures just 9g in weight. The temperature measurement range is from -4F to 1112F. It can record videos at up to 25 Hz. InfiRay claims an operational power consumption of less than 400 mW. The product also includes a magnetic macro lens that allows thermal investigation of minute components such as those on a circuit board. An extension cable (Type-C female to Type-C male) is also provided for flexibility in image capture.\nTOPDON is a vendor of automotive equipment including ADAS packages, battery tools, EV chargers, and diagnostic tools (including thermal cameras). It is much larger than the InfiRay P2 Pro, but has the same IR resolution of 256x192. It weighs 30g, and measures 71mm x 42mm x 14mm. The temperature measurement range is from -4F to 1022F. Included in the package is a 50cm USB cable with a Type-C female port at one end, and a Type-C male with an attached Type-C female to Type-A male adapter.\nWhile both the P2 Pro and the TOPDON TC001 have their own Android applications, TOPDON also provides the Windows-based TCView application for image / video capture and analysis.\nThe core technical specifications of both the InfiRay P2 Pro and the TOPDON TC001 are very similar. The table above presents a comparative view of the P2 Pro and the TC001 against other cameras targeting similar market segments.\nApplication Interfaces and Sample Images\nThe InfiRay P2 Pro and the TOPDON TC001 identify themselves as USB cameras when connected to a PC. The vendor and device identifiers point to a Realtek bridge chip / microcontroller in the package. The units generate 256x384 streams, and the actual image data is 256x192 (which can be viewed through programs like guvcview on Ubuntu). The other 256x192 stream is the temperature data.\nOpen-source software based on a reverse-engineered version of the image structure is also available for viewing live feeds from these thermal cameras. We put that to test and found that it managed to provide insight into the data from the cameras without having to install any closed-source software.\nWe are currently working on extending the software to be able to read and put out actionable information from photos and videos recorded using the respective smartphone applications.\nThe galleries below present some screenshots of the InfiRay P2 Pro and the TOPDON TC001 Android apps\nSince the internal platforms for both thermal cameras are the same, it is no surprise that the different menu options all end up configuring the same aspects. In general, we found the TOPDON TC001 app to be more intuitive, while the P2 Pro had most options hidden away under sub-menus. Overall, both applications allowed clear visualization of temperature gradients.\nThe image and video quality, as well as temperature readings for the same scenes, were similar for both the P2 Pro and the TC001. Some sample images are presented in the above galleries. We also captured some videos and they kept up with the advertised frame rates, except for the periodic calibration durations.\nThe P2 Pro's macro lens does enable a differentiation - it is possible to take close-up pictures of PCBs under operation similar to the one above.\nConcluding Remarks\nThe InfiRay P2 Pro and the TOPDON TC001 use the same thermal imaging sensor, but target different market segments. The TOPDON TC001 is a bit more bulky, but comes with a more flexible extension cable and associated software interface. The availability of a Windows program to interface with the TC001 is a big plus for automotive repair shops, as most of them run other related software on that platform. The P2 Pro focuses on the general consumer market and electronic repair shops. Its compact and lightweight nature is an advantage in the former segment. The macro lens helps in determining locations of shorts or faulty components in small PCBs.\nBoth cameras use the same image sensor and USB bridge / microcontroller. The availability of publicly documented APIs for the TOPDON TC001 results in the same being applicable to the InfiRay P2 Pro also. Even without those APIs, the temperature storage format has been reverse-engineered, and a proof-of-concept open-source software interface is already available. There is no need to install closed-source software in order to access and analyze the recorded videos and photographs.\nWhile the image quality is excellent, and sensor size for the price is quite good, we are not entirely convinced by the accuracy of temperature measurements under automatic calibration. It is possible that tweaked emissivity settings may deliver better results, but we saw the FLIR ONE Pro under similar default conditions deliver much more accurate results. This is an aspect that needs further investigation. That said, most consumer thermal camera applications require the observation of temperature gradients rather than the absolute values. For such use-cases, thermal cameras such as the InfiRay P2 Pro and the TOPDON TC001 provide excellent value for money in the $200 - $300 price bracket.\nAnother aspect that deserves mention prior to wrap up is the availability of 25 Hz thermal camera videos at very affordable price points for the consumer market. US-based manufacturers such as FLIR and Seek Thermal may need to work on getting past the artificially-imposed 9 Hz limitation if they are to remain competitive against the offerings from IRay Technologies in the global market.\nPost Your Comment\n12 Comments\nView All Comments\nPIPELINE STORIES\nLINKS\nTOPICS\nFOLLOW\nLog in\nDon't have an account?
