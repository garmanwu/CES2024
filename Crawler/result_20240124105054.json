        "raw_content": "Jackery unveils two new green energy concept products at CES 2024\nAt CES 2024, Jackery showcased two new concept products, the Jackery Solar Generator Mars Bot and Rooftop Tents plus the Home Back Up system with transfer switch.\nThe Solar Generator Mars Bot, inspired by Opportunity, the exploration robotic rover that operated on the planet Mars, is a game changer in the renewable energy landscape. Having already won the Time Best Inventions of 2023 Award, the CES Innovation Award 2024, and the A'Design Award Winner Bronze, this groundbreaking product is a PV-ESS charging integrated intelligent service robot with a light tracking system that addresses various off-grid outdoor needs and offers a new perspective on the efficient use of renewable clean energy.\nThe Solar Generator Mars Bot is equipped with intelligent sensors for visual obstacle avoidance, autonomous motion planning, a light tracking system, and a power detection system, enabling it to navigate intelligently towards areas of strong light for photovoltaic power generation or charging stations in low light conditions.\nJackery also unveiled the Jackery Rooftop Tents with the solar generator, an innovative off-road motorhome, and overlanding home, ideal for outdoor explorations and travel. This zero-carbon overlanding home can provide up to 6kWh for one day of overlanding and two weeks of outdoor living, providing extra power for extended use of essential appliances.\nJackery Solar Generator for Rooftop Tent\nBoth pioneering inventions represent a novel approach to the efficient use of renewable clean energy \u2013 urgently needed while we live amid an energy crisis. \u00a0The robot offers a high-efficiency photoelectric conversion rate and ensures a seamless electricity experience with its superior intelligent motion system. It is a nod to the adventurous spirit, providing a reliable energy source for those who dare to venture into the unknown and explore the world, and embodies Jackery's spirit of exploration in its design and functionality.\nJackery Solar Generator Home Kit\nThe Jackery Solar Generator Home Kit, which includes a transfer switch, Solar Generator 2000 Plus 400W, and battery packs, was also on display during CES 2024. The intelligent management system allows Jackery's portable power stations to be easily converted into home storage units, bridging the gap between on-the-go power and stationary home energy needs. During power cuts or blackouts, the transfer switch automatically switches the battery power from the grid to solar energy.\nFor further information on all Jackery products, please visit uk.jackery.com"

It may only be a concept, but we could see units officially launch as early as the end of the year.\nJackery is debuting one of the more creative things I\u2019ve seen from the portable power station in ages \u2013 a rooftop tent that transforms into a solar generator. The perfect tool for converting your car or truck into more than just a vehicle, the rooftop solar tent takes camping trips and any off-grid excursion up a notch or two.\nThe tent featrues a pair of retractable solar panels whihc can produce 1,000W of combined power from the sun. Jackery does note that this is in ideal conditions like when the unit is facing south \u2013 and most importantly when your car is parked (please do not try and drive with something like this extended on your ride\u2019s roof, please). That equates to as much as 4.96kWh of energy per day.\nThis is very much still a concept, with some big questions about the new Jackery rooftop solar tent remaining unanswered. How will it hold up against wind when fully popped out? Who is the company partnering with to produce the tent aspect of the release, if any other brands at all?\nAs far as the showcase goes at CES 2024, the tent and its onboard solar panels will connect into one of the company\u2019s E1000 Plus power stations. That gives it 2,000W of AC energy to disperse through your campsite or remote work setup, and even offers more flexible power options thanks to optional expansion batteries. Jackery rounds out the concept with some other frills like a memory foam mattress, dimmable color lights, and a waterproof insulation with blackout windows.\nThe sad news about the new Jackery rooftop solar tent is that it won\u2019t be officially launching until far later in the year \u2013 maybe not even until 2025. The company is noting that the new release will go into production sometime in Q4 of this year, which gives a lot of wiggle room as to when it\u2019ll actually show up on store shelves. But CES is all about showcasing some lofty new releases, with more of a focus on getting enthusiasts excited versus having products ready to ship. So it\u2019s just par for the course!\nEven so, I am incredibly excited to be seeing Jackery do something far outside the box. We\u2019ve seen so many new releases in the portable power and solar space lately that give veterans like Jackery some major competition. So getting even a sneak peak at something as creative and hopefully useful as the new Jackery rooftop solar tent is just what I needed to re-convince me that the company still has it. I\u2019ll be patiently waiting for more information going forward, and will be sure to provide updates as Jackery is ready to share them.\nAdd 9to5Toys to your Google News feed.\nGoogle News\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!\nGuides\nJackery\nCES 2024\nAbout the Author\nRikka Altland\nRikka Altland's favorite gear\nNintendo Switch\nPhilips Hue Go\nPopular in the Community"

But we\u2019re now seeing a lot more movement into a related technology; home power storage from the same manufacturers such as Jackery, EcoFlow and Bluetti.\nOf course, being able to store power for emergency or EV charging isn\u2019t new. Even Tesla\u2019s Powerwall has been around in some form or another for 8 years now. But what is new is that these solutions are becoming more accessible. And that\u2019s certainly the case with Jackery\u2019s Solar Generator Home Kit announced at CES 2024.\nThe setup has a box that sits on the wall at home, but the battery power itself is stored on the type of power packs we\u2019ve got used to seeing in recent times, notably Jackery\u2019s Explorer 2000 Plus and an extra battery pack. So you can plug them in when at home or take them out with you if you need instead of having to have dedicated wall-mounted storage.\nThe power pack can be charged with solar thanks to fold-out, carryable panels, and the setup Jackery had at the show boasted two of these.\nThe wall box has an inverter plus a transfer switch plus a power management system. The setup offers a capacity of up to 10 kWh with 3000 watts of power and processes up to 1200 watts of solar input.\nWe think we\u2019ll be seeing a lot more of battery backup systems over the coming years as our power needs at home increase, particularly with the move to EVs.\nJackery also showed off some unusual concepts during CES, the Solar Generator Rooftop Tent boasts integrated extendable solar panels and power storage.\nThen, the rather fantastic-looking Solar Generator Mars Bot with Sun Tracker is a photovoltaic energy storage device on wheels offering an output of 600W and very efficient swiveling solar panels Thanks to 4G sensors, laser radar and cameras, it boasts visual obstacle avoidance and movement planning plus it can track light and so move itself \u2013 and the panels \u2013 to where the sun is at its strongest.\nDan is Editor-in-chief of Stuff, working across the magazine and the Stuff.tv website.\nOur Editor-in-Chief is a regular at tech shows such as CES in Las Vegas, IFA in Berlin and Mobile World Congress in Barcelona as well as at other launches and events.
