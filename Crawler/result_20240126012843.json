(Shanghai, China), a vendor of wireless IoT products, has sent a cease-and-desist letter to Renesas Electronics Corp. (Tokyo, Japan) demanding it stop saying that Quectel modules have been banned by the US government.\nQuectel claims that Renesas sent a PowerPoint presentation to Quectel\u2019s customers saying that and that the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has granted a request from the US House of Representatives to ban Quectel\u2019s IoT modules, and that the modules are now on a banned list.\nQuectel asserts that both these statements are untrue and defamatory. \u00a0It has called for Renesas to retract the statements and make a correction.\nQuectel makes cellular modules from 2G/3G up to 5G, GNSS satellite modules and modules for Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connection as well as providing antennas and services.\nOn September 6 Reuters reported that FCC Chairwoman Jessica Rosenworcel asked US government agencies to consider declaring that Chinese companies including Quectel and Fibocom Wireless pose national security risks. Previously the Republican chair of the House of Representatives China Select Committee, Mike Gallagher, and Democrat Raja Krishnamoorthi had asked the FCC to consider adding to the two companies to its so-called Covered List, the report said.\n\u201cIt has recently come to our attention that a number of competitors are propagating false and defamatory rumors and distributing material containing false and defamatory statements to Quectel\u2019s customers and potential customers,\u201d said Norbert Muhrer, chief sales officer at Quectel, in a statement. He added: \u201cWe will vigorously defend ourselves against false claims and we will not tolerate untrue and defamatory practices targeting Quectel and its customers. To be clear, Quectel\u2019s IoT modules are not, and never have been, on the FCC\u2019s Covered List or any other US government agency list that would subject Quectel or its products to restrictions of any kind.\u201d\nQuectel acknowledged that it has made submissions to the FCC trying to make the case that its modules do not pose a risk to national security or privacy. Quectel\u2019s most recent submission to the FCC on this subject is here.\nOne of the concerns discussed is that Quectel could, in some way, retain control over IoT modules and even if the company could not exfiltrate data, it could disable a module designed into critical infrastructure. Quectel claims that a letter sent to the FCC by the Select Committee to the US Congress contained several misconceptions about how Quectel modules work.\nQuectel said it has retained Finite State Inc. (Columbus, Ohio) an independent security firm, to conduct an audit and penetration testing of Quectel\u2019s modules and has received high marks for the security and transparency of its modules.\nThe statement concluded: \u201cQuectel looks forward to demonstrating its modules\u2019 security to government officials. It also is determined to prevent competitors like Renesas from spreading falsehoods about its products.\u201d\nRenesas sent its own statement to eeNews Europe saying: \u201cWe are aware of the matter and currently examining the accusation. We have no comment at this time.\u201d\nQuectel was founded in 2010 and is headquartered in Shanghai, China. The company has R&D offices at multiple sites in China and in Vancouver, Canada; Belgrade, Serbia; and Penang, Malaysia.\nwww.quectel.com\nwww.renesas.com\nwww.finitestate.io\nMorse Micro and Quectel to take Wi-Fi HaLow\u00a0to market\nQuectel, Amarisoft target increased adoption of NTN\nRenesas restructures to break out its power, software, manufacturing\nAll material on this site Copyright \u00a9 2022\nEuropean Business Press SA.
