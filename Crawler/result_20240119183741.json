These products are ideal for IoT-related devices, including wearable devices, healthcare equipment, and logistics terminals, which are required to be smaller and thinner.\nThe newly-developed EYSKBNZWB module can support the long-range capability, which has been newly added to the Bluetooth\u00ae 5 standard. This capability will improve the connectivity of wireless communication over a long distance or in an environment in which it is hard to receive radio waves, allowing you to extend the effective communication distance.\nThe EYSLSNZWW module utilizes our unique shield mold technology, realizing an almost 90% reduction in volume compared with our conventional module, EYSLCNZWW (9.6\u00d712.9\u00d72.0 mm).\nTAIYO YUDEN TECHNO SOLUTIONS CO., LTD. (Takasaki City, Gunma Prefecture, Japan) will commence mass production of these products in September 2018. A sample of each model will cost 3,000 yen*2.\nTechnology Background IoT-related devices are required to be operable in sensor networks everywhere and to have an extremely low power consumption. In addition, such devices will be used in a wide variety of applications, sizes, and environments, which in turn requires the embedded wireless modules to be available in a wide range of lineup. Most of those devices use Bluetooth\u00ae\u00a0as the low-power consumption wireless communication standard. Building on the low-power consumption of Bluetooth\u00ae V4.2, the latest version standard, Bluetooth\u00ae 5, is equipped with new capabilities for supporting various needs, such as a two-fold increase in communication speed or up to a four-fold increase in communication range.\nTAIYO YUDEN has successfully commercialized Bluetooth\u00ae 5 compatible wireless communication modules. Today, we announced the launch of the new communication modules, EYSKBNZWB and EYSLSNZWW.
