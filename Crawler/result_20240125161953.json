It's one of the first to utilize Matter over Thread for long battery up to 8 months.\nIt also touts fingerprint security, PIN codes, NFC, and multiple voice assistants including Apple Home. Unfortunately, no word on Home Key support.\nAqara's new smart plug is also unique, being one of the first to include Thread border router capabilities baked in. It bridges your Thread network to your Wi-Fi for a more seamless smart home experience.\nIt tracks energy consumption in real-time, logging historical data that syncs back to the Aqara app, providing visibility into power usage.\nPlus, it is able to act as a power detector. It can tell whether the connected device is on or off which can trigger additional scenes.\nFor example, maybe a user would want the shades in the living room to close when the TV is turned on. Or your goodnight scene could be set when a phone is placed on a charger.\nFinally, there is the new Aqara Hub M3 that builds on all the features offered in the Hub M2.\nIt retains the Hub M2 Zigbee and infrared capabilities but also adds Thread and Bluetooth protocols. This allows it to work as a Matter controller, Thread border router, and more.\nThere's also 5GHz dual-band Wi-Fi, Power over Ethernet (PoE) connection, and it can connect to devices outside the Aqara ecosystem.\nThe Hub M3 will ship in Q2 2024 with a price to be announced soon.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design.

        "raw_content": "Aqara\u2019s new hub is a multi-protocol Matter powerhouse\nAqara\u2019s new hub is a multi-protocol Matter powerhouse\nThe Aqara Hub M3 could turn Aqara into a real contender as a smart home platform. The company also announced a new smart lever lock, a Thread border router smart plug, and Home Copilot, a generative AI chatbot.\nBy\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy, a smart home reviewer who's been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a writer for Wirecutter, Wired, and BBC Science Focus.\nShare this story\nSmart home company Aqara is finally launching its long-promised Hub M3, and it looks like it will be worth the wait. First teased in 2022, the Hub M3 is a Zigbee 3.0 hub for Aqara\u2019s wide range of Zibgee devices, but it will also act as a Thread border router and a Matter controller for Aqara\u2019s ecosystem. This means you should be able to connect any Matter-compatible device to the M3, from Philips Hue lights and Eve smart shades to Google\u2019s Nest Thermostat, and control and automate them all from Aqara\u2019s powerful app.\nAqara is poised to become a complete smart home platform like Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, or Google Home\nThis move turns Aqara\u2019s app into a serious option for managing your entire smart home; previously, it was limited to just controlling Aqara\u2019s device. Now, it\u2019s poised to become a more complete smart home platform like Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, or Google Home, and the other features of the Hub M3 could put it significantly ahead of many of those ecosystems.\nHowever, Aqara does note that support for third-party Matter devices will be rolled out in waves, so not all device types will be supported when the M3 launches globally in Q2 2024.\nThe M3 features a built-in IR blaster for controlling devices like your TV remote or AC unit, which can also be exposed to Matter. It has dual-band Wi-Fi, Bluetooth connectivity for Matter onboarding, and two power options: USB-C or power over ethernet.\nAccording to Aqara, the M3 will also move data storage from the cloud to the edge, secured by end-to-end encryption, along with the ability to process automations locally. It can also continue to run those automations over your network even if the internet or cloud connection is down.\nRelated\nAqara is launching an automatic backup feature with the M3 where if you have two or more Hub M3, your automations can be automatically mirrored to the secondary hub, which can take over if the main hub fails.\nAnother neat feature Aqara will bring to the hub is support for binding between Aqara Thread devices. This lets two devices communicate directly without the need for the hub or an internet connection. A motion sensor could be bound to a smart switch or a temperature sensor to a thermostat, and if the hub were removed or fails, the device\u2019s automation (i.e., turn on the light when motion is detected) would continue to work.\nThe company has not announced pricing for the M3. Aqara\u2019s current Hub M2 costs $60, but with all of the extra functions, the new model is likely to be higher than that.\nAqara also unveiled two more products: a new smart lever lock and a smart plug that can act as a Thread border router, alongside a new feature in its app designed to make smart home automations easier to set up.\nAqara Border Router Smart Plug\nThis is the first smart plug to be announced that also works as a Thread border router, which you need if you add Thread devices to your smart home. The plug uses dual-band Wi-Fi to enable Thread devices to communicate with the internet. The plug can also monitor energy use and act as a Thread mesh extender, according to Aqara.\nAqara Smart Lock U300\nThe Smart Lock U300 is a fingerprint / keypad smart lock for doors with lever locks, such as garages, side entries, and home offices. The U300 works over Thread and is compatible with Matter. It can be used indoors or outdoors and has a battery life of up to eight months. It works with the Aqara app or any Matter app (Apple Home, Google Home, Amazon Alexa) and has a keypad, a fingerprint reader, and NFC tags as entry options.\nAqara Home Copilot\nAqara also announced a new generative AI assistant coming to its Aqara app. Home Copilot is a new chatbot interface for the Aqara Home app that can create automations for you via voice or text requests, which should make setting up automations a lot simpler. Aqara says Home Copilot can also analyze usage patterns and suggest custom automations, including tailored plans for setting up energy-saving automations.\nWhat is Matter?\nMatter is a new smart home interoperability standard designed to provide a common language for connected devices to communicate locally in your home without relying on a cloud connection. It is built to be secure and private, easy to set up, and widely compatible.\nDeveloped by Apple, Amazon, Google, and Samsung (and others), Matter is an open-sourced, IP-based connectivity software layer for smart home devices. It works over Wi-Fi, ethernet, and the low-power mesh networking protocol Thread and currently supports over 20 device types. These include lighting, plugs and switches, thermostats, locks, security and environment sensors, refrigerators, dishwashers, smoke alarms, air quality monitors, and more.\nA smart home gadget with the Matter logo can be set up and used with any Matter-compatible ecosystem via a Matter controller and controlled by them simultaneously, a feature called multi-admin.\nAmazon Alexa, Google Home, Samsung SmartThings, and Apple Home are some of the major smart home platforms that support Matter, along with hundreds of device manufacturers.\nNetflix is turning into cable TV\nNetflix is going to take away its cheapest ad-free plan\nNintendo goes after the Palworld Pok\u00e9mon modder\nThe Verge\u2019s favorite mobile phone gadgets\nTesla\u2019s new compact crossover is reportedly coming in 2025, but will it cost $25,000?\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nEcovacs\u2019 new cleaning station pairs its flagship robovac with a handheld vacuum\nThis smart lock can recognize your face\nVictrola\u2019s new Stream Sapphire turntable can stream to anything\nThis Philips door lock turns your palm into a key\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

The Hub M3 will be showcased at the Aqara booth (Venetian Expo #53513) alongside other latest smart home solutions and prototypes at the 2024 CES in Las Vegas.\nBuilding upon the success of the Aqara Hub M2, the M3 retains essential features like Zigbee hub functionality and an infrared (IR) blaster, and takes a significant leap forward by incorporating Thread and Bluetooth protocols.\u00a0This enhancement makes the M3 a versatile Matter controller and Thread Border Router, positioning it as the ideal control center for a seamless, local, and future-proof smart home. The M3 also boasts 2.4GHz/5GHz dual-band Wi-Fi and Power over Ethernet (PoE) connection for extra flexibility and stability.\nThe Hub M3 is the cornerstone in the Matter-enabled Aqara ecosystem. Beyond the expansive range of Aqara accessories and infrared-compatible gadgets, users can now integrate third-party Matter devices into the Aqara Home automation engine, enabling a unified and comprehensive smart home experience with this single product. The M3 will also expose the connected IR devices to Matter, allowing users to control and automate their infrared ACs and TVs via Aqara Home or any Matter ecosystems of their choice.\nDesigned for decentralized and robust operation, the M3 offers edge capabilities for local control and automation. Its substantial eMMC storage enables local, end-to-end encrypted data storage, and locally processed automation, which reduces system latency and minimizes\u00a0reliance on cloud services. The M3 can also connect to the Aqara Home app via a local network (LAN), ensuring continuous control of the Aqara system during cloud service or internet outage. The M3 also features dynamic leadership and automatic backup. When an extra M3 hub is deployed to the network, automations can be automatically mirrored, preparing the new hub to take over the network if the leading M3 fails. Ultimately, the M3 hub will support binding between Aqara Thread devices, allowing some automations to remain functional even without a hub. These features provide users with seamless connectivity as well as enhanced security and privacy.\nAdditional highlights of the Aqara M3 Hub include:\n\u2022\u00a0Two-way, 360\u00b0\u00a0IR blaster: The M3 transmits commands and recognizes when a conventional IR remote is utilized, allowing for better status detection. Furthermore, it can function as an AC thermostat when connected to a temperature sensor from Aqara.\n\u2022\u00a0Enhanced functionalities for Aqara devices: The M3 serves as a Matter bridge for classic Aqara Zigbee devices**, and gives additional functionalities to Aqara Thread devices, such as adjustable sensitivity and tamper alarm for the Aqara Door and Window Sensor P2.\n\u2022\u00a0Powerful speaker and custom ringtones: The M3 features a powerful 95dB speaker that can be used as a siren of the Aqara Home Alert System or for the custom voice announcements.\n\u2022\u00a0Privacy focus: The M3 preserves users\u2019 privacy as it is not equipped with a camera or microphone. It also supports local, end-to-end encrypted storage of device logs and user data, ensuring that home events remain private.\n\u2022\u00a0Flexible installation: The M3 includes a mount, screws and a sticker for flexible installation options, from horizontal placement to wall and ceiling mounting. MagicPair is also supported for easy binding to Aqara Home.\nThe Aqara Hub M3 is expected to ship globally in Q2 2024.\n* The support of third-party Matter devices is rolled out in waves, and some device types may not be supported by the time of M3 launch.\n** Due to the lack of Matter specs for certain device types, some Aqara Zigbee devices cannot be exposed to Matter. When the Aqara Zigbee device migrated from the Zigbee hub (e.g. Hub M2, M1S/M1S Gen 2, E1) to the M3, it needs to be reconfigured in Matter and HomeKit.\nAbout Aqara\nFounded in 2016, Aqara is a leading smart home provider with offices in New York and Shenzhen. With a comprehensive portfolio ranging from a variety of smart sensors to switches, cameras, curtain controllers, and smart door locks, the Company is committed to enabling smart homes experience that is seamless, proactive and intuitive.

        "raw_content": "Aqara announce new devices at CES 2024\nAqara is introducing an array of new devices, including a Thread border router-enabled smart plug and the Thread-capable Smart Lock U300. Among the highly anticipated releases are the Aqara M3 hub and Copilot, a new AI app by Aqara.\nAqara M3 Hub\nThe Aqara Hub M3, building on its predecessor, the Aqara Hub M2, retains pivotal features such as Zigbee hub capabilities and an infrared (IR) blaster while adding Thread and Matter. This evolutionary leap positions the M3 as a versatile Matter controller and Thread Border Router, making it the central hub for a seamless, local, and future-proof smart home experience. With additional features like dual-band Wi-Fi and Power over Ethernet (PoE), the M3 offers enhanced flexibility and stability.\nServing as the cornerstone in the Matter-enabled Aqara ecosystem, the Hub M3 goes beyond supporting Aqara accessories and infrared-compatible devices. It now enables the integration of third-party Matter devices into Aqara Home and should expose compatible devices to Apple Home, providing users with a unified and comprehensive smart home experience through a single product. Moreover, the M3 exposes connected IR devices to Matter, empowering users to manage and automate their infrared ACs and TVs using Aqara Home or any preferred Matter ecosystems.\nThe Aqara Hub M3 is slated for global release in Q2 2024.\nAqara Thread Border Router Smart Plug\nThe Aqara Border Router Plug introduces a groundbreaking leap in smart plug technology, marking one of the initial smart plugs to integrate Thread Border Router capabilities. Boasting Thread and dual-band Wi-Fi, this plug empowers Matter controllers lacking Thread compatibility to oversee Thread devices, facilitating a smooth assimilation of these devices into smart home systems sans the requirement for a new Matter controller.\nOperating in a particularly energy-efficient mode when utilizing Thread alone, it significantly curtails idle consumption while extending the mesh Thread network by managing data packets. Its energy-conscious design furnishes users with real-time and historical data on household energy usage, enabling the automation of electrical devices for reduced energy wastage.\nMoreover, the Border Router Plug boasts the capability to detect the on/off status of the connected appliance, thereby triggering Aqara Home automations accordingly. For instance, users can effortlessly automate the closure of curtains upon the activation of the TV.\nThe new Aqara Thread Border Router smart plug is expected to ship the second half of 2024.\nAqara U300 Thread smart lock\nThe Aqara Smart Lock U300 stands because of it is introduced with Matter and Thread compatibility. Its standout feature is its unparalleled adaptability across various smart home platforms, including Apple Home. With an impressive battery life lasting up to 8 months and improved local control, it prioritizes responsiveness, privacy, and security.\nCrafted for both indoor and outdoor use, the U300 replaces conventional US levers or knobs on single-bore doors. It\u2019s an excellent fit for side entries, garage access, home offices, basements, and storage spaces. This smart lock promotes a key-free lifestyle, offering multiple access modes like fingerprints, PIN codes, NFC, and integration with voice assistants, like Siri on the iPhone. Homeowners gain remote control, the ability to grant temporary access to guests, and real-time notifications about entries and exits\u2014all managed conveniently through a smartphone.\nBecause the U300 supports Matter, users will be be able to add the smart lock to Apple Home. This means users will be able to control the smart lock from the Home App, automations and Siri. However its unlikely that the U300 will support Apple HomeKey at this time.\nThe new Aqara U300 Thread smart lock is expected to ship the second half of 2024.\nNew Aqara AI update for its Home App\nDuring CES 2024, Aqara is set to unveil Home Copilot, the latest chatbot interface integrated into the Aqara Home app, leveraging Gen-AI technology. Home Copilot\u2019s primary aim is to elevate user experiences by harnessing ambient intelligence, translating real-time data into actionable insights.
