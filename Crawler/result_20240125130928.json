        "raw_content": "COATEMA\nWe offer the unique lab2fab concept\nOver 40 years of success in mechanical engineering for coating, printing and laminating machinery.\nThe company\u2019s lab2fab vision provides the basis for continuous expansion into new markets and products \u2013 and it's the main focus of all our activities for our customers.\nBased on lab2fab, we are able to offer customers appropriate concepts for laboratory, pilot and production machinery to cover the entire product development and product life cycle.\nThe COATEMA website\nSectors in focus\nInnovative research combined with specialized mechanical engineering\nThe benefit COATEMA offers its customers lies in the combination of innovative research, an integrated R&D centre and specialized mechanical engineering. The close interlocking of these three elements enables rapid processing and familiarization with new technologies and markets. In today\u2019s technology markets such as renewable energies, printed electronics and sustainable packaging, COATEMA customers need integrated, innovative solutions.\nResearch into alternatives to silicon-based solar cells has been going on for more than 15 years, mainly focused on printed CIGS, dye-sensitized solar cells (DSSC) and polymer solar cells. COATEMA specializes in the roll-to-roll production of these solar cells. The company is also involved in the development of new cell types, such as perovskite solar cells.\nPrinted, flexible and organic electronics is one of the key technologies of the future: from printed circuits to flexible displays, COATEMA is one of the innovators and technology developers in this growth market. It is has pilot machines at all European development centres and is a leader in Asia with production solutions in the area of flexible displays.\nCoatings for the medical and pharmaceutical sector are subject to rigorous requirements due to standards such as GMP. In the pharmaceutical sector, the functionalization of surfaces using active ingredients is an important criterion. Here, COATEMA is involved in the development of laboratory, pilot and production facilities for such products as transdermal wound dressings and oral film strips.\nMembranes and conditioned membrane surfaces are used for a variety of applications. Water filtration or the reverse osmosis process for the extraction of drinking water from salt water can be produced on COATEMA production machines. Yet another example of the successful scaling of lab2fab solutions at COATEMA are the areas of nanofiltration and proton-conducting membranes for fuel cell applications.\nCOATEMA offers solutions for the coating and impregnation of composites with thermoset systems, focusing its development on thermoplastic applications. In addition, it offers highly innovative machine concepts for the impregnation and coating of rovings, tapes and fabrics made of carbon fibres, basalt and glass fibres to meet the growing demand for prepegs.\nSince its foundation over 40 years ago, COATEMA has been the brand name for coating and laminating machinery for the textile industry. Much of the development work done at the COATEMA R&D centre today is dedicated to plant solutions for technical textiles with stringent requirements for special burdens for smart new textiles.\nModern battery technologies such as lithium-ion, lithium-polymer, solid state, redox flow and nickel-metal hydride require particularly efficient coating and casting processes for the anode, cathode and separators \u2013 whether single or double-sided coating, applied horizontally or vertically. COATEMA uses such materials as nickel foam, thin copper substrates, aluminium films and expanded metals.\nCOATEMA has 20 years of experience and a diverse background in fuel cell technology, including close cooperation with research institutes worldwide and participation in fuel clusters such as the FCI in Aachen. As a result it has acquired expertise ranging from development to series production in the field of AFC, PEMFC, HTPEM, SOFC and MOFC fuel cells.\nThe COATEMA machines\nLaboratory machinery\nCreation of product samples in A4 or roll-to-roll\nCOATEMA\u2019s unique lab2fab concept starts with its laboratory machine platforms. Laboratory machines are designed for use in research and development and geared towards the development of processes and products.\nProduction machinery\nProduction machinery based on the lab2fab process\nYou can look forward to optimum production machines tailored precisely to your needs \u2013 based on more than 40 coating systems, optimized drying options as appropriate and process technology that meets your requirements. Production machinery is used when the required production volume calls for series production.\nPilot machinery\nPilot machines pave the way for production lines\nIt is only possible to master complex production processes by drawing on the knowledge gained from a pilot machine. Pilot machinery is used for the initial production of small batches and the further development of processes. Here, it is also possible to adjust most parameters during the process so as to achieve the desired series production.\nCustom-made machines and single units\nScale-up processes for emerging markets and high-tech industries\nIn new technologies, too, standards bring about continuous improvement, resulting in a high level of project efficiency. The focus of our activity is the area of custom-made machine construction\u00a0and especially scale-up processes for R2R processes in high-tech industries such as fuel cells, batteries, solar and many other high-tech applications.\nSch\u00fctzenstra\u00dfe 105 22761 Hamburg\n+49 40 853 93 02info@ath-group.de"

For laboratory and pilot plants, Coatema has developed a platform strategy that aims to develop lab2fab systems based on high technical standards that can then be adjusted to precise needs through customer-specific modifications. The advantage of this when compared with one-off special machinery is that tried-and-tested standard components are used that are then still available as spare parts decades later and that further developments of technologies can be offered directly to existing customers.\nThis means that each machine is a special customer-specific solution but is based on existing technology platforms such as the Test Solution, Smartcoater or Click&CoatTM platform. Each machine is a special design that arises from agreements and joint development with the customer.\nFrom individual units to complete turnkey plants, we offer systems for continuous or intermittent operation for all formats from DIN A4 to working widths of 3,000 mm.\nWith our sister companies KROENERT and DRYTECH in the ATH Group, we are able to offer the fab2lab approach at all times. If you have established production technologies for standard markets and are looking for new markets for your company we can reproduce this strategic approach through our two R&D centres in Hamburg and Dormagen.\nLaboratory machinery\nDesigned mainly for use in research and development, laboratory machines can be tools for perfecting products, processes, and procedures.\nTheir compact design allows them to be easily integrated into existing facilities.
