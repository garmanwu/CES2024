        "raw_content": "PEZA sets aggressive investment approach for 2024\nThe Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) is welcoming the new year with vigor as it prepares to pursue more investment opportunities and facilitating investor growth through multiplying its ecozones in the country.\nIn a statement released on Tuesday, Jan. 2, PEZA Director General Tereso Panga shared the agency's \"strategic focus\" for 2024 revolving on \"an aggressive approach to acquiring investments, cultivating a sound business environment that supports investor growth, championing ease of doing business, and fostering vertical supply and global value chains that align with Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and global partners.\"\nPanga emphasized that the country is \"poised for continued success in 2024\" despite expected economic headwinds.\nFor 2023, the agency logged P175 billion investment approvals, which was 10 percent higher than their initial approvals target, and significantly beyond the P140 billion recorded in 2022.\nPEZA is now aiming to reach P250 billion investment approvals by the end of this year, hopefully achieving the pre-pandemic investment levels.\nIn addition, it is also aiming to generate 80,000 to 100,000 new jobs given its upcoming ecozone projects this year.\nThe agency shared its optimism that it will accomplish its targets given the country's projected gross domestic product or GDP growth trajectory, backed by the booming information technology and business process management (IT-BPM) industry in the Philippines.\n\"I am confident that as we set a higher level of ecozone management and provide new avenues of growth for current and prospective investors with various types of ecozones, even a mega ecozone, we will see more businesses landing on our shores,\" said Panga.\nAmong its target sectors include advanced manufacturing, electric vehicle (EV) production, frontier technologies, regenerative agriculture and blue resources, green ores processing, renewable and alternative energy, and eco-industrial park and smart township development.\nIt added that new trade and investment areas will be further explored with partners such as Canada, South Korea, Australia, the Middle East, the European Union, and China.\n\"As we spread ecozones across the Philippines as envisioned by the President, it is the goal of PEZA to accelerate countrywide economic development to benefit our countrymen. More ecozones mean more businesses and more employment and improved quality of life for Filipinos across the Philippines. Our reinvigorated mission and mantra will be eco-zoning the Philippines towards inclusive and sustainable development,\" remarked Panga."

Marcos Jr., contributed to the heightened interests of foreign companies in exploring business opportunities in the Philippines.\nPEZA got investment pledges worth PHP1.4 billion during its outbound mission in the United States from Jan. 4 to 14, PHP10.8 billion from an outbound mission in Japan with Junca Holdings, PHP8.32 billion in China on Sept. 14 to 21, PHP20.6 billion from the Taiwan mission on Oct. 23 to 27, and PHP1.8 billion from United Arab Emirates from the Nov. 6 to 10 outbound mission.\nThe IPA also accompanied President Marcos during his visit to Tokyo, Japan on Feb. 8 to 12, when the delegation bagged investment pledges amounting to PHP720.91 billion.\nMeanwhile, PEZA\u2019s highest investment approvals was in 2012 with project registrations amounting to PHP312 billion, followed by PHP295 billion in 2015 and PHP279 billion in 2014.\nDe Lima headed PEZA from 1995 to 2016, spanning four administrations.

Marcos when it was first introduced as a policy tool for development and export-oriented growth particularly for developing economies,\u201d said Panga.\n\u201cHowever, over the last five decades, the ecozones have proliferated in the region and have become increasingly common among Asean economies as a platform for attracting foreign direct investments (FDI) and growing exports,\u201d he added.\nWith the Asean remaining a top recipient of FDIs in developing regions and continuing to be an engine of growth, Panga said the Philippines can capitalize on the economic zone program to improve its current fourth place ranking in terms of FDI inflows.\n\u201cGiven the right ecosystem and enabling laws, the Philippine economy could be boosted if economic activities flourish in the ecozones and their linkage in the domestic market,\u201d said Panga.\nPeza has established 421 ecozones since its inception in 1995, now housing 4,346 locator firms or projects, most of which are export-oriented.\nSubscribe to our daily newsletter\nBy providing an email address.

The agency was able to recover in 2022 with a 103 percent increase in investments.\n\"If we will target another increase, 15 percent, over our baseline for 2023, we're looking at P202 billion in investments by 2024, but this is still conservative. We really want to target over P250 billion because this will bring us back to the peak levels of PEZA when we were hitting P250 billion to P300 billion. We're out here to prove that we can regain the status,\" said Panga.\nAlong with an increase in investments was a 21 percent rise in the agency's number of projects to 233 from 194. The 233 projects this year include 214 locator projects and 19 developer projects.\nWhile investment numbers are optimistic, there was a slight decline logged in exports and employment as of October this year.\nDirect exports dipped 1.75 percent to $53.29 billion this year from $54.24 billion last year, while direct employment also inched down by 1.78 percent to 1.82 million jobs from 1.85 million jobs in 2022.\nStill, Panga said they are \"hoping to surpass our 2022 targets.\"\n\"Our positive forecast which we hope to achieve in 2024 is if we're able to hit 80,000 to 100,000 new jobs because, in that way, we can already contribute 10 percent out of the total target of IT & Business Process Association of the Philippines (IBPAP) alone of one million jobs by 2030,\" he added.\nOn a year-on-year comparative basis, PEZA's projected exports rose 101.7 percent to $4 billion in 2023 from $1.98 billion last year.\nMoreover, projected employment this year rose 20 percent to 40,527 jobs from 33,951 in 2022.\nThroughout 2023, PEZA's projects include 116 in ecozone export, 42 in ecozone information technology (IT), 18 in ecozone logistics, 30 in ecozone facilities, two in ecozone utilities, 19 in ecozone development, and six in the domestic market."

Peza is set to meet with locator companies to discuss the potential impact and benefits of CREATE on their operations.\nPeza Director General Charito Plaza told BusinessMirror she wants the investment promotion agency (IPA) to still have \u201cthe same globally competitive tax incentives and enhance with tax and non-tax subsidy for strategic big-ticket industries.\u201d\nAmong the incentives of a Peza-registered enterprise are income tax holiday (ITH), tax- and duty-free raw materials importation, capital equipment, machineries and exemption in other related fees.\nPlaza said Peza wants to give focus as well on the development of public and special economic zones in the private sector located in the countryside. This will allow the transformation of idle lands, which can attract different types of industry, she explained.\nPeza regulates around 410 economic zones nationwide as of November 2020, majority or 290 of which are IT parks and centers.\nWhile the regulator welcomed CREATE\u2019s signing, a Peza official raised concern over a vetoed item which resulted in removal of tax incentive extension availment for foreign direct investors.\nCREATE leaves registered business enterprises (RBEs) no choice but to accept the 10-year sunset period after the lapse of ITH, which follows the adoption of 25-percent corporate income tax (CIT) rate. Only new activities and projects will be granted fresh incentives, Peza noted.\nDeputy Director General for Policy and Planning Tereso Panga, in a recent statement, said this can have repercussions for existing locators.\n\u201cThis scenario could be a make or break for the Philippines as the affected ecozone locators, for example, might decide to retain their facilities and invest in new projects to be entitled to a longer ITH and SCIT (special corporate income tax) period (total of 14-17 years),\u201d Panga said.\n\u201c[Or] worse, they might just pack up and transfer to a more willing host-country that can offer better incentives for their investments as their availment of more advantageous incentives for sunk projects with the IPAs prior to CREATE were cut short by the mandatory sunset period for RBEs,\u201d he added.\nStill, Plaza is \u201chopeful\u201d the locator companies can adjust to the new measures under CREATE.\n\u201cWe believe that effective governance will be pivotal in our resolve to retain, expand and attract investments into the ecozones under the CREATE regime and in due time, our existing locators will be able to adjust to CREATE and continue to secure their investments in the Philippines,\u201d Plaza added.\nPresident Duterte signed CREATE into law last month after the measure underwent different versions through the years.\nThe law cut CIT rate to 20 percent from 30 percent for domestic corporations with net taxable income of P5 million and below, and have total assets of P100 million and below effective July 1, 2020. All other local firms and resident foreign companies pay 25-percent income tax.\nImage credits: PIA CAR\nKnow more\nPBBM backs moves to update economic provisions of the Constitution but says no to foreign ownership of land\nPBMM says he is not endorsing Taiwan independence, wants peaceful reunification\nPBBM wants Philhealth to show cost-benefit of premium hike\nTwo Filipinos nabbed in Japan for murder of Japanese couple\nShearline toll to Davao Region: 16 dead and 606,483 affected\nPBBM calls for national unity at 125th anniversary rites of first PHL Republic at Barasoain Church\nNEDA pushes water, fiscal, digital bills\nSeniors, PWDs to enjoy toll discounts soon, vows SMC\nPeza inks deal with RCBC, SMBC to broaden network\nMicroinsurance premiums grow to P10 billion-IC\nSenate, House gird for war over \u2018P.I.\u2019 as Cha-cha route\nMarcos touts 2024 medical milestone: 1st\u00a0lung transplant\nPHL envoy meets 18 Pinoy seafarers held in iran\nPBBM reorganizes NICA amid \u2018emerging threats\u2019\nSC junks petition to indict 21 policemen for murder in connection with 2016 drug operation in Caloocan\nHouse leader disowns unethical tactics in PI signature campaign\nTransport group decries LTO-NCR\u2019s collection of PUV listing renewals\nConcerns raised on DOJ opinion saying BPO workers in ecozones must work onsite\nUN Special Rapporteur Irene Khan arrives in Manila to assess freedom of expression\nDavao landslide death toll climbs to 16 \u2013 OCD\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Transportation sad para mahinay ug sulbad ang trafik (Programs that involve agriculture, farming, or food are the projects that the government should focus on so that the prices of products can be controlled and the economy will grow.

Kinahanglan ug maayo nga project management nya nai unity sa local ug national government para mapadali ang mga projects ug implement (The government should create a law to speed up the projects. We need good project management in coordination with the local and national governments to expedite the implementation of these projects),\" she added.\nThe Department of Budget and Management classified the key priority expenditures for the fiscal year (FY) 2024 National Budget into six areas.\nThese areas, according to DBM, will support the administration\u2019s targets and help the country attain a future-proof and sustainable economy.\nThe said expenditures are: Regional Development having a total budget allocation of P3.63 trillion, Shovel-ready Infrastructure projects with P214.3 billion, Investment in human capital development with\nP924.7 billion, Sustainable agriculture and food security with P197.84 billion, Climate change adaptation and mitigation with P543.45 billion, and Digital Transformation with P28.75 billion.\nThe P5.768 trillion 2024 National Budget constitutes 21.7% of the country\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP).\nIt is 9.5% higher compared to the FY 2023 National Budget.\n\"We want our economy to grow consistently from now, in the medium term, until 2028, and by doing that, we want our public expenditures or our government spending to contribute to that growth,\" said DBM Sec. Amenah Pangandaman during the briefing.\n\"We are encouraging all government agencies to spend their money because it does not mean that you're just providing services to the people but also you are contributing to our economy,\" Pangandaman added.\nMeanwhile, the NEDA also expressed their support for the proposed 2024 National Budget by providing higher allocations to regional development and infrastructure projects.\n\"The key to sustaining economic growth is to sustain the high growth of investments in the country. that is why we prioritize economic development in our regions, and we also don\u2019t want to spend a lot of things; we want to focus our spending on critical infrastructure projects,\" said NEDA Usec. Joseph Capuno in the same briefing.\nAs appropriate government spending and effective utilization of resources serve as contributing factors in economic growth, the EDG pointed out the government's underspending as state expenditures contracted this year.\nIn the first half of 2023, the government came up short on its spending program by 6.6%, with actual expenditures only amounting to P2.411 trillion.\nAs of the end of July 2023, the DBM had already released P4.89 trillion, or 93% of the 2023 National Budget.\nWith this, the budget department urged the national government agencies, local government units, and other government entities to formulate their own catch-up plans in order to accelerate the implementation of their projects and programs and expedite the delivery of public services.\nWith the upcoming 2024 National Budget, the economic team vowed to implement efficient budget utilization and execute fiscal stimulus activities, especially on priority expenditures that are expected to have great\u00a0impact on economic growth and sustainability.\nAccording to NEDA and DOF, the country saw an average of 5.3% in real GDP growth rate during the first six months of 2023.\nThis is a 6.4% rise in economic growth in the first quarter of the year and a 4.3% increase in the second quarter.\nThis figure, according to the economic team, suggests that the country is in the middle of a continued economic recovery and expansion, which resulted from the aggressive implementation of different programs and activities and the imposition of economic policies.\nThe economic team is optimistic in terms of the economic outlook for the years to come, as they laid down their growth assumptions of a 6% to 7% GDP growth rate for the rest of 2023 and a 6.5% to 8% economic growth from 2024 until the end of the Marcos administration in 2028.\n\"Our goal is to have a GDP growth rate of 6.6% in the second half of 2023, despite the challenges, we believe this is a very attainable target,\" Capuno said.

Castillo\nIn the first half of 2022, the Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) and Fiscal Incentives Review Board (FIRB) introduced notable changes regarding the implementation of Republic Act (RA) No. 11534 or the CREATE Law.\nIn an advisory dated April 28, the FIRB announced the availability of updated Annual Tax Incentives Report (ATIR) and Annual Benefits Report (ABR), among others, for submission by Registered Business Enterprises (RBEs) to PEZA.\nA month later, an FIRB advisory dated June 1 addressed the frequently asked questions regarding the Fiscal Incentives Registration and Monitoring Systems (FIRMS), ATIR, and ABR. Several issuances were circularized thereafter on the deadlines and extensions for submission of the updated PEZA reports for 2021.\nWith the frequent release of advisories, RBEs may be wondering \u2014 how can RBEs track the PEZA-mandated requirements? What reports are needed, and when are these due?\nFor easy reference, below is the list of reporting requirements and deadlines set by the PEZA Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR):\nThe non-filing and late submission of the above requirements are subject to the following penalties under Section 8 Rule XXV of the PEZA IRR:\nATIR and ABR requirements under RA No. 10708 or Tax Incentives Management and Transparency Act (TIMTA)\nUnder the CREATE Law\u2019s IRR, RBEs availing of tax incentives must submit to PEZA the updated ATIR and ABR templates, superseding the old TIMTA forms, within the following deadlines:\nThe MS Excel soft copies of these reports should be e-mailed to timta@peza.gov.ph and furnished to firbmeg@ntrc.gov.ph.\nThe penalty for non-submission of these reports, based on Section 7 of the TIMTA law, is as follows:\nWORK-FROM-HOME (WFH) COMPLIANCE REPORT\nUnder PEZA Memorandum Circular (MC) No. 2022-018, all Information Technology \u2013 Business Process Management (IT\u2013BPM) enterprises must submit a monthly WFH compliance report every fifth day of the following month to the online Information Technology Sector \u2013 Report Compliance System (ITS\u2013RCS).\nAs per FIRB Resolution No. 017-2022, 70% of the total work force is required to render\u00a0work within the ecozone, while employees working remotely under the WFH arrangement may not exceed 30% of the work force during the period April 1-Sept. 12. RBEs that fail to comply with the prescribed WFH threshold will have their fiscal and non-fiscal incentives suspended corresponding to the months of noncompliance, pursuant to Revenue Memorandum Circular (RMC) No. 23-2022.\nCERTIFICATE OF ENTITLEMENT TO TAX INCENTIVES (CETI)\nTo avail of the Income Tax Holiday and/or preferential rate granted by the CREATE Law, RMC No. 28-2022 requires all RBEs to secure the CETI before filing the Annual ITR. The CETI forms part of the other attachments to the Annual ITR for submission to the BIR starting with the taxable year 2022, as per FIRB Advisory 004-2022.\nCETI applications should be filed within 90 days prior to the Annual ITR filing deadline, and will be processed through the online registration and incentives application portal (FIRMS) where RBEs can submit and monitor applications for incentives granted by any Investment Promotion Agency.\nVALUE-ADDED TAX (VAT) ZERO-RATING CERTIFICATE\nUnder MC No. 2022-046, there is no need for RBEs to request a certified true copy of the PEZA-issued VAT zero-rating certificate. Each certificate contains an electronically generated QR code, which, when scanned, shows the Certificate Number, Company Name, and Date of Issuance \u2014 features for authentication purposes.\nEven before the CREATE Law took effect, PEZA was already endorsing to the BIR a monthly list of RBEs, which were issued VAT zero-rated certificates.\nWHAT\u2019S NEXT FOR RBES?\nIt is worth mentioning that payment of fines for noncompliance with the reporting requirements does not exclude the imposition of other administrative penalties such as suspension of incentives and permits and/or cancellation/revocation of registration, among others.\nThus, keeping abreast of the latest issuances and advisories is key to ensuring that RBEs can comply with mandated requirements. However, it might also help if the government could also look at the journey of RBEs using the same lens as investors. With the many compliance requirements, one might wonder \u2014 is the journey aligned with the government\u2019s objective of making doing business easier, or have we already gone down a bumpy road?\nThe views or opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the author and do not necessarily represent those of Isla Lipana & Co.

Part of the ecozones\u2019 core is also community-building.\u201d\nList of pending economic zones\nAs of October 2022, Panga said, \u201cPEZA currently has 13 pending economic zones that we look forward to be proclaimed by the current administration. One (1) is already endorsed to the Office of President Marcos, while 12 are endorsed to the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI).\u201d\nPanga said these 13 pending ecozones are expected to bring in investments amounting to PHP17.92 billion.\nFor the breakdown, there are seven pending manufacturing ecozones, two for IT Parks Centers, one for the Knowledge, Innovation, Science, and Technology (KIST) Park, and one agro-industrial ecozone which are all located outside Metro Manila.\nPanga is confident that in 2022, \u201cthere will be an upturn as we have been getting big-ticket projects enough to recover and even surpass our 2019 (investment) levels.\u201d\nPHILEA President Zaldarriaga said that from 1995 to March 2022, \u201cTotal investments from PHILEA ecozones is approximately PHP1.13 trillion, generated USD$ 411 billion in exports, and employed 378,395 workers.\u201d\nMore incoming projects\nPanga said the Light Industry & Science Park (LISP) last month closed a project with a data center with PHP3.4 billion of investments.\n\u201cAnother big-ticket investment is currently in talks with Suntrust,\u201d he said.\nMeanwhile, at the recent investment forum in Taiwan and South Korea, Panga said \u201cPEZA big-ticket projects from Taiwan and South Korea are ready to apply and register with us.\u201d\nWith aggressive investment promotions, he is confident that \u201cThe 6 to 7% target for 2022 is attainable and we must also continuously work with other agencies to promote the creation of more ecozones, particularly in the countryside and new growth areas.\u201d\nZaldarriaga said \u201cPHILEA and PEZA are partners in nation-building.\u201d (PR)\nRelated Articles\nPEZA partners with banks to lure more Japanese investors\nJanuary 23, 2024 6:18 pm\nITBPM jobs seen to breach 2-M mark in 2025\nJanuary 22, 2024 6:56 pm\nShutdown of Red Sea route to hike shipping fees by 15%\nJanuary 19, 2024 10:01 am\nPEZA vows more fervor in acquiring investments\nJanuary 2, 2024 4:10 pm\nComments\nGovernment Links\nCopyright 2024 Philippine News Agency.
