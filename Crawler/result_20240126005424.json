This time around, Scosche basically focused on Qi2-certified chargers and charging phone mounts. As a reminder, the wireless power consortium announced Qi2 a year ago, and we\u2019re seeing the first Qi2 devices out there now.\nScosche intros new accessories at CES 2024, led by the BaseLynx 2.0 Qi2 charging station\nLet\u2019s kick things off with the most notable product in the lineup, the BaseLynx 2.0. This is a modular charging system with Qi2 wireless charging. As you can see in the image provided above, this charging system has plenty of room for your devices.\nThis charging system features a Qi2-certified magnetic wireless charging stand, which can simultaneously charge Qi2-enabled phones, along with AirPods, and an Apple Watch. There are four interchangeable, connectable modules here. You\u2019ll be getting 60W of shared power between three USB-C ports. Scosche noted that this product is now available at Apple.com and select Apple stores.\nThe MagicMount Elite Charge 3-in-1 stand has also been announced\nIf you\u2019re in need of a car mount, Scosche has you covered. The MagicMount Elite Charge 3-in-1 product is here, and it\u2019s shown above. Why is it referred to as \u20183-in-1\u2019? Well, because it offers three in-vehicle mount options: Dash, Locking Vent, and Back of Screen/Tablet. The mount head pivots and slider on an aluminum rail. A cable management system is also built in here.\nThe company also presented a line-up of MagSafe-compatible MagicMount wireless charging phone mounts. These are made for MagSafe iPhones, but with the included MagicRing Adapter, you can also charge Android devices.\nIf you need a wall charger, Scosche has you covered\nSpeaking of charging, the company\u2019s PowerVolt wall chargers are also here. These are GaN chargers, so they\u2019re not only up to speed in the technology sense, but they\u2019re also smaller than they\u2019d be otherwise. Various options are available, from a single-port 30W charger to a 150W four port charger. All of them are made with 75% Certified Post Consumer Recycled Plastics.\nThe company also introduced some new cables\nScosche also announced the Scosche PowerVolt 40W dual USB-C port car adapter. The same goes for the Scosche StrikeLine Charge and Sync cables. Two cables were announced, the StrikeLine USB4 High Performance cable and the StrikeLine Cobra magnetic cable.\nCopyright \u00a92024 Android Headlines.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Quiller Media, Inc.\nContact Us | Privacy Policy\nMagnetic cables were a sleeper hit at CES 2024\nMagnetic cables are looking a lot nicer at CES 2024\nWhile everyone is jazzed about the use of AI, self-stabilizing robots, and flashy mixed-reality glasses, on the show floor, we saw hordes of people excited over a new wave of magnetic cables that are preparing to launch.\nAn updated cable isn't exactly a flashy piece of tech, but it's a necessity for everyone. If there's a new evolution that makes them easier to cope with, we're all better for it.\nMagnetic cables aren't wholly new. Supercalla came out with the first versions with visible external magnets years ago and has iterated on them since.\nAt CES 2024, we saw new versions hitting the market from Scosche, Rolling Square, and other lesser-known brands that are rocking a new design.\nThese new USB-C cables have soft, nylon weaving around the outside that obscures the magnetic magic that hides within. The woven exterior is also more durable.\nSupercalla cables have magnets positioned at different intervals which controlled the size of the coils you could make. These new cables have magnets all the way through, adjusting to any size coils that makes sense for you.\nThere is one downside with these new designs though, which is speed. Currently, most cables we saw were limited to only 60W of power.\nScosche and Rolling Square assured AppleInsider that these were only the initial products and they'd have 100W versions launching very soon.\nIt's comical watching the reactions of the passersby at CES when they're entirely unimpressed with AI-powered grills, but they stop and stare at a USB-C cable with hidden magnets.\nThe Scosche Strikeline Cobra will launch this spring, in black and white in 3ft and 6ft versions. Rolling Square will hit the market with equivalent cables. Pricing for both lines has not been released.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design. He started producing vid...\n14 Comments\nAnilu_777\nI like this! I need long cables most of the time but other times they\u2019re a pain. This would be handy for me. And I don\u2019t care about fast charging as I mostly charge overnight.\nentropys\nWhat a good idea.\nexceptionhandler\nThis. It\u2019s such a good idea (magnetic cables) and solves a common immediate problem. \u00a0AI (eg ML) on the other hand, while improving, is more of a solution looking for a problem. Don\u2019t get me wrong, ML is really cool and can be useful sometimes, but we are kind of in the same stage with GPT as IoT was/is (let\u2019s slap a wifi and a cpu on everything to do \u201csmart\u201d things without thinking about does it solve a problem for people). An AI powered grill sounds gimmicky and kinda falls into this category.Im buying some magnetic cables next time I need a cable.\nentropys\nA lot of gear has software labelled AI which in reality is just iterative improvements. Like a ratchet tightening a nut. Too much marketing, not actual smarts.\nmacgui\nThis talks about two different metrics \u2013 speed and power. Care to show the relationship in numbers? What speeds might be expected from a \"60W\" cable versus a \"100W\" cable\"? I'd appreciate some clarity.\nRelated Articles\nApple takes top spot as China stems its smartphone sales decline\nNew figures from Counterpoint Research say that Apple was the number one smartphone reseller in China both in the latest Q4 2023 figures, and across the whole of 2023.\nAd firms are cheating App Tracking Transparency to spy on iPhone users\nDespite Apple's introduction of App Tracking Transparency on iPhone to prevent advertisers gleaning private information, media firms are getting startling details through shady advertising practices.\niPhone dominant in contracting Chinese smartphone market\nIDC reports that Apple's iPhone is the best-selling smartphone in China, achieving a record high market share of 17.3% in 2023, although the market has contracted.\nBest Mac Studio deals\nTop iPad sales\nM2 MacBook Air discounts\nLatest comparisons\niPhone 15 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy S24 \u2014\nspecs, price, & features compared\nM3 vs M3 Pro vs M3 Max \u2014\nspecs, features compared\n13-inch MacBook Pro vs 14-inch MacBook Pro with M3: performance & price - compared\nLatest News\nApple takes top spot as China stems its smartphone sales decline\nNew figures from Counterpoint Research say that Apple was the number one smartphone reseller in China both in the latest Q4 2023 figures, and across the whole of 2023.\nAd firms are cheating App Tracking Transparency to spy on iPhone users\nDespite Apple's introduction of App Tracking Transparency on iPhone to prevent advertisers gleaning private information, media firms are getting startling details through shady advertising practices.\nFuture Apple Vision Pro may look out strain in the user's body\nApple is researching how to make the Apple Vision Pro see if users are sitting properly, and moreover to not blame the headset if wearing it puts a strain on their neck muscles.\niPhone dominant in contracting Chinese smartphone market\nIDC reports that Apple's iPhone is the best-selling smartphone in China, achieving a record high market share of 17.3% in 2023, although the market has contracted.\nOLED iPad Pro screen orders already getting cut, claims questionable rumor\nA questionable report from the supply chain says that Apple has already cut iPad Pro OLED screen orders from one supplier down from what was originally requested, leaving the other supplier unaffected.\niPhone 15 Pro vs Samsung Galaxy S24 \u2014 specs, price, & features compared\nThe launch of the Samsung Galaxy S24 puts the South Korean tech giant against Apple once more.

The company is still headquartered in Ventura County, California, but has grown to over 200 employees and has achieved many significant milestones and successes over those four decades.\nIn 1980, as automotive audio consultants, Roger and Scotia Alves published the Autosound Encyclopedia, which is still considered the \u201cBible\u201d of the car audio industry. By 1984, they had earned their first patent for their General Motors multi-purpose dash kit, revolutionizing the DIY car audio business for retail. EFX, Scosche\u2019s high-end line of car audio accessories was introduced in 1990. Roger and Scotia\u2019s sons Kas and Vince joined Scosche in 1995 and 2000, respectively, and are now Co-Presidents. Kas\u2019 son Ryder joined the family business in 2018 as Marketing Assistant and Video Editor.\nIn 1996 the Alves created the SoundKase\u2122 brand which was the kick-off for a highly successful line, which included: a 12 DVD/CD Visor Organizer, storage cases, seat back organizers, CamKase camera bags, and SoundSak audio backpacks. All SoundKase products utilized a unique and patented non-scratch CD pocket system. This development moved Scosche squarely into the Consumer Technology (CT) Accessories arena, an exciting and successful new direction for the company. By 2005, now firmly established in the world of CT accessories, Scosche introduced BlueLife\u00ae \u2013 the first to after-market streaming audio and hands-free Bluetooth\u00ae car/headphone/home kits.\nWith the growing popularity of Apple\u00ae iPods\u00ae, iPhones\u00ae, and iPads\u00ae, Scosche used their \u201cUser Innovative\u201d inspiration to design and create the \u201cAccessories for Life\u201d consumers needed and wanted.\nAlong with their successful CT business, Scosche continued to innovate on the automotive and audio side, introducing their Realm\u2122 Audio line of high-end headphones and earbuds; and car audio speakers, amplifiers and subwoofers, designed for specialty and custom car audio shops, at the 2007 CES.\nTogether the Alves directed and inspired the first BoomBottle\u00ae portable wireless speaker designed to go anywhere, along with creating the slogan \u201cWhere Do You Take Your Music?\u2122\u201d. Revolutionizing the health and fitness electronics trend, Scosche introduced the MyTrek\u2122 Armband Heart Rate Monitor and app.\nIn 2012 Scosche introduced \u201cAppCessories\u201d \u2013 apps that integrated Scosche products with the sophisticated new smartphones hitting the market at that time. A record seven Scosche products were honored with CES Innovations awards in 2012.\nA huge year for new product releases, in 2012 Scosche amazed CES attendees with a host of new audio products, including headphones, earbuds, and innovative new Bluetooth FM transmitters and portable and rugged BoomBottle Bluetooth speakers. The new smartphones pulled more power, so Scosche responded with powerful portable backup batteries like the FlipCharge\u2122 burst. Numerous mounts, cases and docks for iPhones and iPads were demonstrated that year, as Scosche revealed themselves to be the comprehensive accessories solutions company.\nAs smartphone sales boomed so did Scosche\u2019s ideas for accessories. The Alves reinvented the cell phone mount business with the launch of MagicMount\u2122 line of magnetic mounts for smartphones and other portable devices. By 2015, the popularity of MagicMount had elevated the company to the #1 Mount Brand in North America ranking, as reported by The NPD Group, Retail Tracking Service. Scosche has retained that prestigious #1 Mount Brand spot continuously from 2015 to the present day.\nScosche has always embraced its Southern California roots and the Alves family epitomize the healthy, outdoor life that is reflected in their lifestyle product lines. Partnering with Rockstar Energy Drink in 2017 inspired a special edition of \u201cOptimized for Outdoors\u00ae\u201d consumer technology products designed for an active, outdoor lifestyle. The same year, Scosche\u2019s SafeTech\u2122 Connected Car range was created, featuring a line of award-winning HD Smart Dash Cams, powered by the Nexar\u00ae safe driving app .\nIn 2019, two new Scosche products, the BaseLynx\u00ae Modular Charging System and the MagicGrip\u2122 Wireless Auto-Grip Vent Mount, launched on the Apple website and in Apple stores worldwide.\nAt the 2020 International CES, Scosche is launching more than 150 new Consumer Technology and Connected Car products. Trends change frequently, as do the ways in which people use and interact with technology, so Scosche remains ever nimble. It\u2019s this spirit of innovation and adaptability that started Scosche, and continues to keep their products fresh, relevant, and award-winning, for forty years and counting.\nFun Fact: Scosche has exhibited at every CES since 1984, including this year (Booth# 30306). If you are at the show, you may even have a chance to congratulate Roger, Kas, Vince, and Ryder Alves in person.\nFor more information, visit scosche.com.\nCategory\nPopular Sections\nAbout"
