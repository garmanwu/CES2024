Both chargers feature a vegan leather base, an aluminum housing, and a soft silicone charging puck, and they are able to fold down for travel when not in use.\nSatechi's 3-in-1 stand is able to provide fast-charging capabilities for the Apple Watch Series 7 and later, plus it comes with a 45W USB-C power adapter. Qi2 uses the same magnetic power profile as \u200cMagSafe\u200c, so these stands work like \u200cMagSafe\u200c stands without the 7.5W limitation of the prior Qi standard.\nThe 3-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand will be priced at $130, while the 2-in-1 Foldable Qi2 Wireless Charging Stand will be priced at $80. Both chargers are set to launch in the second quarter of 2024.\nSatechi today also announced the launch of the SM1 Slim Mechanical Backlit Bluetooth Keyboard, the company's first mechanical keyboard option.

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nSatechi Unveils Its First Mechanical Keyboard At CES 2024\nThe SM1 keyboard from Satechi has a mechanical mechanism instead of the more usual membrane design. ... [+] The keyboard ships with Windows and Mac keys.\nIt\u2019s been a while since computer accessory brand Satechi launched a new keyboard. However, the wait is over with the announcement at CES 2024 that Satechi is joining the stampede for mechanical keyboards.\nThe new SM1 wireless mechanical keyboard features a low profile and backlit keycaps. This is Satechi\u2019s first mechanical keyboard that functions seamlessly with Mac and Windows devices. Other brands like Logitech and Keychron have already launched these kinds of keyboards, but this is a first for Satechi.\nThe rechargeable keyboard has a compact 75% layout with low-profile brown switches. The SM1 can connect with up to four separate devices, enabling a seamless transition from computers to tablets or smartphones with just the press of a few keys.\nThe SM1 keyboard from Satechi is wireless and can connect over Bluetooth or 2.4GHz RF using the ... [+] supplied USB dongle.\nThe SM1 supports multiple operating systems, including iOS, iPadOS, macOS, Windows OS and Google Chrome OS. The keyboard ships with Windows keycaps such as \u201cWin, alt, alt\u201d that can replace the factory-fitted macOS CMD and Opt keys.\nSamsung Makes Surprise New Offer To Galaxy S24 Buyers\nGoogle Launches Surprise New Pixel 8 With Free Offer And Big Price Drop\nGoogle Suddenly Reveals Huge Free AI Upgrade For All Android Users\nThe SM1 has 14 different backlight patterns and a dedicated lock screen shortcut for extra security when used on macOS computers. The sleek and ergonomic design is housed in a slim aluminum enclosure and the keycaps can be removed and replaced. To ensure the SM1 can be used at an optimal angle, adjustable feet can be set for the most comfortable typing position to reduce strain on the wrists and hands.\nUnlike some mechanical keyboards, the low-profile SM1 doesn\u2019t offer hot-swappable switches, but its Brown switches fitted to the SM1 provide the smoothness of Red switches and the physical feedback of Blue switches. Brown switches offer an ideal balance and have a short travel distance that can reduce finger fatigue. Brown switches are also quiet, making them suitable for office environments or shared working spaces.\nThis slim and low profile mechanical keyboard from Satechi has white backlights behind each key.\nAs well as providing connectivity with three different devices over Bluetooth, the Satechi SM1 keyboard can connect with a fourth device by using the supplied 2.4 GHz USB dongle. Using RF wireless connectivity, the dongle offers excellent response times compared to Bluetooth. And for those who want a traditional wired connection, the SM1 can do that, too.\nA handy feature included with the SM1 is the use of stabilizers located beneath the delete key, the return key, the space bar and the left shift key. Stabilizers bring more solidity to larger keys that might otherwise rattle when pressed.\nThe SM1 has a 2500mAh rechargeable battery, which is charged via a USB-C port. Using a rechargeable battery means there\u2019s no need for alkaline power cells, which Satechi says is better for the environment. If the battery runs down, the keyboard can be plugged into a computer and you can continue typing while the battery recharges.\nPricing & Availability: Satechi\u2019s SM1 Slim Mechanical Backlit Bluetooth Keyboard is available now on Satechi.net for $99.99. Early shoppers can receive 20% off using the code CES20.\nMore info:"

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.\nShare this story\nOur universal, wireless, magnetic, and fast-charging future is here as the first Qi2 chargers start to arrive, and Satechi is showing off its first two compatible products today at CES.\nBoth devices are folding stands designed to charge a pair of earbuds and a phone \u2014\u00a0using MagSafe or Qi2\u00a0\u2014\u00a0at the same time, while the higher-end of the devices adds an Apple Watch charger to the back. The company said in its announcement that they\u2019ll be available in the second quarter of the year, costing $79.99 for the 2-in-1 stand and $129.99 for the 3-in-1 version.\nSatechi\u2019s new stands fold flat and come with a 45W power supply and two travel adapters for foreign plugs. Satechi even says the 3-in-1 model supports fast charging for the Apple Watches that feature it.\nSatechi exacts a heavy toll with its prices, but that\u2019s been the running theme for early Qi2 charging stands like these. Nomad announced a $100 Qi2 charger, but it doesn\u2019t include the required 20W adapter and only charges a single device. Mophie announced its first Qi2 stands back in September, pricing its 3-in-1 option around $130 as well. And Belkin\u2019s Qi2 3-in-1 charging pad comes in at the same price. But none of those stands fold, so... that\u2019s one way for Satechi to stand out.\nStill, it\u2019s nice knowing that we\u2019re heading into a new world where charging an iPhone doesn\u2019t require careful calculus and research, wires or no.

The new mechanical keyboard has a sleek, ergonomic design with a slim aluminum enclosure, removable keycaps, and adjustable feet for optimum stability and comfort.\nUPGRADE AND MODERNIZE ANY WORKSPACE\nThe SM1 Slim Mechanical Backlit Bluetooth Keyboard\u2019s connectivity, backlight settings, and brown switches provide users with options to customize their keyboard and seamlessly upgrade their workspace. It can accommodate up to four devices at a time which users can easily switch between by pressing the FN key followed by keys 1, 2, 3, or 4. With one press of a button, users can seamlessly go from sending an email on a computer to finishing a grocery list on a phone. Keys 1 and 2 support Bluetooth 5.0 channels, while key 3 utilizes a 2.4 GHz USB receiver to wirelessly connect to an additional peripheral, and key 4 supports wired mode.\nThe new keyboard comes with an adjustable white backlight that supports 14 different patterns and can be easily enabled with a press of the lightbulb key located above the delete key. For unmatched tactile feedback and faster actuation, Satechi employs low-profile brown switches, which combine the smoothness of red switches with the physical feedback of blue switches. Designed to strike the perfect balance between typing and gaming, the keyboard\u2019s brown switches boast a shorter travel distance that reduces finger fatigue and promotes a more comfortable typing experience. They also offer a quieter operation, making them ideal for office environments or shared spaces.\nADJUSTABLE, RECHARGEABLE, ERGONOMIC DESIGN FOR EVERYDAY CONVENIENCE\nPrioritizing user comfort, Satechi made the SM1 Slim Mechanical Backlit Bluetooth Keyboard height adjustable, allowing users to tailor the angle of the keyboard to help reduce strain on the wrists and hands. The adjustable feet also provide added stability, allowing the keyboard to adapt to uneven surfaces and preventing movement while typing. To ensure fast typing and quick response from the keys, the new keyboard has a shorter body and key travel distance. It also includes stabilizers located beneath the delete key, the return key, the space bar, and the left shift key to allow for a uniform key press. Light and compact with a minimalist, low-profile design, the SM1 keyboard is equally effective for on-the-go use as it is stationed in an office or workspace. It comes in a light color variant and is easy to clean, providing an aesthetically pleasing addition to any setup.\nThe keyboard employs a rechargeable 2500mAh battery with a future-proof USB-C port that can be used for both charging and wired mode. Its reversible plug design facilitates easy connection and boasts a durable connector for a longer lifespan. Opting for a rechargeable keyboard over one that requires disposable batteries minimizes environmental waste, making the SM1 keyboard an efficient, eco-friendly solution for all your typing needs.\nCROSS-PLATFORM COMPATIBLE WITH A VARIETY OF DEVICES\nThe SM1 Slim Mechanical Backlit Bluetooth Keyboard supports multiple operating systems including iOS\u00ae, iPadOS\u00ae, macOS\u00ae, Windows OS\u00ae, and Google Chrome OS\u00ae that can be used with a variety of USB-C devices.

        "raw_content": "How-To Geek\nSatechi\u2019s New Thunderbolt 4 Hub Can Also Charge Your Laptop\nThere's also a hub built specifically for the Mac Mini and Mac Studio.\nThe best USB-C hubs can help you connect more devices to your laptop, desktop, tablet, or even phone. More bandwidth is sometimes required, though, which is where Thunderbolt hubs can help. Satechi has now revealed two new Thunderbolt hubs at CES 2024, and they look great.\nSatechi has revealed the Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub Pro (pictured above), an upgraded version of the model released last year at CES 2023. It has the same three Thunderbolt 4 downstream ports with 40Gbps speeds\u2014perfect for fast external storage, high-resolution monitors, and other devices that require a faster connections than USB 3 (and most USB 4 devices) can provide. It's also backwards compatible with Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C devices, and there's native 32Gbps PCIe support for external GPUs and Thunderbolt-based SSDs.\nThe main difference with the Pro model is that it uses a larger 150W power supply, and can charge the connected computer at up to 96W instead of 60W. That's still not enough for some powerful laptops\u2014Apple recommends 140W for the 14 and 16-inch MacBook Pro, for example\u2014but many ultrabooks and tablets won't need a separate power connection when connected to the dock. The hub also provides 15W of power to other connected devices. It has the same \"aircraft-grade aluminum\" portable design as the earlier model, with a Space Gray color designed to match Apple products.\nSatechi also announced an updated \"Stand & Hub for Mac Mini and Mac Studio\" (pictured above), which as the same suggests, is a Thunderbolt hub built specifically for the Apple Mac Mini and Mac Studio. It fits perfectly underneath the Mac, adding font-facing ports and a hidden NVMe storage for more storage. The hub has a USB Type-C 3.1 port, a USB Type-A 3.1 connector, two USB Type-A 3.0 ports, SD and microSD card slots, and an audio jack\u2014all powered by a single Thunderbolt connection to the Mac. It's a great way to add more connectivity to a Mac Mini or Mac Studio without the clutter of a hub or more cables sitting beside the computer.\nYou can buy the Thunderbolt 4 Slim Hub Pro from Satechi's online store now for $100, and the Stand & Hub for Mac mini and Mac Studio is available for $200. For a limited time, you can use code CES20 at checkout on Satechi's online store to get 20% off.\nSource: Satechi\nThe Best Tech Newsletter Around\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nCorbin Davenport is the News Editor at How-To Geek\u00a0and an independent software developer.

[+] business trip.\nI offer no apologies today for highlighting yet another useful computer accessory from Satechi. The company seems to be on a roll right now with some excellent products announced at CES 2024, making working life a little bit easier.\nThe final Satechi product to be announced at CES 2024 is the brand\u2019s 145W USB-C 4-port GaN travel charger. This device could be the only power adapter necessary for a business trip and I\u2019ve had a chance to get my hands on it.\nWith a maximum power output of 145W, the charger has enough muscle to power and recharge almost any laptop while also topping up your smartphone or some other small-scale tech like a pair of true wireless headphones.\nThe new 145W USB-C 4-port GaN travel charger from Satechi has power adapters for EU, UK, Australia ... [+] and USA.\nSatechi\u2019s new charger uses the latest generation Gallium Nitride (GaN) technology, which enables chargers to be smaller and more efficient without compromising on power output. The next-generation GaN technology runs cooler and is more power-efficient than the old silicon-based chargers most of us are used to. Having four power outputs for all your gadgets means the Satechi travel charger can save a lot of space in you carry-on luggage when flying on business trips.\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023\nThe 145W travel charger has a total of four USB-C PD ports. Two ports are USB-C PD 3.1, while the other two are USB-C PD 3.0. Satechi says the charger can safely power up to four devices simultaneously. The PD1 and PD2 ports can deliver up to 140W of power from a single port, which is plenty for recharging and powering even the most advanced USB-C laptop. The PD3 and PD4 ports can deliver up to 45W from one port, making it ideal for charging a tablet or smartphone.\nThis compact charger\u2019s GaN circuitry actively prevents heat from reaching the charger\u2019s exterior case while still delivering a mighty charge. Satechi says the charger can power even the most current-hungry devices, including the 16-inch MacBook Pro, the Lenovo Legion Slim 7i and the Legion 7i. The charger can also charge additional Apple and Windows devices, power banks and peripherals and it\u2019s universally compatible with USB-C PD devices.\nThe small size and low weight of the new Satechi charger means it can plug directly into a power wall outlet without straining the socket. The package also includes four interchangeable power adapters for EU, Australia, UK and US, plus there\u2019s a mesh carrying bag to keep everything together when traveling.\nOne thing worth pointing out with this new charger is that it\u2019s quite heavy and there\u2019s no option to use a cable instead of one of the international adapters. The charger has to be plugged directly into a wall socket so watch out when plugging it into sockets with a loose or insecure grip.\nVerdict: The new Satechi 145W USB-C 4-port GaN travel charger is a beast. It has four USB-C ports and up to 140W available to a single device. It has four international adapters for traveling which makes it perfect for travellers. The GaN circuitry reduces temperature and power consumption, making for a safer charger that won\u2019t fry your gadgets.\nPricing & Availability: Satechi\u2019s new 145W USB-C 4-Port GaN Travel Charger is available now on Satechi.net for $119.99 and early shoppers can receive 20% off using code CES20.\nMore info: Satechi.net"
