The new \u201cPortable Power Supply\u201d product range shows commitment to this new strategy. The DN series \u201cPortable Power Station\u201d is launched by Shenzhen Daran New Energy Technology Co., Ltd., a subsidiary of Mentech, with lithium iron phosphate batteries, bi-directional fast charging, high power solar charging, high power UPS function, and support multiple units in parallel capability.\nThe strong R&D capability ensures that Mentech can continue to provide the market with high-quality, reliable, and lower-cost products. This has earned the company an excellent reputation and a tier 1 customer base. It is reported that Mentech has invested more than 500 million RMB in R&D in this field, and the significant investment has brought a top-of-the-line product range.\nFrom the get-go, Mentech launched five products from DN200 to DN2000, of which DN2000 has a charge capacity of 2073.6Wh and 648,000mAh.\nMentech also pioneered the parallel capacity technology, fast charging technology, and provide a parallel machine display. Up to 6 machines of the same model can be linked where power and capacity can be doubled. The DN series also have UPS function, 110V/220V automatic switching, smart inverter system (two-way inverter technology), high-power solar charging (300W), automatic frequency switching, etc.\nIn addition to high-end technology, DN series products are also called \u201cdesigned to be aesthetically pleasing\u201d, light and compact, simple but elegant design, which is valued by the consumer.\nAt the recent press conference, Mentech said that with the level of hi-tech innovation and smart manufacturing, it insists on providing competitive and high-quality product solutions based on the customer\u2019s needs, realizing value sharing and taking social responsibility seriously.\nThe entrepreneurial journey of Mentech started by the entry of the Internet into the home in the PC era, dial-up Internet access, home broadband, and the 3G-4G era of mobile telecom. Each stage and every new application brings new business opportunities.\nMentech has continuously developed along the upstream and downstream of its main business in the past years. Mentech research and develop the technology of semiconductor chips to obtain strategic control points, providing customers with high-quality products and technical solutions in 5G and network data communication, industrial Internet, smart home, and other application scenarios which gives Mentech a competitive strategy in multiple diverse business units. In fact, the product portfolio of Mentech is continuously expanding through breakthroughs in technology and innovation. Recently Mentech was recognized by leading telecommunication suppliers and become the first supplier to achieve mass production of chip-LAN transformers and take over the mass supply of traditional LAN transformers, changing the industry. The automotive magnetic component products have been highly recognized by some well-known automotive customers at home and abroad.\nNow, with the accumulation of many years of component level technologies and products, Mentech has finally stepped into a consumer product segment. Mentech hopes this will be the first of many smart and green technology products with the consumer in mind.\nAbout the future, Mr. Xianjin Yang, Chairman of Mentech Optical & Magnetic, said that since its IPO, it has been waiting for the opportunity to enter this market segment. This is only the start and probably sends a clear picture on the future direction for Mentech. \u201cOn the one hand, the drive for high-quality products has increased market share; On the other hand, Mentech will focus on new market trends. For example, further strengthen capital operation in the upstream and downstream of the main industry, actively invest the high-quality enterprises, improve and stabilize the industrial chain, and help more high-quality enterprises to accelerate the growth as well.\u201d\nDongguan Mentech Optical & Magnetic Co., Ltd.\ncontact: Kelly Liu\n[email\u00a0protected]\nhttps://www.mnc-tek.com/\n(0086)-769-86921000\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/129718\nEntertainment\nSister Hazel talks about their new single \u2018Love You More\u2019\nWorld\nSingapore transport minister resigns over corruption charges\nWorld\nPakistan says Iran launched deadly air strike on its territory\nWorld\nChina bids to woo back global elites at Davos forum\nBusiness\nOp-Ed: How to pay producers for materials used in AI training \u2014 Cheapskate or not?\nTech & Science\nJapan\u2019s little Moon toy: the camera probe ready to roll\nOn board Japan's \"Moon Sniper\" spacecraft is a little robot with a big mission: to beam images back to Earth.\nWorld\nPalestinians count cost of Israel\u2019s West Bank raid\nIsraeli forces withdrew Friday after raiding the Tulkarem area for almost two days - Copyright AFP MARCO LONGARIPalestinians held funerals on Friday and assessed...\nWorld\nIn Lebanon, strange calls can precede Israeli attacks\nFlames and smoke rise over the Lebanese village of Khiam following Israeli bombardment - Copyright AFP/File TALAR KALAJIANLayal Abou Rahal\u201cGood morning, madame.

Stack said the new facilities will be powered by 100 percent renewable energy provided by Dominion.\n\u201cStack\u2019s forward development in the most challenging markets is our differentiator. Our clients seek speed, scale, quality, and partnership. This new flagship campus exemplifies that,\u201d said Brian Cox, Stack CEO. \u201cI am proud that our development team was able to deploy its expertise while building strong relationships to deliver the on-demand capacity, in key locations, that top technology innovators need.\u201d\nAccording to DgtlInfra, the NVAL2 data center development project is located at 22285 Lockridge Road in Sterling, on the border of Ashburn. The land was (or possibly still is) owned by SDC Ashburn I LLC, itself owned by SDC Capital Partners; The land is also connected to SDC\u2019s Sentinel Data Centers. Whether Stack and/or its owners IPI Partners have bought the land or are leasing the site on a long-term basis is unclear.\nThe news comes after Stack broke ground on a new facility on its other Northern Virginia campus in Manassas, Prince William County, in October. The development is the second phase of expansion and will bring an additional 36MW of critical capacity that will eventually reach 72MW and come online starting in Q4 2022.\n\u201cStack\u2019s development team continues to leverage its relationships with utilities, local authorities, and developer partners to establish a strong, scalable presence in critical markets like Northern Virginia, despite land and power scarcity,\u201d added Tim Hughes, Vice President of Strategy and Development at Stack. \u201cDedication to our clients has driven Stack to secure campus-scale sites and electrical interconnections to allow hyperscalers and enterprises continuous expansion in key markets.\u201d\n2021 saw Stack open a data center in San Jose, California, and announce plans for the facility in Toronto, Canada. It has also opened an office in Singapore in order to expand into the Asia Pacific market.

The land is currently undeveloped, and the filings don\u2019t detail how many buildings the company would be looking to construct. The commission is due to meet to discuss the proposal later this week.\nThe application was submitted by DuPont co-founder Lammot J. du Pont and Vizsla Ventures LLC and includes references to a company known as Vu Ventures LLC. However, a now-removed internal company magazine from engineering firm Gordon Inc. -- which is featured in the planning documents as involved in the project -- notes the connection between the Dulles Berry project and CloudHQ.\nAs part of the original 2018 proposal for data centers on the site \u2013 seemingly filed by an affiliate of QTS \u2013 the owners dedicated a 100-foot wide corridor along the eastern boundary line of the Property immediately adjacent to the Board Run to the county.\nPlans for a Dulles Berry campus have seemingly been in the works since around 2018, according to other filings with the county; it has undergone several revisions involving the site's visual and environmental impacts. The site is features Digital Realty data center campuses to the west and north.\nDuPont Fabros Technology co-founder and CEO Hossein Fateh stepped down from the company in February 2015, and in 2016 founded CloudHQ. The company says it has built and leased 2.4 million square feet and 320MW of data center capacity since its formation. In 2020 Fateh formed Cloud Capital to acquire, manage, develop, and operate data centers.\nCloudHQ has existing and planned data center developments in Ashburn and Manassas, Virginia; London, UK; Milan, Italy; Frankfurt, Germany; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The company is in the process of developing large-scale campuses in Mount Prospect, Illinois, and outside Paris, France.\nSubscribe to our daily newsletters\nMore in North America\nDCD>Connect | New York 2024 Delegate List\nAccelevation Holdings forms data center-focused business unit\nDiscussion\nVIP Private Dinner - by invitation only\nMore in Construction & Site Selection\nData Center Construction Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nCyrusOne seeks planning permission for Dublin data center\nEpisode\nPanel: What really needs to be adapted to accommodate AI at scale & pace\nTags\nWhitepapers\nMore\nImproving data center reliability and efficiency by solving power quality pain points\nSignificant Advancements in Rack PDU Power Quality\nData Center Sustainability Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWorkload Placement Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWatch Now: Building a digital society - What market trends will be driving the industry forward?\nBrowse by Topic\nBrowse by Region\nProducts\nData Centre Dynamics Ltd (DCD), 296-300 St John St, London EC1V 4PAEmail.
