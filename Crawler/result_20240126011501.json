        "raw_content": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\nI saw Reolink\u2019s new ColorX security cameras at CES 2024 and they can do full color night vision without lights\nThe combination of a F1.0 aperture, a 1/1.8\u201d image sensor and ISP technology make this feat possible\nI\u2019m here at CES 2024 this week and while I\u2019ve seen all kinds of weird and wacky gadgets, there have also been some practical ones too, like these new security cameras from Reolink which feature the company\u2019s ColorX true color night vision technology.\nWhen it comes to the best home security cameras and especially the best outdoor security cameras, they capture footage at all hours of the day. If you have a security camera inside your home, it likely uses night vision tech while outdoor security cameras often incorporate lights to produce a color picture. During a real break in or disturbance, these lights can be quite useful but unfortunately, the same can\u2019t be said when a lost pet wanders into your yard at night or bad weather triggers your outdoor security cameras.\nBack in June of last year, Reolink released the first security cameras in its true color night vision ColorX line. By using a F1.0 aperture, 1/1.8\u201d sensor and ISP technology, these cameras can capture footage in full color even at night. The best part though is that they don\u2019t use any lights to do this.\nIt\u2019s one thing to read about something like this or see a video online but it\u2019s entirely different when you see it in-person. Earlier today I had a chance to meet with Reolink at CES and I got to see the company\u2019s ColorX technology in action with my own eyes. I walked away impressed by just how bright the night vision on its security cameras with it built-in were.\nIf you\u2019re tired of having a bright light go off every time you step out into your backyard or front yard at night, A ColorX-equipped camera from Reolink could be the perfect upgrade for your own home security system. Here\u2019s why.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nNo lights necessary\nTo show off the capabilities of its latest ColorX security cameras, Reolink placed two of them inside a box and pointed them at a small cutout of a house. The box was then completely sealed so that no light could get in, though one of the company\u2019s staff members at CES did open it up so that I could take the picture below.\nWith the box all sealed up, I walked around in front of it where one of the best iPads was showing the feed from both cameras in real-time. While one of the cameras came equipped with Reolink\u2019s ColorX tech, the other didn\u2019t and the results really surprised me.\nIf you look at the picture above, you can see that the camera feed on the top was using ColorX while the one underneath it wasn\u2019t and instead relied on black and white night vision. Though it may be difficult to make out some of the more minute details in the picture above, you can still see how the colors pop. The red shutters and door are clearly visible as is the fact that the side of the house is a lighter yellow while the roof is a darker shade.\nWith traditional black and white night vision though, these details are barely visible. Instead, the house looks much darker and a light would be useful in this case. Reolink\u2019s ColorX technology gives you a picture that\u2019s \u201cbright as day\u201d and even shows more colors than are visible to the naked eye.\nSomething like this may not seem like a big deal at first, yet as someone who tests out new security cameras fairly often, it\u2019s the kind of thing you\u2019ll come to appreciate over time. Likewise, you may find yourself wishing you had considered just how annoying the lights on a security camera can be after the fact. I know I\u2019m definitely in the second camp after seeing what Reolink\u2019s ColorX security cameras can do in-person.\nWi-Fi or PoE, the choice is yours\nReolink has a wide variety of different security cameras available depending on how you want to install and use them. The company\u2019s cameras that use Power over Ethernet (PoE) need to be hardwired but because of this, they\u2019re more reliable, especially when you need them most. Even the best Wi-Fi routers go down from time to time but with a PoE security camera system installed at your home, you won\u2019t miss a second of what\u2019s happening inside or outside your house.\nNot everyone has a home that\u2019s wired for Ethernet or can commit to doing an installation like this themselves, though. This is why Reolink also has Wi-Fi security cameras. There\u2019s pros and cons to either setup but the good thing is that if you want full color night vision without the need for lights, Reolink\u2019s ColorX technology is available with both types of security cams.\nFull color night vision without any lights seems to be in the works for security cameras from other manufacturers too, and it\u2019s a trend I\u2019m really excited for. The lights from a security camera can scare off an intruder but it\u2019s always great to have the option to turn them off entirely without sacrificing being able to make out the details in their footage.\nReolink\u2019s ColorX technology is making its way into more of the company\u2019s cameras at this year\u2019s CES, and I was really glad I had a chance to see it in action for myself in person at this year\u2019s show.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

We were lucky enough to be on the ground in Las Vegas and got to see all the exciting newly-released and upcoming products, including a world-first 16MP dual-lens camera and a sneak peek at the eagerly-awaited Argus 4 Pro wireless camera.\nHere\u2019s your guide to everything announced by Reolink at CES 2024.\nDuo 3 PoE\nReolink\u2019s biggest reveal this year was its Duo 3 PoE (Power over Ethernet) camera, an industry-first 16MP dual-lens security camera that boasts a whopping 180-degree field of view by seamlessly stitching the two lenses together. It also supports Reolink\u2019s new Motion Track feature, which maps the trajectory of a person\u2019s movement by stitching together several frames, taken at different points in time, into one single image.\nThe Duo 3 PoE is set to launch in Australia in February, but pricing details aren\u2019t yet known. To learn more, check out our hands-on with the Duo 3 PoE.\nTrackMix Series\nContinuing its focus on dual-lens excellence, Reolink\u2019s TrackMix series is complete with the introduction of two more PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) cameras, the solar-powered 4G TrackMix LTE and the battery-powered Argus Track, both of which use two lenses (one wide angle and one telephoto) to provide clear coverage both at a distance and up close with a 6x hybrid zoom. Like the other cameras in the TrackMix family, the TrackMix LTE (left) and Argus Track (right) are capable of auto focusing and auto zooming on tracked targets, meaning users don\u2019t have to waste time manually controlling the camera.\nThe TrackMix LTE is available now for $519.99, while the Argus Track is coming soon and will retail for $329.95.\nGo Ranger PT\nDesigned for rural properties, farms, and wildlife enthusiasts, the Go Ranger PT is a solar-powered 4K pan-and-tilt 4G security camera with a camouflaged design that allows it to blend seamlessly into the natural environment. It utilises non-glowing (i.e. invisible) IR LEDs which enable high quality footage in low-light settings without disturbing wildlife. It\u2019s even capable of differentiating between different species of animals, including deer and turkeys.\nCurrently, no release date or pricing has been announced.\nArgus 4\nThe next evolution in the Argus series (and the much-anticipated follow up to our favourite security camera, the Argus 3 Pro), the battery-powered Argus 4 introduces 4K resolution and dual lenses that offer a 180-degree view, along with dual-band WiFi 6 capability. As we\u2019ve come to expect from the Argus Series, the Argus 4 will also include colour night vision two-way audio and smart person, vehicle and animal detection.\nThe Argus 4 has not been officially announced, but a Reolink spokesperson told SafeWise it is expected in the next few months, so watch this space.\nVideo Doorbell Battery\nFinally, we got to check out Reolink\u2019s first-ever battery video doorbell. It boasts 2K resolution, person detection, two-way audio, head-to-toe view, and dual-band Wi-Fi. Currently, there\u2019s no word on how much the doorbell will cost or when exactly it will be released, but we\u2019ll likely be waiting at least a few months.\nDisclosure: SafeWise Australia and Reviews.org Australia's coverage of CES 2024 is supported by Samsung, MSI and Reolink.\nRecent Articles\nAboutContact\nHome Security\nSmart Home\nHome Safety\nFamily Safety\nSenior Safety\nCar SafetyInternet SecurityPet SafetyPersonal Safety\nTerms of Service | Privacy Policy | How We Rank and Review |\nWe acknowledge the Traditional Owners of the lands on which we work and live, and we pay our respects to their Elders, past and present.\n*SafeWise has conducted impartial research to recommend products.

The new Reolink Argus and Go series cameras produce more detailed, sharper images with improved color accuracy, making it effortless for their users to identify people, objects, and potential threats.\nHomeowners and small business owners can now experience visuals so lifelike, say goodbye to grainy, pixelated footage and unlock a world of ultra-clarity.

The cameras with a remarkable 355\u00b0 pan and 140\u00b0 tilt range can cover wider areas without compromising details or image quality. This functionality is especially beneficial in large spaces and outdoor environments that require broader coverage areas.\n4K Solar + Spotlights: Argus Eco UltraDon't let darkness obscure the security. Fitted with powerful spotlights, the 4K cameras reveal true-to-life visuals even in low light conditions. When the night falls or the surrounding lights dim, these spotlights illuminate the surroundings and ensure crisp day-like images.
