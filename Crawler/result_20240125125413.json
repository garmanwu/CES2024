        "raw_content": "The Autonomous Home Has Arrived: Experience What\u2019s Possible at CES 2024\nThis blog post was originally published at NXP Semiconductors\u2019 website. It is reprinted here with the permission of NXP Semiconductors.\nAs we enter 2024, the smart home is ready to enter a new era. Thanks to two overlapping trends \u2014 the arrival of Matter, the interoperability standard from the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA), and the growing use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in home control \u2014 it\u2019s never been easier to set up, protect, expand and maintain a home network.\nWe\u2019ve reached the point where everyone, not just tech experts, can do things like turn on the lights using their voice or tap a smartphone app to program the thermostat. We can even define simple rule-based functions, like \u201cturn on the hall lights when the front door opens.\u201d\nAnd yet we\u2019re still selecting and specifying every device action and every device response. What we need is easier ways to add functions that are more autonomous, so we spend less time configuring, controlling and monitoring our environments.\nFrom Smart to Autonomous\nThat\u2019s why we see autonomy as the next transformational stage for living spaces. Moving from a smart to an autonomous home achieves a decades-old vision. Instead of managing individual domains, like lighting, HVAC, security and entertainment, we\u2019ll monitor and control our homes as a whole.\nWhole-home orchestration uses a combination of evolving capabilities \u2013 spatial awareness, interoperability, seamless connectivity, and advanced security \u2013 to create a dynamic, more responsive home environment. In the autonomous home, we can configure our living spaces so they learn from our patterns, anticipate our needs and work behind the scenes to seamlessly make our day-to-day activities more convenient, safer and more energy efficient.\nPioneering the Autonomous Home\nAt NXP, we\u2019re enabling the autonomous home on many fronts. To begin with, we offer one of the broadest Matter portfolios in the industry, so it\u2019s easy to add secure interoperability to devices used in the home. At the same time, we\u2019re working closely with customers and partners across the ecosystem to pioneer system-level solutions that can sense, think, connect and act in response to anticipated user needs.\nNew NXP Platform Accelerator\nAnother way that we\u2019re helping to drive the transition to autonomous home is by making it easier for developers to bring next-generation ideas to life. Our new NXP Platform Accelerator designed in collaboration with one of our platinum partners, the French-American company MicroEJ, simplifies development by bringing cloud-native software techniques, including virtualization and containers, to embedded systems used in smart home, smart city and smart factory applications.\nEnabling Key Trends for Autonomous Home in 2024\nThe intense work we put into creating the NXP Platform Accelerator is already paying off, with industry-leading companies using the platform to create new designs in record time. Building on our innovative solutions, our partners and customers are enabling several key trends that we expect to dominate the market in 2024:\nExperience the Autonomous Home in Person\nThis week at CES 2024 (January 9-12, Las Vegas) we\u2019ll be showcasing many of these new solutions in our Autonomous Home experience. Here are just some of the other Autonomous home experiences visitors will be able to explore at CES:\nThe Promise of Whole House Orchestration\nThe autonomous home experience at CES shows that smart home is transitioning to whole-house orchestration. We\u2019re moving beyond the relatively simple capabilities we\u2019ve come to expect, like controlling appliances with our voice or using a smartphone app to configure lighting controls. What lies ahead is truly intelligent living, with our homes becoming fully integrated environments that can securely and autonomously orchestrate the entire living space.\nTo learn more about how NXP, our partners, and our customers, are working to make whole house orchestration a reality for everyone, visit us at www.nxp.com.\nRafael Sotomayor\nExecutive Vice President and General Manager of Connectivity and Security, NXP Semiconductors\nRecent Posts\nCategories\nHere you\u2019ll find a wealth of practical technical insights and expert advice to help you bring AI and visual intelligence into your products without flying blind.\n1646 N.
