Here\u2019s how it works.\nOnePlus 12 could be the most powerful flagship phone of 2024\nThe OnePlus 12 could be the one phone to rule them all.\nEvery time I look up, a new OnePlus 12 leak makes me giggle at iPhone and Samsung owners. Recently, images have been popping up of the OnePlus 12, with OnePlus now releasing pictures and updates regarding what design changes we will see in the OP 12.\nBased on the OnePlus 12 rumors we have been seeing from many outlets, the OP 12 could end up being one of the most potent flagships on the market, and given OnePlus pricing history, it could be the phone that launches the year of the ditch.\nOnePlus is known for giving consumers flagship-level specs that can compete with Samsung and iPhones but for a better price. However, it appears the maker is looking to provide consumers with ultimate-level flagship specs while keeping its price within reach of most consumers' wallets.\nPricing and availability\nOnePlus hasn't even hinted at what the OnePlus 12 will cost or when it will be launched. However, based on previous launches, we could see the 12 in late January or early February 2024.\nRegarding pricing, OnePlus prides itself on delivering flagship specs at consumer-friendly prices. However, based on the expected specs, we could see a slight bump in price to $799 to start and possibly as high as $899. We also hope to see initial trade-in discounts like with the OnePlus Open.\nOnePlus 12: Features\nMost upcoming flagship phones will come with the latest and most excellent chipsets. For Android phones, it will be the newest Qualcomm Snapdragon 8, and for Apple's iPhone, it will be the Bionic, whatever number it's up to now. However, when it comes to the RAM amount, it usually starts at 8GB of RAM, with 12 and 16GB in higher-end devices. Well, that could be about to change.\nDevices in China are rumored to be moving to 24GB of RAM, which could become the new standard for flagship devices. Leaks for the OnePlus Ace 2 Pro (exclusive to China) are rumored to feature a 6.7-inch curved AMOLED panel with 120Hz refresh, a Sony IMX890 camera module, and 24GB of RAM along with 1TB of storage, which is similar to many current flagship devices, except in the area of RAM, which it blows everyone away.\u00a0So it's not a stretch to imagine its brand sibling arriving with the same rumored 24GB of RAM.\nLeaks of the upcoming OnePlus 12 suggest it could be the first device to launch stateside with this level of performance-enhancing power. The OnePlus 12 is already rumored to come with the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, which will use ARM's next-generation hardware, which few have any details yet.\nAccording to a tweet from insider Kamila Wojciechowska, the new Snapdragon chipset will come with a \"2+3+2+1\" core configuration, which sounds like Qualcomm won't follow Arm's layout recommendations because rebelling creates innovation. Also, the new chipset is rumored to drop 32-bit support after Qualcomm\u00a0delayed the action last year, but it looks like it will be going full-on 64-bit with the new chipset.\n\ud83d\udc09 Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 to come with 2+3+2+1 next-gen Arm cores, Adreno 750, more: leak \ud83e\uddf5 pic.twitter.com/TAYu8GsDtoMarch 23, 2023\nWhen you possibly add 24GB of RAM to the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, a periscope camera, and, in my opinion, the best skin of Android (Oxygen OS), you've got a device few others will be able to challenge, or even keep up with performance wise.\nI almost forgot that the leak also shares that although the OP 12 is similar in most ways to the 11, it will get a 5,400 mAh battery, which is a massive boost over the current 5,00 mAh battery in the 11. Supposedly, the battery will feature 100W fast charging while wired and 50W wireless fast charging. Wireless charging is missing from the 11; there were complaints, so it's nice to see OnePlus address this.\nDuring our review of the OnePlus 11, it lasted 12 hours and 48 minutes at 60Hz, and when we switched to adaptive 120Hz, we got 13 hours and 10 minutes of battery life. So, a larger battery could hypothetically push battery life into the 15-hour range.\nIf all the rumors hold, The OnePlus 12 could be the flagship phone to rule them all.\nOnePlus 12: Design\nWhile amidst all that is Cyber Monday, OnePlus revealed the design and some images of the upcoming OnePlus 12. You will immediately notice that the famous and iconic Alert Slider has been relocated to the lefthand side of the device. This move allows OnePlus to introduce a new integrated antenna and the Alert Slider solution on the new device to deliver an enhanced antenna performance for gaming.\u00a0Also, the emerald green color in the image provided is quite striking.\nAccording to OnePlus, and based on their internal testing, it was determined that the optimal position for gaming antennas is between the forefingers of the user when the phone is held in landscape orientation. However, the Alert Slider has occupied the space on the OnePlus 11.\u00a0OnePlus feels that by relocating the Alert Slider to the opposite side of the phone, better gaming antennas can be deployed on the OnePlus 12.\nOnePlus states that repositioning the Alert Slider presented a challenge in ensuring optimal antenna signal strength on the same phone side. So, to tackle this issue, OnePlus utilized\u00a0Ultra-compact Full-band Antenna technology and industry-first Alert Slider Antenna Integration technology to minimize the space occupied by the Alert Slider to the greatest extent possible. As a result, a balance between better antenna signal performance and the presence of the Alert Slider is achieved on the OnePlus 12. According to the lab test data by OnePlus, the gaming antenna signal can be improved by 3dB, with the game latency reduced by 15%.\nOutlook\nOverall, from the provided images, we can see that outside of the Alert Slider move, the appearance of the 12 is very similar to the 11, which is still one of my favorite designs. Also, having experienced the fantastic image quality that we get with the OnePlus Open, and knowing the 12 will be scheduled to have even better cameras and Qualcomms, already much celebrated Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, the OnePlus 12 will be a flagship that competitors will take seriously.\nOnePlus cemented its foldable phone dominance this year. Will they now topple the likes of Apple and Samsung? Only time will tell, but 2024 could be a fascinating year for mobile devices.\nStay in the know with Laptop Mag\nGet our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox.\nMark has spent 20 years headlining comedy shows around the country and made appearances on ABC, MTV, Comedy Central, Howard Stern, Food Network, and Sirius XM Radio.

        "raw_content": "Upcoming OnePlus Products Releasing In 2024: OnePlus 12, Open 12, Nord CE 5 Lite And More\nIf it weren\u2019t for OnePlus, we probably would have been living in a world where Apple and Samsung dictate the premium smartphone space. Ever since its launch in 2014, the brand has always stuck with the idea of offering something unique at more accessible prices. Last year\u2019s phone lineup served as a good reminder and the list of upcoming OnePlus products in 2024 stays true to the theme.\nOnePlus 12 will kick off the brand\u2019s journey in 2024 and throughout the year, the manufacturers are likely to follow a different path in a rather busy segment bustling with aggressively priced products from rivals. Beyond smartphones, OnePlus will also be revamping its TWS earbuds category as well as stepping into the premium smartwatch segment with the rumoured OnePlus Watch 2.\nSince OnePlus backed out of the smart TV segment, it remains to be seen whether the OnePlus tablets get their due replacements. If you are a fan of all things OnePlus, 2024 is an exciting year to look forward to.\nA decade of defying limits, fueled by bold vision and relentless ambition, has led us to push our own boundaries and conquer complexities.\nIt has built a habit to #NeverSettle, continually crafting innovations that are Smooth Beyond Belief. #OnePlus12Series pic.twitter.com/jq8zQwf8MD\n\u2014 OnePlus India (@OnePlus_IN) January 8, 2024\nHence, if you want to keep a tab on every OnePlus product announcement and their release dates in 2024, our brief yet detailed list could be of immense help.\nUpcoming OnePlus products in 2024\nJump To / Table of Contents\nReleasing in: 23 January 2024\nOnePlus 12 will kick off OnePlus\u2019 innings for 2024 in style. Despite being on sale for a while in China, the device is expected to establish OnePlus\u2019 presence in a segment that is dominated by Apple and Samsung. Featuring the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, the OnePlus 12 is one of the most powerful smartphones money can buy.\nLook beyond the mighty chipset and the OnePlus 12 also impresses with the rest of its features and specifications. Running on the latest version of OxygenOS 14 based on Android 14, users are likely to get a premium experience that doesn\u2019t compromise performance. The Hasselblad-tuned rear camera setup makes big promises and if you seek versatility from your smartphone camera, this could very well be your next pick.\nAdditionally, the 5,400mAh capacity battery should keep the phone going for an entire day with ease and when you need to plug in, the 100W fast wired charger along with the 50W wireless charger should fill it up in no time.\u00a0If OnePlus prices it right, the OnePlus 12 could be among the most value-for-money premium smartphones this year.\n(Image Credits: OnePlus)\nReleasing in: 23 January 2024\nEssentially a OnePlus 11 with watered-down specifications, the OnePlus 12R could once again set off to be one of the most popular performance-oriented midrange phones of 2024. With last year\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 chip at the helm, you are guaranteed the second-best performance on any Android phone today.\nWith a design imitating the OnePlus 12, the OnePlus 12R goes for a metal frame this year to up its ante. The 1.5K resolution OLED display promises up to 4,500 nits of peak HDR brightness and is tuned to detect touch input even with wet hands. The 5,500mAh battery and 100W wired charging should have sealed the deal for many but once you consider its cameras, it may be strictly suited to gamers. The 50-megapixel Sony IMX890 sensor for the main camera along with an 8-megapixel ultrawide sensor and 2-megapixel macro camera should be just enough for casual photography.\n(Image Credits: OnePlus)\nReleasing in: January 2024\nIf you have been frantically hunting for something interesting in the budget TWS earbuds segment, the OnePlus Buds 3 might catch your fancy. Deriving the design and some of the features from the OnePlus Buds Pro 2, this new model promises to offer a premium core experience. The Buds 3 feature a dual-driver setup, an adaptive ANC system, silicon ear tips, touch-sensitive controls and a slim case with a 520mAh battery.\n(Image Credits: OnePlus)\nReleasing in: Mid 2024\nEven though the Nord CE 3 Lite differed from the authentic OnePlus experience, its lower price coupled with an attractive design made it a favourite of entry-level smartphone buyers. Hence, with its successor, we expect OnePlus to churn out another solid entry-level product. Since OnePlus refrains from the \u2018number 4\u2019 in its product lineup, we believe it will be the OnePlus Nord CE 5 Lite.\nAt this time of the year, all we can speculate is that OnePlus could phase out the dated Snapdragon 695 chip and replace it with a modern Snapdragon 6 Gen 1 midrange chip. A 5,000mAh battery coupled with 65W wired charging and a new 50-megapixel main camera could make it a solid deal in its category.\n(Image Credits: OnePlus)\nReleasing in: Mid 2024\nThe OnePlus Nord CE 3 is an unpopular choice in its class despite a decent specifications sheet. For 2024, OnePlus may upgrade the chipset to a Snapdragon 7s Gen 2 and give it a shiny new body to draw customers to the OnePlus stores. Since it belongs to the \u2018CE\u2019 range, the Nord CE 5 could miss out on the Alert Slider switch once again and may be stuck with a tacky plastic unibody design.\nWith a reasonable price, the OnePlus Nord CE 5 could come in as a great alternative to the recently announced Redmi Note 13 Pro and the upcoming Realme 12 Pro.\n(Image Credits: OnePlus)\nReleasing in: Mid 2024\nOnePlus did an impeccable job with the Nord 3 last year. With a 1.5k resolution OLED display with extremely narrow bezels, a highly capable Dimensity 9000 chipset, a 5,000mAh capacity battery and an 80W wired charging solution. However, its camera system wasn\u2019t the best in the segment and the slightly higher pricing pushed it closer to the OnePlus 11R.\nHence, for the OnePlus Nord 5, we can expect a couple of upgrades in all the key areas. The Nord 5 could upgrade to the newer Dimensity 9200 chipset, use a nicer main camera sensor and possibly get a new design that looks more akin to the OnePlus flagship series. With competitive pricing, the OnePlus Nord 5 could be a splendid gaming smartphone in the midrange segment.\n(Image Credits: OnePlus)\nReleasing in: Mid 2024\nThe OnePlus Watch was a controversial start to the brand\u2019s wearable journey in 2021. While the brand switched its focus to the budget fitness tracker segment, rumours are ripe about a premium OnePlus Watch 2.\nUnlike its predecessor, the OnePlus Watch 2 will be a full-blown Wear OS-based smartwatch. This means it will provide access to all Google apps as well as the Play Store to download third-party apps. OnePlus may rely on Qualcomm\u2019s latest smartwatch chipset to power it and you can expect a standard one-day battery life, the latter being the only downgrade from its predecessor.\nWith a standard range of fitness tracking measures, the OnePlus Watch 2 might give the Samsung Galaxy Watch 6 a tough time.\n(Image Credits: OnePlus)\nReleasing in: October 2024\nThe OnePlus Open marked a great start for the brand\u2019s journey into the foldable segment. While the form factor as well as the internal specifications were highly acclaimed by critics and fans, it was the durability issue that plagued its widespread adoption.\nHence, with the OnePlus Open 2, all the brand needs to do is sort out the quality control issues and introduce minor refinements. The Open 2 could get the newer Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset for better raw performance and power efficiency. It shouldn\u2019t be a hassle if OnePlus reuses the Hasselblad-tuned triple camera setup from the Open, given that it had a great camera system that performed well. The same can be expected from the battery life and the convenient fast charging solution.\nHowever, what buyers could demand is a more reliable flexible OLED display, a stronger hinge and further refined ergonomics.\n(Image Credits: OnePlus)\nUpcoming Smartwatches In 2024: Apple Watch SE 3, Galaxy Watch 7, Pixel Watch 3 And More\nHey Google, What Are The Upcoming Google Products Releasing In 2024?\n(Hero and Featured Image Credits: Courtesy OnePlus)\nAmritanshu Mukherjee\nMost popular\nHow To Retrieve Deleted WhatsApp Messages On Android And iOS\nSamsung Galaxy S24 vs Google Pixel 8: Have We Crowned A New King For AI Android Phones?\nEverything We Know About The Samsung Galaxy Ring: Its Features, Specifications And More\nSamsung Galaxy S24 vs iPhone 15: Are The AI Features Enough To Beat Apple\u2019s Flagship?\nYes, I agree to the Privacy Policy"

One of the most popular series for OnePlus, specifically in India, the R-series of phones is meant to offer the best of the company's flagship phones for a more affordable price. With the OnePlus 12R, it's selling for just $499 (or $399 when you trade in any phone in any condition).\nAlso: The OnePlus 12 is everything that the Samsung Galaxy S24 isn't, and I prefer it that way\nI have another week before I can share all of my thoughts on the new OnePlus 12R -- only pictures of the device turned off are allowed for now -- but interested readers can get a taste of what the phone has to offer in ZDNET's\u00a0OnePlus 12\u00a0review.\nWhile at CES 2024, we met with OnePlus to check out both the OnePlus 12 and the 12R and it is impressive to see what OnePlus was able to pack into the OnePlus 12R when compared to the OnePlus 12. Check out the specs comparison below:\nSpecifications\nFor those wanting a OnePlus phone with the ultimate camera experience, then look to the OnePlus 12 with its 4th generation Hasselblad integration. While the OnePlus 12R is not as spec-heavy in that regard, it is also built with gaming and multi-tasking in mind, with the same, powerful cooling system and massive battery that the more expensive option fields. In fact, the 12R features a slightly larger 5,500mAh battery, which is the largest on just about any mainstream phone today.\nAlso: 3 reasons why I ditched my Samsung Galaxy foldable for the OnePlus Open\nThe sub-$500 price point is impressive by itself, but note that OnePlus will also give you $100 off when you trade in any phone in any condition when purchasing the device, making it effectively $399. If you have a phone in good condition, you can get more than $100, too, I'd advise digging through that drawer of forgotten handsets and see how much you get for them.\nIn the meantime, stay tuned for my review of the OnePlus 12R very soon.

        "raw_content": "The OnePlus 12 could be one of 2024\u2019s best Android phones\nOnePlus has had a brilliant year thanks to some great devices. The OnePlus 11 emerged as a comeback in terms of value for money, with high-end features for just $699. It offered a big and bright display, good-quality cameras, excellent performance with clean software, and all-day battery life.\nBut it still had two omissions, which seem to be fixed by the OnePlus 12 that was unveiled in China today. If the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 is anything similar to the Gen 2 in terms of efficiency, the OnePlus 12 could be one of 2024\u2019s best Android phones.\nA truly impressive camera system\nI used the OnePlus 11 as my daily driver for a while, and I was impressed with the overall performance and design. While the OnePlus 12 doesn\u2019t offer a complete overhaul in terms of looks, it\u2019s been upgraded under the hood to offer two key features \u2013 one that I dearly missed having, plus one that appeals to the U.S. market, in particular.\nDespite the presence of three cameras on the OnePlus 11, I missed having 3x optical zoom. The OnePlus 12 sports a new triple camera setup, which not only adds a better telephoto sensor, but also shares the overall camera DNA with the OnePlus Open. The OnePlus 12\u2019s triple rear camera setup is led by a 50MP Sony LYT-808 primary camera with optical image stabilization (OIS). It is accompanied by a 48MP Sony IMX581 ultrawide angle camera and a 64MP OV64B periscope lens with 3x optical zoom.\nIt\u2019s the exact configuration of the lenses as the OnePlus Open, which houses the most versatile camera setup on a foldable phone. I\u2019ve been using the OnePlus foldable phone since its launch, and it has only improved the cameras with each update.\nThe 50MP Sony LYT-808 sensor is impressive on the OnePlus Open. As you can see from the above images, the skin tone is good and there\u2019s ample dynamic range, with no overblown highlights in the cloud \u2014 the overall image looks pleasing. The camera wasn\u2019t very well-tuned for lowlight at launch, but OnePlus has fixed that, too, to some extent.\nWhile the 50MP primary camera captures detailed photos, I was more impressed with the 64MP periscope camera. And that\u2019s because it not only takes good 3x shots, but also performs well up to 15x digital zoom, with great 6x zoom images. When compared to the digital zoom on my iPhone 15 Pro, the OnePlus Open performed better on 6x and up to 15x.\nThe above images show great details and good dynamic range on 3x as well as 6x zoom. Those are some big expectations to have after experiencing the OnePlus Open. But with it having the same camera setup (now tuned with \u201c4th Gen Hasselblad Camera for Mobile\u201d), I\u2019m pretty confident that the OnePlus 12 will be a step up from the OnePlus 11 in terms of camera quality.\nOnePlus brought back wireless charging\nBoth the OnePlus 11 and OnePlus Open had one glaring omission \u2013 no wireless charging. While I didn\u2019t have an issue (because I mostly work remotely in cafes or from sofas), I get the argument of how convenient wireless charging can be for some people. It\u2019s also beneficial when you have several wireless charging pads set up in various places inside your home.\nThe OnePlus 12 brings 50-watt wireless charging to the table. It\u2019s reminiscent of the OnePlus 10 Pro, which was the fastest wireless charging phone in the U.S. at the time of launch. The OnePlus 12 will soon take that mantle as it\u2019s rumored to launch in the U.S.in January.\nThe addition of better cameras and wireless charging makes the OnePlus 12 a complete phone. You should expect a price bump, for sure, but I expect it to be one of the phones to look out for in 2024 given the company\u2019s recent track record and my experience with OnePlus Open\u2019s camera system. The OnePlus 11 was already a great phone, and the 2024 flagship seems to take it up a notch.\nWhat else does the OnePlus 12 offer?\nThe OnePlus 12 features a 6.82-inch QHD+ 2K OLED LTPO display that supports a 120Hz refresh rate. The screen is rated to reach 4,500 nits of peak brightness, which is one of the highest numbers we\u2019ve ever seen. You\u2019ll normally see the phone reach around 1,600 nits, but it can get a lot\u00a0brighter when it needs to. The 4,500 nits level is meant for HDR content; some areas of the screen can go up to that number when required in HDR videos.\u00a0Like the OnePlus Open, the OnePlus 12 display supports Dolby Vision, 10Bit Color Depth, and ProXDR.\nThe OnePlus 12 is powered by the Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, which I\u2019ve yet to test, but I hope it\u2019s at least as efficient as the Snapdragon Gen 2. The OnePlus 12 now starts at 12GB of LPDDR5X RAM instead of 8GB and comes equipped with the same base 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage. It goes up to 24GB of RAM and 1TB of storage.\nThe 2024 OnePlus flagship packs a 5,400mAh battery that supports 100W wired and 50W wireless fast charging. To prevent it from overheating, it sports Oppo\u2019s SuperVOOC S power management chip, which was first introduced on the OnePlus 11R. The OnePlus 12 is rated IP65 for dust and water resistance, which is a step up from the IP64-rated predecessor.\nIn terms of design, the OnePlus 12 doesn\u2019t feature an overhaul, but still has some noticeable changes. First, the alert slider is now on the other side of the phone, so you now get the volume rockers and power button on one side and the alert slider on the other. Second, the green color variant features a wavy pattern on the back. It sure looks good in pictures. The OnePlus 12 comes in three color options \u2014 white, green, and black.\nOnePlus 12 price and availability\nThe OnePlus 12 price starts at 4,299 yuan ($607) in China for the base 12GB/256GB variant, whereas the top-end 24GB/1TB model will sell for 5,799 yuan ($818). It\u2019s a 300 yuan increase from the OnePlus 11, and you should expect a price bump on the OnePlus 12 when it goes global in \u201cearly 2024.\u201d As per previously leaked information, the device is expected to be launched in other markets by the end of January.\nIt\u2019s unclear how much the OnePlus 12 will cost when it eventually comes to the U.S., but if it\u2019s China pricing is anything to go by, it should be quite competitive.\nThe new year is here, and that means a lot of tech to look forward to in the coming months, especially with wearables like smartwatches. And there\u2019s going to be an exciting slate of smartwatches to come, which will pair especially well with the most anticipated smartphones of 2024.\nSo, what\u2019s coming? Here are 5 smartwatches coming out in 2024 that you need to pay close attention to.\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 7\nSamsung Galaxy Watch 6 (left) and Galaxy Watch 6 Classic (right) Andrew Martonik / Digital Trends\nYou probably didn\u2019t expect a flagship smartphone to launch at CES 2024 \u2014 a show where mobile news is usually secondary to TVs, computers, and wearables. But Asus has used its Las Vegas visit to reveal the ROG Phone 8 and ROG Phone 8 Pro, the latest models in its long-running gaming phone range.\nIt\u2019s not just the timing that\u2019s unexpected -- it\u2019s the ROG Phone 8 Pro itself. Yes, it\u2019s an Asus Republic of Gamers (ROG) smartphone aimed at mobile gamers, but it\u2019s also unlike all the others that have come before it. If you expected the ROG Phone 8 Pro to be an all-out, zero-compromise gaming behemoth, prepare to be a little taken aback by what it actually is.\nWhat you need to know about the ROG Phone 8 Pro\nTablets made a comeback during the pandemic, which saw an increase in content consumption and work from home. As a result, several phone manufacturers entered the race to launch tablets. For Google, it was a re-entry, while for OnePlus, it was the start of a new product line. I\u2019ve had the privilege to use and write about these \u2014 as well as other Android tablets, including the Xiaomi Pad 6, Realme Pad, and iPads \u2014 and there\u2019s one thing about tablet design that I'd like to change.\nAfter years of using and reviewing so many tablets, only a few have stood out. One was the Microsoft Surface Pro series, and the other was the Lenovo Yoga Smart Tab. Both of these featured a built-in kickstand, which I believe is an integral part of using a tablet \u2014 and something every tablet should adopt in 2024.\nAll tablets need a built-in kickstand\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

Learn more.\nOnePlus buyer's guide: Everything you need to know about the brand\nAs early as five years ago, OnePlus was barely a blip on the radar of the general tech consumer. Nowadays, the brand is becoming very well-known as a global powerhouse and the maker of some of the best smartphones available. It\u2019s also starting to branch out to other technology markets.\nYou may have heard of OnePlus before but know little about the brand. What\u2019s the company\u2019s history? What products does it offer? What has made it so successful? This OnePlus buyer\u2019s guide will help answer many of those questions and even some others you might not have thought of yet.\nWho is OnePlus?\nOnePlus is a Chinese technology company that primarily makes smartphones. The co-founders \u2014 Pete Lau (CEO, shown above) and Carl Pei (Director) \u2014 started the company in late 2013 (Pei, however, has now left the company to start his own called Nothing). Lau and Pei formerly worked for another Chinese technology brand, OPPO \u2014 a BBK Electronics subsidiary.\nEarly on, it seemed OnePlus was a subsidiary of OPPO. However, both companies denied this. Instead, they each claimed OnePlus acted as its own separate brand. Because of their close connection, though \u2014 and BBK overseeing both of them \u2014 OnePlus had access to various OPPO infrastructures. This helped OnePlus create products cheaply since it didn\u2019t need to invest fully in its own R&D, manufacturing equipment, etc.\nAs an example of this, OnePlus was founded in December 2013 and released its first smartphone \u2014 the OnePlus One \u2014 four months later. Without significant assistance, a company simply couldn\u2019t do something like that.\nIn 2020, Pete Lau became SVP of OPLUS. This parent group oversees both OnePlus and OPPO and intends to bring more brand synergy between the two. In 2021, the companies formally announced their intention to combine forces. The brands will continue to exist independently but will share many resources. For example, OnePlus\u2019 Oxygen OS and OPPO\u2019s Color OS will share the same codebase but have different features.\nWhat does OnePlus offer?\nAs stated earlier, OnePlus primarily creates Android smartphones. In its early days, it was known for making high-powered phones with unique design elements and low prices. We saw this in its first phone, the OnePlus One, which had a starting cost of just $300.\nAs the brand attained more footing in the industry, it slowly raised its prices. In 2023, its standard flagship phone of the year \u2014 the OnePlus 11 \u2014 launched with a $699 price tag. However, that\u2019s still competitive, especially considering the Google Pixel 8 Pro is $300 more and the starting price of a Samsung Galaxy S23 Plus is the same.\nOnePlus differentiates itself from the competition by approaching its design and software from a somewhat minimalist perspective. The company\u2019s smartphones are always simple and elegant, focusing heavily on usability. Its software \u2014 known as Oxygen OS \u2014 used to be frequently heralded as one of the best Android skins ever made. This praise was usually based on how fast, smooth, and bloat-free the software was. Unfortunately, recent releases of Oxygen OS have moved away from this trend, which has polarized fans.\nOnePlus also fully embraced internet marketing and sales from the beginning. Almost all its products are available directly from OnePlus.com, eliminating the need to visit carriers or deal with third-party price markups. However, as time has passed, the company has limited its products to certain areas of the world, which is a sore spot for fans.\nNon-phone products\nOutside of phones, OnePlus also has a limited range of other products. Its first non-smartphone product \u2014 aside from cases, chargers, and other accessories \u2014 was a set of wired headphones known as OnePlus Bullets. These eventually evolved into wireless headphones known as the OnePlus Bullets Wireless. In 2020, the company launched its first pair of true wireless headphones \u2014 the OnePlus Buds. The company quickly followed them up with cheaper variants, the OnePlus Buds Z and Buds Z2. The most recent flagship product from the company in this category is the OnePlus Buds Pro 2.\nIn 2019, OnePlus also launched the OnePlus TV. A few different models have already been released within its TV line with various sizes and feature configurations. The TVs are all powered by a custom skin of Android TV. However, the televisions are only available in limited areas of the world \u2014 mostly India. OnePlus has said the TVs will make their way to more countries \u2014 including the US \u2014 but that hasn\u2019t come to pass yet.\nIn 2022, OnePlus launched its very first tablet, the OnePlus Pad. Interestingly, this product has a centered camera on the rear, which you rarely see on tablets.\nFinally, OnePlus also sells smartwatches. The OnePlus Watch launched in 2021 with primarily negative reviews.\nOnePlus phones: A breakdown of your options\nThere are four categories of smartphones on OnePlus\u2019 roster \u2014 its flagship numbered series, the Nord series, the Ace series, and its newest Open series. Within the flagship series, there are a few subcategories that exist as riffs on the primary phone. The Nord series focuses on the mid-range market, while the Ace series is only available in China and is limited to just a handful of devices as of now. Finally, the Open series is where OnePlus launches its foldable phones.\nThe flagship numbered series\nEach year, OnePlus launches a new numbered flagship phone. In 2024, it\u2019s the OnePlus 12, shown above. In 2023, the flagship was the OnePlus 11. The numbers go down as you move further back by year.\nSince the OnePlus 12 is the flagship phone from the brand in 2024, it features top-of-the-line specs, including the latest Snapdragon 8 Gen 3. It also has the newest and most innovative features from the brand, which strongly align with flagship trends of the year. Notably, the OnePlus 12 also features wireless charging, a feature with which OnePlus has had a strenuous relationship. For years, none of its phones had wireless charging. Then, it finally released a phone with it: the OnePlus 8. Then it took the feature away again, and now it\u2019s back once more.\nRegardless, we expect the OnePlus 12 to be the company\u2019s best non-foldable phone in 2024. If you\u2019ve got the cash and want the best OnePlus has to offer, this is it.\nThe \u201cR\u201d variants\nOnePlus introduced the \u201cR\u201d series in 2021 with the debut OnePlus 9R. At first, \u201cR\u201d phones were trimmed-down versions of the main numbered phone (in this case, the OnePlus 9) exclusively for the Indian market. In 2024, though, OnePlus is taking the \u201cR\u201d line to a broader audience, with the OnePlus 12R being the first to launch in the United States and India.\nAs usual, the OnePlus 12R is a lot like the OnePlus 12, but it cuts out some features and materials to lower the price a bit. One of the biggest trimmings is that it comes with the 2023 flagship processor, the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2. This will make it less powerful than the OnePlus 12 but still with enough power for the average person. It also has a less-capable camera system that, once again, should be fine for most but not as good as the one in the regular OnePlus 12.\nThanks to the trimmings, however, \u201cR\u201d phones are cheaper. The OnePlus 12R, for example, is $300 less than the OnePlus 12, making it a very solid buy.\nThe \u201cT\u201d variants\nIn 2016, OnePlus released the first \u201cT\u201d phone: the OnePlus 3T. This phone looked exactly like the OnePlus 3 launched earlier that year but had a few spec upgrades. This started the trend of OnePlus refreshing its flagship phone line in the second half of the year.\nThe most recent \u201cT\u201d series flagship phone is the OnePlus 10T. This phone trumps the OnePlus 10 Pro with a more powerful (and less power-hungry) processor in the Snapdragon 8 Plus Gen 1. It also charges at a ridiculous 160W. It looks very similar to the 10 Pro, however.\nUnfortunately, the company confirmed that there would not be a OnePlus 11T in 2023. The regular OnePlus 11 remained the flagship non-foldable model of that year. It is unclear, though, if the company is done with the \u201cT\u201d series or if this was just a pause. We\u2019ll know more later in 2024.\nThe Nord series\nOnePlus revealed the very first phone in its new Nord line in 2020. Known simply as the OnePlus Nord, the phone featured many classic OnePlus flagship design elements and specs while dialing back a few aspects to keep the price lower. Since then, the company has launched multiple Nord phones in two different tiers.\nThe Nord 3 launched in 2023 and is the latest numbered flagship model in the line. However, OnePlus also uses the \u201cT\u201d system for Nords, so the OnePlus Nord 2T is out there as well. Unfortunately, these phones are not available in the United States.\nMeanwhile, the Nord \u201cN\u201d series started with the Nord N10 and Nord N100. Globally, these act as the cheapest ways to enter the OnePlus ecosystem. However, these phones are simply rebranded copies of OPPO phones. The Nord N300 and Nord N30 are the newest in the family.\nUnfortunately, OnePlus has confirmed that Nord \u201cN\u201d phones will not receive the same software upgrade commitment as its numbered flagships. The Nord N300, for example, will only receive one Android upgrade before OnePlus will shelve it.\nThe Ace series\nThe OnePlus Ace series is where the company dumps realme clones \u2014 and even clones of its own phones \u2014 in specific markets.\nCase in point, the first Ace phone was the OnePlus Ace, which is only available in very select countries (China, mostly). It is a carbon copy of the realme GT Neo 3, with virtually the same spec sheet. Interestingly, the GT Neo 3 was also the launching point for the OnePlus 10R, making the lineup incredibly confusing.\nThe OnePlus Ace Racing Edition followed, which was also a rebranding effort. The OnePlus Ace Pro, meanwhile, looks just like the OnePlus 10 Pro and OnePlus 10T but is decidedly cheaper.\nThe most recent phone in this lineup is the China-only OnePlus Ace 3. This is essentially a rebranded OnePlus 12R.\nThe Open series\nSamsung still owns the foldable phone market globally, but that doesn\u2019t mean other companies aren\u2019t throwing their own foldable phones into the ring. In the case of OnePlus, it launched its very first foldable phone in October 2023 with the OnePlus Open.\nThe Open is a lot like the Galaxy Z Fold 5 and the Pixel Fold in that it opens like a book. This allows it to exist either as a \u201cnormal\u201d smartphone or a small tablet, depending on your needs at that particular moment. So far, OnePlus has not launched a clamshell-style foldable like the Galaxy Z Flip 5.\nInterestingly, the OnePlus Open is essentially a carbon copy of the OPPO Find N3. Outside of the rear logo and Oxygen OS, the two phones are identical. We expect OnePlus to also launch a clamshell-style foldable that riffs on the OPPO Find N3 Flip at some point, possibly in 2024.\nWhat are the best OnePlus phones right now?\nAre you looking to buy a OnePlus phone? Here are the best OnePlus phones in a few different categories.\nBest overall: OnePlus 12\nThe OnePlus 12 is the company\u2019s 2024 flagship. If you ignore the foldables category, we don\u2019t expect OnePlus to launch anything better than this in 2024. It has the latest and greatest chipset in the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3, an amazing display, a decent rear camera system, and incredibly fast wired charging \u2014 and, for the first time in a while, wireless charging. At a list price of $799, it\u2019s also very competitive against other phones in its class, including the mighty Samsung Galaxy S24 series.\nBest foldable phone: OnePlus Open\nThe best foldable phone in OnePlus\u2019 roster is an easy choice because there is only one: the OnePlus Open. The book-style foldable is a powerful flagship with some standout features, including a terrific camera system. Considering this is OnePlus\u2019 first attempt at a foldable, it\u2019s remarkable how much the company got right on its debut (it being a rebranded OPPO phone didn\u2019t hurt, of course).\nThe OnePlus Open has an MSRP of $1,699, but the company has a permanent deal in which trading in any phone for the Open will result in at least a $200 discount, making its price effectively $1,499.\nBest phone under $500: OnePlus 12R\nIf the $800 OnePlus 12 is a bit too rich for your blood, the next-best phone would be the OnePlus 12R. It runs on last year\u2019s flagship chipset \u2014 the Snapdragon 8 Gen 2 \u2014 but features many of the same specs as the OnePlus 12, including ultra-fast charging. You\u2019ll need to make some quality sacrifices, particularly with the camera, but this is the best OnePlus phone for people who don\u2019t want to spend close to $1,000 on a smartphone.\nBest phone under $300: OnePlus Nord N30\nIf you want to save as much money as possible on a OnePlus phone, you can\u2019t do much better than the OnePlus Nord N30. This phone keeps things simple but still throws in a few perks, namely a 120Hz display refresh rate, a massive battery with very fast wired charging, and a good-enough main camera. Unfortunately, this phone will only receive one Android upgrade, so once it gets Android 14, that will be it. We expect that to happen in 2024.\nBest phone to buy used: OnePlus 9 Pro\nWe could argue all day about which phone is OnePlus\u2019 best ever, but few would argue that the OnePlus 9 Pro would be a strong contender. Even today, it has one of the best cameras we\u2019ve ever seen on a OnePlus phone and has many features modern OnePlus phones lack, such as wireless charging and a full IP68 rating.\nThanks to the phone being older, you can find this used for incredibly cheap, with prices as low as $300. To sweeten the deal, the phone has one more Android upgrade scheduled, so you\u2019ll get Android 14 at some point in 2024.\nWhat sets OnePlus apart from competitors?\nThe smartphone industry is pretty cut-throat. There are a lot of players on the field, and all of them create a very similar product: a flat computer that you keep in your pocket. With so much competition, it can be challenging for a brand to stand out in the crowd.\nLuckily for OnePlus, it has a few characteristics that make it unique in the industry. Even in the various aspects that aren\u2019t unique about it, OnePlus does a great job of nailing the basics of what makes a modern smartphone company successful.\nHere are three things that OnePlus does differently than competitors.\nA limited lineup\nAlthough OnePlus often releases more smartphones each year than it did in the year prior, its lineup is still downright tiny compared to many of its competitors.\nSamsung, for example, releases dozens of smartphones each year across multiple lines, including the Galaxy S, Galaxy Z,\u00a0Galaxy A, and Galaxy M lines. Xiaomi \u2014 a sizable competitor for OnePlus in India \u2014 releases multiple variants of one phone with each release, sometimes ending up with four or five devices all with similar names.\nOnePlus has a smaller roster by comparison. This enables the company to focus more on its devices than some of its competitors. This is a similar strategy to the one adopted by Google, which also releases a very small selection of phones each year. Unfortunately, as OnePlus gets bigger, its roster is also growing. Time will tell if it keeps its roster manageable or if it becomes another Samsung.\nAggressive pricing\nOne of the most contentious topics amongst fans is how OnePlus has raised its pricing over the years. While it\u2019s true that OnePlus phones are more expensive now than ever, the brand\u2019s overall pricing strategy is still competitive. It\u2019s just not releasing flagship-tier phones for $300 anymore \u2014 as it did in its early years.\nWhen you compare OnePlus phones to the bigshots \u2014 especially Samsung and Apple \u2014 it\u2019s plain to see that OnePlus offers a lot for sometimes hundreds of dollars less. For example, the OnePlus 9 had many similar specs to the Samsung Galaxy S21 yet cost $80 less. Even the OnePlus 9 Pro \u2014 which was very analogous in specs and features to the Galaxy S21 Ultra and the iPhone 12 Pro Max \u2014 started at $929, significantly less than those phones. The OnePlus 10 Pro was the exact same price as the Google Pixel 7 Pro, which was heralded as an amazing price for what you get. And, in 2023, the OnePlus 11 was just $699, hundreds of dollars less than its main competitors.\nWhile the days of ultra-cheap yet ultra-powerful OnePlus phones are long gone and likely never coming back, OnePlus hasn\u2019t completely abandoned its status as a wallet-friendly brand.\nWorldwide availability\nWhile it\u2019s easy for anyone to walk into a store and buy a Samsung smartphone, that\u2019s not the case for many other brands. Xiaomi, realme, OPPO, and many other Chinese smartphone makers have zero presence in the United States, for example.\nOnePlus, though, has a footprint in all the major markets, including the US. Being a Chinese brand, that\u2019s a huge differentiator between OnePlus and its competitors.\nGranted, OnePlus is starting to embrace global exclusivity for some of its products. The mainline OnePlus Nord series, for example, is unavailable in the United States and many other countries. The same goes for the OnePlus Ace line. However, consumers across the globe can buy various OnePlus products with ease.\nOxygen OS: What is it, and why is it so popular?\nWe\u2019ve mentioned Oxygen OS a few times already in this article. Without a doubt, Oxygen OS has been one of the biggest reasons OnePlus fans stick with the brand. This is because it has offered an Android experience that most other companies simply don\u2019t offer.\nThe key differentiator between Oxygen OS and other Android skins used to be the company\u2019s minimalist approach. Rather than try to revamp the way Android looks and feels in an effort to \u201cbrand\u201d its phones, OnePlus used to let stock Android do most of the work.\nNot only did this make Oxygen OS a familiar and easily understood experience, but it also kept the operating system fast and smooth.\nUnfortunately, the company has started moving away from its established Oxygen OS feel. With Oxygen OS 11, OnePlus started making the Android skin more similar to Samsung\u2019s One UI. This was highly contentious among fans, who were mostly unhappy\u00a0with the alterations. OnePlus has also started being slower with delivering software updates. To make matters worse, many of those updates come riddled with bugs.\nIn 2021, OnePlus also announced it would be merging Oxygen OS and OPPO\u2019s Color OS. Fans have mostly reacted quite negatively to this, proving that Oxygen OS might not hold the luster it previously enjoyed.\nCompetitors you might want to consider\nWhile OnePlus makes great phones at reasonable prices, there are other companies out there that boast a similar pedigree. As one would expect, though, each brand also has a few caveats.\nHere in the United States, OnePlus competes most directly with Samsung, Google, and Apple. Samsung offers many more phones than OnePlus, but Samsung usually prices comparable products higher than OnePlus. Samsung arguably offers more features, so it depends on how much you\u2019re willing to pay for the kitchen sink approach.\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel phones are another excellent alternative to OnePlus phones. With Oxygen OS falling out of favor, some OnePlus fans are moving to Pixels to keep that stock-like Android feel.\nFinally, Apple obviously has a huge market share here in the US. However, ditching OnePlus for Apple would require switching to iOS, which is not something many fans are willing to do.\nOutside of the US, there is a slew of competitors, even some that are also under the BBK Electronics umbrella. The most notable competitor is realme, positioning itself as the \u201cnew\u201d OnePlus. This is because realme offers high-powered phones with great designs at low prices \u2014 and yes, it\u2019s a BBK brand. However, realme\u2019s roster is much more extensive than the OnePlus roster, and it doesn\u2019t seem that realme has any plans to try to enter the US market, so there are still a few differences.\nThe greatest moments in OnePlus history\nAlthough OnePlus is a relatively young company, it\u2019s had some incredible success in a short time. In less than a decade, the company has gone from nothing to a brand that is used in the same breath as Samsung, Google, and even Apple.\nHere are some of the company\u2019s most important achievements and landmark moments.\nThe launch of the OnePlus One\nThe OnePlus One was the company\u2019s first smartphone and its very first commercial product. One would assume it would take a while for a company to find its audience, but not so with OnePlus \u2014 the One was a gigantic hit amongst hardcore Android users right when it launched in April 2014.\nIn fact, the company found it hard to keep up with the demand for the device. Reportedly, it expected to sell about 50,000 units of the One over its first year but ended up selling over a million.\nLuckily for OnePlus, it had instituted an invite-only system for the One, which helped it regulate supply and demand. Although consumers weren\u2019t big fans of the system, it became a smart move for the company and acted almost like a strange PR stunt.\nThe OnePlus One is one of the most-loved Android phones of the past decade. Despite its age, it still has a sizable user base, and various developers still create and update custom Android ROMs for it.\nThe debut of Oxygen OS\nOriginally, OnePlus used a popular custom Android ROM on its phones called Cyanogen OS. Unfortunately, not long after the launch of the OnePlus One, the company behind the software \u2014 Cyanogen, Inc. \u2014 started making some incredibly bad decisions, which soured the relationship between the two brands.\nAs a result, OnePlus cut ties with Cyanogen and started to make its own version of the Android operating system. The whole debacle was a blessing in disguise, as it bore us Oxygen OS \u2014 the proprietary Android skin of OnePlus.\nOxygen OS is \u2014 without a doubt \u2014 one of the biggest reasons fans have stuck with the brand. Its debut on the OnePlus One was like a breath of fresh air in the smartphone market. Clean, smooth, and unbelievably fast, Oxygen OS acted as an antithesis to other Android skins of the time, many of which were ugly, slow, and bloated.\nHowever, as mentioned earlier, OnePlus has made some controversial decisions regarding Oxygen OS. It is starting to lose fans, so its future is uncertain.\nA partnership with T-Mobile\nIt would be hard to pick just one moment when OnePlus stepped out of its status as a niche brand and into a mainstream one, but its partnership with T-Mobile might be that moment. The agreement saw OnePlus phones \u2014 specifically the OnePlus 6T \u2014 enter a US-based carrier store for the first time.\nOnePlus had had carrier partnerships before its T-Mobile deal, but they had all been outside the United States. With the OnePlus 6T appearing in physical retail shops right next to a Samsung Galaxy S9 and an iPhone XS, the move signaled a new era for the company.\nRemember that OnePlus is a Chinese company and earned this deal during the US/China trade war. Other Chinese companies have been unable to break into the US market at this level.\nBecoming top dog in India\nAlthough OnePlus\u2019 success in the US is very important, its success in India is altogether extraordinary. As of now, OnePlus is one of the top brands in India\u2019s premium smartphone market.\nThat means OnePlus has more control over the premium market in India than heavyweight players such as Samsung, Xiaomi, and even Apple. This is incredibly advantageous, considering India is the world\u2019s second-largest smartphone market and home to over 1.3 billion people.\nWith the launch of the OnePlus Nord \u2014 the company\u2019s first mid-ranger in years \u2014 OnePlus made a big splash in India\u2019s cut-throat mid-range sector, too. Time will tell how OnePlus will handle this, but it\u2019s already made a good start for itself in the premium market.\nThe not-so-great moments in OnePlus history\nNo company rises to the top without a few fumbles along the way, and OnePlus is no exception. Although there have been no high-level scandals that have put the company\u2019s future in jeopardy, there have been some things that have been PR disasters.\nBelow are a few of these issues.\nVery questionable promotions\nIn the early days of OnePlus, the company relied heavily on word-of-mouth promotions rather than traditional advertising. A few of these ended up backfiring on the company for one reason or another.\nAs an example, the \u201cSmash the Past\u201d campaign saw OnePlus encouraging fans to smash apart their current phones and film the destruction. The wording of the contest, though, made it seem like most people who did this would get a new OnePlus phone, but in reality, only a handful would. By the time OnePlus clarified things, hundreds of fans had already smashed their phones to bits. Whoops.\nAnother example of an ill-advised internet promotion was the \u201cLadies First\u201d campaign. This saw OnePlus encouraging female visitors to its official forums to post a picture of themselves with the OnePlus logo. Some of these entries would win an invite to buy the OnePlus One. As one would expect, it wasn\u2019t long before the trolls came out in force, and OnePlus was chastised for the quite obviously bad idea.\nFinally, OnePlus has also received flak for its more legitimate ad campaigns. In 2019, OnePlus revealed it had hired none other than megastar Robert Downey, Jr. to be a OnePlus spokesperson. He would go on to star in India-centric ads for the brand, which reportedly cost OnePlus millions of dollars. While this isn\u2019t the worst thing in the world, fans quickly pointed out that the rising costs of OnePlus phones were helping to pay the millionaire\u2019s salary, which didn\u2019t sit right with them. OnePlus has continued to use Downey, Jr. as a spokesperson, though.\nThe user data breach\nIn early 2018, OnePlus saw a security breach on its website. The breach resulted in sensitive user data getting stolen. This data included information such as emails, physical addresses, and more. To make matters worse, around 40,000 OnePlus shoppers had credit card information stolen, too.\nWhen OnePlus discovered the breach, it temporarily shut down all payment transactions on its website. Unfortunately, the damage had already been done.\nThis wasn\u2019t the first \u2014 nor the last \u2014 time that OnePlus has seen a data breach of some kind, but this was certainly the biggest one that caused the most damage.\nA poorly chosen company slogan\nSince day one, the official slogan for OnePlus has been \u201cNever Settle.\u201d At first, the slogan made perfect sense as the company was pushing out the OnePlus One, which was a phone with multiple top-of-the-line specs for just $300.\nOver the years, though, \u201cNever Settle\u201d has come to bite back at OnePlus. As prices for its phones started to creep up to normal flagship levels, the devotion of OnePlus to its mantra came into question. Other decisions have also caused fans to mock the slogan, such as the across-the-board removal of the headphone jack, the lack of wireless charging and IP ratings in the majority of its lineup, and the inability to get certain phone models in various countries.\nIn hindsight, \u201cNever Settle\u201d may not have been the best choice of slogan.\nMerger with OPPO\nIn 2021, OnePlus announced the beginnings of \u201cOnePlus 2.0.\u201d At the time, the company tried to play this off as a positive shift for the brand that would make it leaner, faster, and able to offer more to its customers for less.\nHowever, this was all a smokescreen for what was really happening: the swallowing of OnePlus into OPPO.\nWhile a company merging with another company isn\u2019t always bad, OnePlus is starting to lose its identity. Oxygen OS is now pretty much a clone of OPPO\u2019s Color OS, which robs OnePlus of one of its most significant strengths. Various bits of evidence strongly suggest that OnePlus is not getting the same R&D funds and support as OPPO, pushing OnePlus to be more of a sub-brand than its own distinct entity.\nSince the merger, OnePlus phones have faced middling reviews, and fans are already moving on. It could be that in just a few years\u2019 time, OnePlus won\u2019t even be a blip on the radar anymore.\nA few other OnePlus details to keep in mind\nIf you\u2019ve made it this far, you now know a lot about OnePlus. Hopefully, this information will help you make informed buying decisions when it comes to your next smartphone, TV, or other electronic device.\nHowever, there are a few miscellaneous things related to OnePlus that you should also know. Here\u2019s a quick roundup:\nFrequently asked questions about OnePlus\nIf you want a device in its flagship numbered series, you should expect to spend around $800 on the latest from its roster. If you are just looking for the most basic of experiences, the OnePlus Nord N30 starts at around $299. If you\u2019re looking to get the most value for your money, used flagship OnePlus phones from the previous year can usually be found for $400 or less.\nThe OnePlus 12, OnePlus 10 Pro, OnePlus 9, OnePlus 9 Pro, and OnePlus 8 Pro are the five phones from the brand with wireless charging. All other devices in the company\u2019s history are wired charging only, including the 2023 OnePlus Open and OnePlus 11.\nSince 2018, all flagship phones from the company come without headphone jacks. However, the OnePlus Nord N family has devices with headphone jacks (the mainline OnePlus Nord phones do not).\nIf you\u2019re buying a phone unlocked directly from OnePlus, the only phones you can get with an IP rating are the OnePlus 12, OnePlus 12R, OnePlus 9 Pro, and OnePlus 8 Pro. Notably, the OnePlus 8 5G UW from Verizon has an IP rating (but all other OnePlus 8 models don\u2019t). Similarly, the OnePlus 8T Plus and OnePlus 10 Pro from T-Mobile have IP ratings, but all other similar OnePlus models don\u2019t. There is no 2023 phone from OnePlus with an official IP rating.\nNone of the company\u2019s flagship phones have expandable storage, but some of the budget OnePlus Nord N devices do. It is unlikely a OnePlus flagship will ever launch with expandable storage, though.\nOnePlus is its own brand, so it makes all phones bearing the OnePlus name. However, some phones are rebranded versions of other phones launched by sister brands. The OnePlus Open, for example, is a rebranded OPPO Find N3.\nBeing a Chinese company, most OnePlus phones are made in China. However, the company is huge in India and has manufacturing and R&D centers in that country, too.\nOnePlus keeps its in-box accessories minimal. When you buy a OnePlus phone, it usually only comes with the phone itself, a USB cable, a wall charger, and a SIM tool. Most of the time, there is a not-so-great screen protector pre-applied to the phone, and sometimes a protective case is included. Other items are usually not included with OnePlus phones, including headphones, headphone dongles, mounts, stands, etc.\nEach OnePlus phone comes with a limited one-year warranty that starts the day the phone ships. You can add more coverage and/or extend coverage by purchasing a third-party insurance plan, which OnePlus offers you during the checkout process. Starting with the OnePlus 8 series, OnePlus promises three Android upgrades and four years of security patches for its flagships. The exceptions here are the OnePlus 11, OnePlus 12, and OnePlus 12R, which have promises of four Android upgrades. Unfortunately, for its new budget entries in the Nord N series, the software upgrade cycle is much lower with just one upgrade and two years of security updates.\nNo. OnePlus has a large presence in the United States, Europe, and many other countries, so your phone returns and repairs would be handled in the country of purchase. In some rare cases, OnePlus might issue you to a third-party repair service, but it would never ask you to ship a phone to China.\nOnePlus sells products via its online store in the US, Canada, almost all of mainland Europe, the United Kingdom, China, India, Australia, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Hong Kong, Vietnam, and a few others. Generally, there are very few areas of the world where OnePlus doesn\u2019t offer sales and support."

        "raw_content": "OnePlus 12 vs Samsung Galaxy S24: Comparing The Upcoming 2024 Android Flagships\nThe early months of 2024 will see two brand-new smartphones dominating the headlines. On one side, we will have the OnePlus 12 continuing the lineage of OnePlus\u2019 value-friendly yet dripping-with-features line of \u2018flagship killers\u2019.\nThough the OnePlus 12 will be released in China on 4 December 2023, it\u2019s expected to take just a few months before being optimised for global markets. The leaks and rumours have already painted a highly tempting picture of this upcoming flagship and we can barely wait to compare it with Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24, which too is waiting to unleash its dominance over this highly competitive and prestigious segment.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 is apparently coming in early 2024, way before the OnePlus 12 breaks cover for international markets. Not to mention, after two long years, we might see the return of the Exynos-branded high-end chipset on Samsung\u2019s flagship Galaxy S series. The design is also likely to be touched up and you can expect to see more developments in other key areas.\nAll the leaks and rumours surrounding these two flagship smartphones have got us so excited that we can\u2019t resist doing an in-depth comparison of the OnePlus 12 vs Samsung Galaxy S24.\nSo, sit back and relax as we dive into all of the pros and cons of these two upcoming goliaths.\nOnePlus 12\u2019s specifications (rumoured)\nChipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3\nDisplay: 6.7-inch 2K AMOLED with a 1\u2013120Hz variable refresh rate\nOS: OxygenOS 14 on Android 14\nRAM: 16GB LPDDR5X\nStorage: 256GB UFS 4.0\nFront Camera: 32-megapixel front camera\nRear Cameras: 50-megapixel Sony LYT 808 main camera, 50-megapixel ultrawide camera and 64-megapixel telephoto camera with 3x zoom.\nBattery: 5,400mAh\nCharging: 100W wired, 50W wireless\nSamsung Galaxy S24\u2019s specifications (rumoured)\nChipset: Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy / Exynos 2400\nDisplay: 6.2-inch 1080p AMOLED with a 1\u2013120Hz variable refresh rate\nOS: One UI 6 on Android 14\nRAM: 8GB\nStorage: 256GB UFS 4.0\nFront Camera: 10-megapixel front camera\nRear Cameras: 50-megapixel main camera, 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and 10-megapixel telephoto camera with 3x zoom.\nBattery: 3,900mAh\nCharging: 25W wired, 15W wireless\nOnePlus 12 vs Samsung Galaxy S24: The pre-launch comparison\nFor this comparison, we will be evaluating these phones on the same key aspects as seen in our product reviews. Keep in mind that this comparison is purely based on leaked information and some of the specifications mentioned here are subject to change.\nOnePlus Open vs Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 5: The Battle Of The Best Flagship Foldable\nAll OnePlus Smartphones In Order Of Chronology: From OnePlus One To OnePlus 11\nDesign\nBoth OnePlus and Samsung have adapted Apple\u2019s strategy of sticking to one design language and refining it over successive generations.\nThe OnePlus 12\u2019s leaked renders reveal a nearly identical design to the OnePlus 11, complete with its \u2018black hole\u2019 inspired camera module and curvy edges. As such, the flagship device is likely to continue featuring a curved-edge display and a punch-hole selfie camera. OnePlus is expected to launch the phone in colours like green, black and white.\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 is also expected to feature a design near-identical to the Galaxy S23, including the droplet-style rear camera lenses and minimalist aesthetics. The leaked renders also reveal glossy flat metal sides that are highly reminiscent of the iPhone 13 Pro\u2019s form factor. It is also rumoured that the display size could grow marginally to 6.2 inches from the S23\u2019s 6.1 inches, partly because of Samsung opting for slightly slimmer bezels.\nBased on these leaks, it seems like both smartphones will be equally appealing to the eyes. It remains to be seen if things change once they are released.\nWinner: Tie\nDisplay\nThis is an aspect where the OnePlus 12 is going to win by a tiny margin.\nThe OnePlus 12 is rumoured to feature a 6.8-inch OLED display made by BOE, promising 2K resolution and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz. In comparison, Samsung\u2019s Galaxy S24 is rumoured to feature a compact 6.2-inch 1080p OLED display with a variable refresh rate of 1Hz-120Hz. Both smartphones will feature an in-display fingerprint scanner but Samsung will use an advanced ultrasonic fingerprint sensor that works with wet fingers too.\nWhile the Galaxy S24 will have a superior fingerprint scanner, the OnePlus 12\u2019s larger and higher resolution display will make it preferable to the masses.\nWinner: OnePlus 12\nPerformance\nWhile both of these flagship offerings will benefit from the performance of the mighty Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset, it is the Samsung Galaxy S24 that\u2019ll be the likely winner in terms of overall performance, courtesy of its customised architecture.\nUnlike the OnePlus 12 which will use the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 in its natural form, the Galaxy S24 will use an overclocked Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 for Galaxy variant that will theoretically be faster. Additionally, rumours also suggest that Samsung may introduce the Galaxy S24 with an Exynos 2400 chipset this year.\nThe same holds true for the software.\nSamsung\u2019s One UI 6 based on Android 14 is aesthetically pleasing, more refined and full of smart features, thereby giving the Galaxy S24 a premium appeal. OnePlus\u2019 OxygenOS 14, which is already available on the OnePlus 11, also promises smooth and fast performance but it lags behind in terms of aesthetics and overall features.\nWinner: Samsung Galaxy S24\nCameras\nThe OnePlus 12\u2019s camera system is shaping up to be quite promising.\nWe expect OnePlus to continue harnessing its partnership with Hasselblad for another year by fine-tuning its updated camera hardware. The phone is likely to feature a new 48-megapixel Sony LYT808 image sensor for the main camera, accompanied by another 48-megapixel ultrawide camera and a new 64-megapixel Omnivision OV64B telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom.\nHowever, software optimisation is everything and this is where Samsung is expected to have an edge over the OnePlus 12.\nThe Galaxy S24 is expected to retain the same camera hardware as the Galaxy S23, which means we could, once again, see a 50-megapixel main camera, a 12-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 10-megapixel telephoto camera with 3x optical zoom. The clever tuning should also help Samsung\u2019s camera system excel at video recording.\nFor now, the OnePlus 12 seems to have an advantage (at least on paper), but we won\u2019t be surprised if Samsung pulls out the win when the phones actually come out.\nWinner: OnePlus 12 (on paper)\nBattery\nIn this department, the OnePlus 12 is likely to walk all over the Galaxy S24.\nIt is rumoured that OnePlus is expanding its battery capacity from the standard 5,000mAh to a larger 5,400mAh and when paired with the more power-efficient Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chip, the OnePlus 12 could deliver incredible battery life.\nMoreover, OnePlus is expected to offer a 100W wired fast charging solution and will likely come with a charging adapter in the box. This 100W system on the OnePlus 12 promises to fill up the battery in less than 30 minutes! The phone is also rumoured to get support for a 50W proprietary wireless charging system.\nAs for the Galaxy S24, Samsung might continue to offer the same 3,900mAh battery as the Galaxy S23 and that should amount to all-day usage IF the user exercises caution. Samsung is also expected to limit the wired charging to a 25W system and the wireless charging to a 15W system. You are also unlikely to get a charging adapter in the box due to Samsung\u2019s green initiatives.\nWinner: OnePlus 12\nOnePlus 12 vs Samsung Galaxy S24: Our verdict\nAfter going through this exhaustive comparison, it looks like the OnePlus 12 commands an unprecedented advantage over the Galaxy S24.\nBe it the bigger and higher resolution display, its massive battery capacity, a superfast charging system or a promising camera set-up, the OnePlus 12 seems to be ahead of the Samsung Galaxy S24 in terms of hardware. Like every year, OnePlus\u2019 flagship remains unbeatable on paper.\nHowever, Samsung\u2019s expertise from its decades of experience is usually seen in the overall refinement and finesse of its devices, especially in the software department. It may seemingly have inferior hardware but the Galaxy S24 could be a champion at optimising it tremendously, just like Apple\u2019s iPhone 15. Hence, we aren\u2019t putting the Galaxy S24 down until Samsung makes all of its features and specifications official.\n(Hero and Featured Image Credits: Courtesy OnePlus and Samsung)\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\u2013 What is the difference between the specifications of the OnePlus 12 and the Samsung Galaxy S24?\nWhile both the OnePlus 12 and Samsung Galaxy S24 will be based on the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 platform, the OnePlus 12 will have a larger display with advanced camera sensors, a bigger battery and a much faster charging system.\n\u2013 What is the difference between the cameras of the OnePlus 12 and the Samsung Galaxy S24?\nThe OnePlus 12 is likely to feature a combination of a 50-megapixel Sony LYT 808 main camera, a 50-megapixel ultrawide camera and a 64-megapixel telephoto camera with 3x zoom.

        "raw_content": "Android Police\nOnePlus' January hardware launch event could be busier than we thought\nNew earbuds and a budget tablet are likely on the agenda\nSummary\nOnePlus ranks among the top Android phone manufacturers in the business, and the company is rumored to be taking things up a notch with its first-ever foldable smartphone, the OnePlus Open/Fold. However, supply chain issues have pushed its launch from the initially expected mid-August timeframe to probably sometime later this month. Looking towards the future, though, OnePlus has a ton of new devices in tow, such as the OnePlus 12 and OnePlus 12R. Rumors have largely pointed to a January 2024 announcement timeline for these next-gen phones, and we're now learning about two more products possibly launching alongside these flagships.\nThe manufacturer will launch the recently leaked OnePlus Pad Go, as well as an unnamed pair of earbuds, according to MySmartPrice, citing information obtained from leaker Yogesh Brar. It's up to anybody's guess as to what these earbuds would be called, especially given the relative confusion surrounding OnePlus' available list of earbuds. With this in mind, it could either be the OnePlus Buds Z2 refresh or a successor to the OnePlus Buds Pro 2, as both were launched at around the same time earlier this year.\nTo be clear, OnePlus hasn't scheduled a launch event just yet. But considering the fact that the manufacturer released the OnePlus 11 in January this year, it's a fair guess that the brand will follow a similar timeline for the OnePlus 12 series, plus the tablet and earbuds revealed by this new leak.\nAlthough we're still likely around four months out from the OnePlus hardware launch event, the rumor mill has been buzzing with information on the OnePlus 12, with some details on the OnePlus 12R also available. In July, leaked renders suggested that the former will look fairly identical to its 2023 predecessor, which was corroborated by another leak this month.\nThe flagship will also likely feature the same 6.7-inch 2K AMOLED LTPO screen, aided by a 120Hz refresh rate. Internally, the BBK-run brand will include Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 SoC, 256GB of UFS 4.0 storage, and up to 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, with a 24GB variant said to be in the works.\nMeanwhile, another July leak revealed unofficial renders of the OnePlus 12R and some hardware specifications to go with it, suggesting that the company may retain the fan-favorite alert slider for another year. Some rear camera improvements were also mentioned, with OnePlus supposedly ditching the 2MP macro camera in favor of a 32MP telephoto unit with 2X optical zoom. The rest of the rear camera hardware is rumored to stay the same as the OnePlus 11R, including a 50MP primary camera and an 8MP ultrawide sensor on the back, with the manufacturer reportedly retaining the 16MP selfie camera from the last-gen model.\nAs for the tablet mentioned by Brar in this new leak, recent leaks have only revealed that it would be known as the OnePlus Pad Go, in addition to its model numbers \u2014 OPD2304/OPD2305. The Go branding suggests that this may be a budget-oriented offering, potentially positioned as a wallet-friendly alternative to the OnePlus Pad.\nAlthough the design won't be for everyone, the OnePlus 11 is the company's best phone in years. It combines excellent specs, incredible battery life, and a competent camera system, all for just $700. While some enthusiasts might miss out on the fast wireless charging from last year's OnePlus 10 Pro\u00a0\u2014 and OxygenOS 13 remains a shell of its former self\u00a0\u2014 this is a big step in the right direction for the company.\nSubscribe to our Newsletters!\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nChethan Rao is a news writer at Android Police, primarily focusing on weekend news coverage for the site.

It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

        "raw_content": "Android Police\nBest of CES 2024: Android Police\u2019s awards for the world\u2019s biggest tech show\nThe best tech we've seen during CES 2024\nNew year, new tech. The tech announcements come thick and fast whenever a new year rolls around, and a big part of that is because CES always happens in January. CES 2024 has been no different, and we\u2019ve seen many new devices announced over the last week in Las Vegas.\nAndroid Police\u2019s editors have been exploring the floor at the show to find the most interesting tech at the world\u2019s biggest tech show. We\u2019ve seen see-through TVs, more and more uses of AI, lots of robots, and software changes across Google\u2019s products \u2014 and that's before we even mention the weirdest tech we saw at CES. We\u2019ve put together our favorite products of the whole show in one place, so without further ado, here are the best gadgets of CES 2024.\nAsus ROG Phone 8 and 8 Pro\nTwo new gaming phones excited us this year\nThe Samsung Galaxy S24 isn\u2019t the first big phone reveal of the year \u2014 that honor has gone to the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro, which was revealed during CES. There are two models from Asus this year, and we\u2019re excited about both of them. It seems the company has been trying its best to refine the gaming phone experience to match what you expect from other flagship devices, too. These are 15% thinner than the previous devices, and the design is much sleeker than previous iterations.\nThe phones are both IP68 water- and dust-resistant, which surprisingly is a first for gaming phones. To make that happen, Asus has chosen to lose the cooling vent we\u2019ve seen in previous iterations. The big highlight for many will be the improved camera specs, which include a 50MP main camera, a 13MP wide camera, and the introduction of a 32MP telephoto for the first time with 3x optical zoom.\nThe Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro packs the best hardware, from the Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 running the device to its FHD OLED high framerate screen. It's a powerhouse of a smartphone that's capable of chewing through the most demanding mobile games, and it comes with a price to match, with the Pro models starting at $1200 and going all the way up to $1500 if you require 24GB RAM and 1TB storage.\nAsus ROG Tessen Mobile Controller\nOur second pick from Asus is its new smartphone gaming controller\nYeah, Asus has had a remarkably strong CES 2024 for mobile gaming. Alongside its new flagship gaming phone, the ROG Tessen controller was also revealed, which is here to compete with the likes of the Razer Kishi V2 and Backbone One. This is a foldable gaming controller, so it can slot into your bag with ease, and it\u2019ll work with various phones so you can pull it out and plug it in whenever you want to play.\nAsus obviously wants you to use it with the ROG Phone 8 Pro, but we\u2019ve been assured this will work with all USB-C phones. There are features like RGB lighting, but the beefy and durable design is why we\u2019re excited about this one. From our time with the controller so far, we\u2019re hopeful it\u2019ll be comfortable to use for long gaming sessions.\nThe\u00a0Asus ROG Tessen mobile gaming controller is designed to work with all USB-C Android phones, and it's a durable controller you can put into your backpack to take on journeys where you may want to use it for long gaming sessions.\nDreamebot X30 Ultra\nOur favorite smart home gadget of the show is this anti-tangle robot vacuum\nRobot vacuums are great, but while they take the pain out of cleaning up your home, many of them still need to be cleaned themselves regularly to ensure top performance. The Dreamebot X30 Ultra is designed to take one of those stresses away as it features its own hair detangler. If you have any long-haired residents or pets in your home, you\u2019re probably familiar with how clogged up a vacuum can get with hair.\nThe anti-tangle brush should be helpful, but it seems the Dreamebot will be one of the most thorough robot vacuums on the market as it features cleaning that can go as deep into corners as 4 centimeters, so if you\u2019re looking for a capable robot vacuum keep an eye out for this one. Pre-orders begin February 28 for $1,700, but we\u2019ve yet to hear an exact release date.\nThe DreameBot X30 Ultra features the company's first-ever self-cleaning base capable of emptying both the mop and vacuum portions of the robot. Using the same MopExtend technology Dreame has used in other models, its circular mop pads are capable of articulating to reach even the most awkward spots in your home. All of this comes with a new anti-tangle brush and\u00a08,300Pa of suction power, making it an advanced and practical option.\nJBL Live 3\nNew touchscreen controls for JBL's latest earbuds\nWe loved last year\u2019s JBL Tour Pro 2 earbuds, and a big part of the reason why was down to the introduction of a touchscreen case. Now, JBL has deemed that feature a success and it\u2019s bringing it to its more mainstream Live series. The JBL Live 3 all feature touchscreen cases, and these come in three different types so you can pick your favorite form factor of earbuds.\nThere\u2019s the Live Buds 3 which are stemless buds with 40 hours of battery life; the Live Beam 3, closed-type earbuds with 48 hours of battery; and the Live Flex 3 are open-type and feature 40 hours of battery life. The highlight is that new touchscreen case that allows you to interact directly with your music to change volume, switch tracks or even change audio profiles without touching your main device.\nJBL Live 3 earbuds feature a smart touchscreen case that offers volume and playback controls, audio profile switching, and many other user-selectable features. The earbuds are available in three designs: Flex, Beam, and Buds; each offering slightly different specs. All of them offer\u00a0ANC powered by six microphones, support for most major high-res codecs including LDAC and Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio, JBL Spatial Sound and Personi-Fi 3.0, wireless charging, and multipoint support.\nSamsung Music Frame\nThe next stage of Samsung's The Frame\nEveryone loves Samsung\u2019s Frame TVs, which try their hardest to look like anything but tech, with chunky borders, a matte screen, and the option to display art when idle. Now Samsung is applying that same principle to a speaker. The Music Frame is a 12.9 x 12.9-inch square frame with space for a physical art print, all to hide the two woofers, two tweeters, and two midrange drivers that sit inside and pump audio out.\nThis may sound familiar, as it\u2019s pretty much a smaller, squarer take on Sonos and Ikea\u2019s Symfonisk Picture Frame, but it may have one killer advantage: Samsung says that the picture will be customizable when the Music Frame eventually goes on sale, which hopefully means more choice than the limited range of art Ikea offers.\nSamsung's The Frame technology is moving on from TVs to speakers now, and this is the first edition we've seen from the company. It'll show whatever you want it to on the screen, but many people who visit you home won't know that it's also a speaker.\nSennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds\nHealth tracking tech, but in your ears\nYou already have health-tracking tech in your phone and your watch, so why not your earbuds too? Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum Sport buds are the latest to attempt just that, squeezing in heart rate and temperature sensors to help record your performance during workouts. You can then sync that data with apps from Garmin, Strava, Peloton, and Polar, giving you the freedom to workout without a watch - or just double up your data.\nAs you\u2019d expect from sports buds, these have an IP55 rating, so they should handle a bit of sweat just fine. The buds have a semi-open design combined with ANC, so you can hear as much (or little) of the outside world as you feel fit.\nThe Sennheiser Momentum Sport earbuds are built for workouts, with an IP55 rating and the ability to track both your heartrate and temperature as you exercise. Together with a semi-open design and active noise cancelation, these could be a runner's dream headphones.\nTCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro\nOur favorite tablet of CES 2024\nAs the name oh-so-subtly hints at, TCL\u2019s NXTPAPER 14 Pro is the company\u2019s latest tablet to use TCL's novel display tech that replicates the look and feel of paper.\nNo, this isn\u2019t E Ink, but it\u2019s almost as easy on the eyes, with a matte finish and blue light filtering built in \u2014 and with much less of a compromise to image quality when it comes to gaming or watching movies on the spacious 14-inch panel. And with 12GB of RAM, a giant 12,000mAh battery, and a decent MediaTek Dimensity 8020 chip inside, you\u2019re not compromising on performance either.\nThe NXTPAPER 14 Pro is a huge Android tablet with a paper-like display, and the option to switch between between full color, color ink, and monochrome ink modes depending on whether you want the full Android experience or to settle in and use it as an ereader.\nWithings BeamO\nWithings doesn't just make watches\nYou probably know Withings for its analog-esque ScanWatch trackers, or maybe its sophisticated smart scales, but the company makes more health tech than that.\nAt CES it unveiled the $250 BeamO, a four-in-one device that hopes to put your local doctor out of business. Withings has somehow packed a thermometer, ECG, pulse oximeter, and even a stethoscope into a device the size of your TV remote. In fairness, you can measure all of these at home already \u2014 but not from one device, with electronic output you can send directly to your doctor, in a form factor that makes it easy for the whole family to use.\nThe Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 at-home health tool that can monitor your body temperature, heart rate, blood oxygen levels, and heart rhythm, outputting them all in a friendly digital form that you can sync with other health apps or even share directly with your doctor.\nSubscribe to our Newsletters!\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nJames is the Editor-in-Chief of Android Police, where he helps the team cover everything mobile technology and beyond.

        "raw_content": "Best of CES 2024: From 4K Projectors to Neural Headphones, Here Is the Best Tech to Look Forward to This Year\nThe Consumer Electronics Show features thousands upon thousands of tech products and we narrowed it down to the best.\nBy\nRudie Obias\nRudie Obias\neditor\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\nEvery year, the best and brightest companies in tech come to Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show \u2014\u00a0otherwise known as CES \u2014\u00a0to announce and showcase new entertainment, audio & video, wellness, household and transportation products for the year ahead.\nOver five days at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels and casinos, we visited booths, press conferences, presentations and participated in countless tech demos to find the best of the best of CES. These brands and products were chosen based on usefulness, function, innovation and overall cool factor.\nWe narrowed down the winners in a number of categories from laptops to robot vacuums and smart home devices to 4K TVs. We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar. The LG Soundbar S95TR is a 9.1.5-channel sound system that comes with 65-inch soundbar with three up-firing speakers, rear speakers and a subwoofer for your TV, while the system is Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and DTS:X compatible for immersive and detailed audio. It also connects wirelessly to just about any LG 4K TVs via WOWcast.\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nIf you\u2019re alone, but needed a portable solution to dynamic Zoom video calls or just making a TikTok video, the Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit is a very cool and useful way to make self-tracking videos with your Apple iPhone.It\u2019s MagSafe and NFC (Near Field Communication), so all you have to do is attach your iPhone and Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro will track and follow your body and face. During our time with the product, it appeared to move smoothly and effortlessly with 360-degree rotation and 90-degree tilt. wMeanwhile, it has up to five hours of use per charge and works in-app with TikTok, Zoom, Instagram and more.Belkin has it priced at $179.99, while the tech company has yet to announce availability.\nMaster & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic partnered with a neuroscience company called Neurable to deliver a pair of wireless headphones that can your track work sessions and measure your stress levels through your brain waves through a mobile app. They can even recommend when you should take a break when you\u2019re deep into your work.Aside from their focus capabilities, Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones offer premium audio quality with active noise cancellation and up to 32 hours of battery life per charge. The headphones are available for pre-order for $649 with delivery in early 2024.\nJBL Live 3 Earbuds\nNot only do the JBL Live 3 Earbuds feature world-class audio that crisp, clear and rich with active noise-cancellation, they offer something that most premium wireless earbuds do not \u2014\u00a0a charging case with a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen display. Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line. It has an AMOLED touchscreen display that comes in three case sizes (42mm, 47mm and 51mm), while the watch comes with an LED flashlight, a heart rate monitor, blood oxygen monitor, step and calorie counter and a built-in GPS with up to a whopping 16 days of battery life per charge.In our brief testing period, the Garmin Epix Pro appeared to be durable and solid since it\u2019s made with premium materials, such as stainless steel, a fiber-reinforced polymer, a steel rear cover and Corning Gorilla Glass. It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung have unveiled transparent TVs at the show, with LG having just announced its OLED-powered display will go on sale later this year.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u2019s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode.\n\u201cThe unique thing about OLED is it\u2019s an organic material that we can print on any type of surface,\u201d explains David Park from LG\u2019s Home Entertainment Division.\n\u201cAnd so what we\u2019ve done is printed it on a transparent piece of glass, and then to get the OLED picture quality, that\u2019s where we have that contrast film that goes up and down.\u201d\nContent is delivered wirelessly to the display using LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box which sends 4K images and sound.\nWhy would you need a transparent TV?\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, the OLED T can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\nSamsung\u2019s transparent MICRO LED-powered display showed off the technology as a concept.\n___\nADS COMING TO SHOPPING CARTS\nFood companies advertise all over the grocery store with eye-catching packaging and displays. Now, Instacart hopes they\u2019ll start advertising right on your cart.\nThis week at CES, the San Francisco-based grocery delivery and technology company is unveiling a smart cart that shows video ads on a screen near the handle. General Mills, Del Monte Foods, and Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream are among the companies who will advertise on the carts during an upcoming pilot at West Coast stores owned by Good Food Holdings.\nInstacart says a screen might advertise deals or show a limited-edition treat, like Chocolate Strawberry Cheerios. It might also share real-time recommendations based on what customers put in the cart, like advertising ice cream if a customer buys cones.\nInstacart got into the cart business in 2021 when it bought Caper, which makes smart carts with cameras and sensors that automatically keep track of items placed in them. Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"
