Please pay attention to the airflow control. Try to use small volume airflow on the surface of the acrylic or apply the side blow method, make sure there is also airflow at the bottom of the acrylic plate as well.\nDie-board:\nFocal length and Airflow are key factors for Die-board cutting. We suggest utilizing the focal lens with over 100mm focal length. Such a focus path will make the knife slit\u00a0more precise.\nFaster cutting speed requires greater airflow on the material surface.\u00a0The smaller the nozzle mouth applied, the more cutting power you will get.\nMDF:\nThe faster-cutting speed requires greater airflow over the material surface.\nLeather & Fabric:\nLaser power between 60W-100W is suggested and also equipped with a focal lens of 50 FL and a small power air compressor.\nWood:\nThe faster-cutting speed requires greater airflow over the material surface.\nPVC & Dual-color Board:\nLaser power between 60-100W is suggested and also equipped with a focal lens of 50 FL and try to control the output power between 50%-70%.\nSteel:\nSteel cutting will need Oxygen support during the cutting process. Air Pressure:0.8 MPa.\nPaper:\nLow laser power and fast speed for paper cutting are highly recommended. There is no perfect power and speed for multi-types of machines, get the correct power and speed on your test, please.\nArtificial Rubber:\nNormally, rubber cutting is a single-layer process, the reference we offered in this table is based on a double-layer cutting test.\n------------------------------------------\nPlease don't be hesitate to contact either our pre-sale service online or any account manager you familiar with for your questions or concerns.\n400-9933-360\nSales@yl-laser.com\n+8615904432231\n1588 Ya\u2019an Road, Hi-Tech North District, Changchun, Jilin Province, China 130102"
