The highly-integrated Wi-Fi 7 family of chips offers an industry-first single-SoC solution that delivers more than 70% higher tri-band throughput verses Wi-Fi 6. The chips are currently sampling to selected partners and MaxLinear-enabled products are expected in 2023.\n\u201cOur Wi-Fi 7 single-chip solution enables fast, robust, and reliable connectivity elevating the user experience,\u201d said Will Torgerson, vice president and general manager, Broadband group for MaxLinear. \u201cWe help our partners reduce complexity, drive form-factor innovation, and spend less time designing next generation gateways, routers and access points.\u201d\nWi-Fi 7 - also called Extremely High Throughput (EHT) - is one of the most significant Wi-Fi upgrades to date. Built on the IEEE 802.11be standard, it delivers 11.5Gbps of peak throughput on the 6GHz spectrum. This makes the throughput more than twice as fast as the previous generation, Wi-Fi 6. This increase is accomplished by doubling the bandwidth to 320MHz and enhancing the modulation to 4096 QAM.\nMaking the untethered experience more robust, Multi-Link Operation (MLO) is another marquee Wi-Fi 7 feature which enables channel aggregation to deliver lower latency and higher throughput in congested environments.\nMaxLinear Wi-Fi 7 advantages include:\nJoin the MaxLinear team and help shape the future of networking and communications technology."

AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design.

(Nasdaq: MXL), a leading provider of high-performance radio frequency (RF) and mixed-signal semiconductor solutions, announce MaxLinear's MxL1550 RF transceiver and Intel's Agilex(R) 7 FPGA F-series device have successfully achieved 32.44 Gbps data rates during JESD204C interoperability testing, unleashing 400MHz instantaneous bandwidth RU applications.\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20230627276868/en/\nMaxLinear Achieves 32.44 Gbps Data Rates in Successful JESD204C Interoperability Testing (Graphic: Business Wire)\nJESD204C is a multi-lane, multi-gigabit serial interface for high-throughput digital communications between RF transceivers and logic devices. MaxLinear\u2019s JESD204C conforming implementation is based upon best-in-class SerDes innovations and delivers industry-leading 32.44032 Gbps lane speeds. Such JESD204C interface speeds are required to support the development of new ultra-wideband radio units (RU) for the 5G Radio Access Network (RAN). According to 2023 research by Research and Markets, the global 5G RAN market was valued at $12.4B billion in 2022, and is projected to reach $57.1 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 21.1% from 2022 to 2030.\n\u201cImplementing high-speed JESD204C SerDes interconnect between RF transceivers and FPGAs is a significant new design challenge for RF engineers delivering next-generation 5G radios,\u201d said Gerry Leavey, Senior Director in MaxLinear\u2019s Wireless Infrastructure Group. \u201cBy achieving 32.44 Gbps JESD204C interoperability in advance with a leading FPGA product from Intel, MaxLinear is facilitating the rapid development of right-first-time 400 MHz RU designs based upon our MxL1550 Octal RF transceivers.\u201d\nThe MxL1550 is a state-of-the-art, low power octal RF transceiver that supports up to 400MHz instantaneous bandwidth for next-generation 5G Macro, Massive MIMO, and Small Cell radio applications. Coupled with ultra-low power consumption, this multi-channel RF transceiver is a key component for meeting the power consumption, size, performance, and cost requirements of next generation 5G radios.\n\u201cIntel Agilex 7 SoC FPGAs deliver ~2x performance per watt compared to competing 7nm FPGAs1, making it an optimal and scalable product family for thermally constrained RU environments. Combined with MaxLinear\u2019s RF transceivers, we unleash 400MHz instantaneous bandwidth efficiently supporting wideband/multi-band RU applications,\u201d said Christian Lanzani, Director of the Wireless Business Division, Intel Programmable Solutions Group. \u201cThis collaboration, along with Intel\u2019s cutting-edge suite of radio IP and ORAN/Low-PHY enablement solutions, helps our wireless clients drastically reduce development time and costs while enhancing the feature sets and delivery of power-efficient RU solutions.\u201d\nMaxLinear provide a range of development platforms and tools based upon the HiTek Systems Agilex eSOM module and carrier board to allow developers to evaluate these solutions and speed up development.\nMore about the JESD204C Interoperability Platform\nThe successful 32.44 Gbps JESD204C interoperability test was successfully confirmed using an RU reference design platform consisting of a MxL1550 evaluation board connected to an Intel Agilex 7 FPGA F-Series device with F-Tile on a Hitek Systems\u2019 eSOM evaluation system. This RU hardware platform, combined with MaxLinear\u2019s ultra-wideband digital pre-distortion (DPD) IP and Intel\u2019s O-RAN and Low-PHY IP suite, delivers a complete programmable pre-verified software-defined radio (SDR) with the highest integration and lowest power consumption for Macro and Massive MIMO RU applications. The RU reference platform includes the following technical components from Intel and MaxLinear:\nTo allow developers to evaluate these solutions and speed up development, Intel and MaxLinear provide a range of development platforms and tools based upon the Hitek Systems\u2019 Agilex eSOM module and carrier board.

Getting in touch with a local window installer is the best way to get an accurate cost estimate for your home.\nHow Installing Energy-Efficient Windows in Ashburn Saves You Money\nThere are several benefits of switching to energy-efficient windows. A few reasons you may want to consider making the switch include the following:\nEstimated Cost of Window Replacement in Ashburn\nWindows come in different styles, purposes and shapes, so costs and services will vary remarkably depending on several factors. Below, we go over the average cost and services that you'll find from window installation companies.\nHow Much Do New Windows Cost?\nAccording to our research, the national average cost to replace a single window is around $600. However, window replacement costs can range from $200 to $1,200 a window. But costs will vary significantly depending on your location, the number of windows you need, the current condition of your home and the quality of your products. Many window companies also offer door installations and other add-ons like shutters, coating, baths and more. These extra services will increase your overall project costs.\nWhether or not you want to install energy-efficient windows is another factor that will determine the cost. These will almost always cost more than other windows, but on the other hand, you can save about $353 a year on your energy bills in Ashburn.\nGetting free quotes from multiple companies is the best way to find out which one will work best for your budget.\nWhat Services do Window Installers Offer?\nThe first step when planning a window replacement is to decide whether you want a full-frame or pocket installation.\nFull-frame installations involve replacing the whole window \u2014 the sill, frame, trim and all. These are most common when you want to change the style of your window or when it has significant deterioration. Full-frame installations are more time-consuming and will increase overall costs. A pocket installation involves replacing a window within the frame that's already there. So, instead of tearing out the whole window and rebuilding it, the contractor will just put the replacement window (also called a retrofit or insert window) into the frame.\nYour window installation company should be able to help you choose which type of installation you should get.\nBest Availability\nBest Energy-Efficient Features\nWindow Veteran\nHow We Choose the Best Window Installers in Ashburn\nIn our hunt to make your home improvements easier and more eco-friendly in Ashburn, EcoWatch landed on the above companies as the best window installation companies in the city. Along with energy efficiency, we reviewed window companies all across the state and ranked them based on the following methodology:\nService Area\nBecause this is a guide for Ashburn, we only included companies that cover the city. There are other reputable providers that didn't make our list because of the low odds that they would serve the average homeowner in Ashburn.\nWork Quality\nWe're certain that you're looking for professionals who do a great job installing windows. We've vetted each installer included in our guide to ensure its technicians are well-qualified and that the company has received plenty of positive customer feedback to vouch for its service.\nCustomer Reviews\nAnother self-explanatory yet very important review factor is customer feedback. If most customers don't have positive things to say about their experience with a certain company, you won't see it featured on EcoWatch.\nCost\nCheaper windows certainly don't mean better windows, but we know many of our readers want to keep costs as low as possible. When analyzing the prices of providers, we awarded higher scores to companies with reasonable prices and accessible financing rather than \"cheaper\" services.\nWarranty\nProtecting your investment in new windows is important. For that reason, window installation companies that give you lengthy warranties for products, parts and labor rank higher with EcoWatch.\nYears of Experience\nBecause of Ashburn's climate, homeowners need to be wary of water damage, rot and low efficiency. We factored in local experience to reflect the ability of Ashburn window companies to prepare homes for the climate. If a company has less than 10 years of experience, it loses points in this category.\nAshburn, VA Window Replacement FAQs\nHow much does a window install cost?\nThe average cost of installing a single window can range between $450 and $650. There are a variety of factors that affect how much it costs, including your property's location, the materials used in designing the windows, how energy-efficient the windows are, local labor costs, styles and sizes of windows and the number of windows.\nWhat are the types of windows?\nThere are several different kinds of windows you can get for your home, including slider windows, double-hung and single-hung windows, picture windows, casement windows, awning windows, bay windows and transom windows.\nDo you really need to use a window installation company?\nYou should hire a window installation company whenever you need to replace your windows. Installing windows is a involved process that can be difficult and time-consuming, so it's best left to the professionals.\nHow do you know it's time to replace your windows?\nWindows typically have a lifespan of around 20 to 30 years, but anytime you notice damage on your windows, it's a good time to have an expert take a look at them to see if they need any repairs or replacements.\nShould I replace my windows all at once?\nIf your windows are more than 20 years old, it's probably time to replace all of them. By that point, they are usually less efficient, leakier and/or more damaged than new windows. Replacing your windows all at the same time will involve less paperwork and less time.\nOther Services in Ashburn\nMore window replacement & installers Near Me"
