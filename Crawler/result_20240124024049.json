Januar 2024\u00a0 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0KONKA Group Co., Ltd. (\u201eKONKA\"; 000016.SZ), ein f\u00fchrendes Technologieunternehmen, hatte einen bedeutenden Auftritt auf der International Consumer Electronics Show (CES), die vom 9. bis 12. Januar 2024 l\u00e4uft. Das Unternehmen stellte eine Reihe seiner f\u00fchrenden Displayprodukte vor und demonstrierte die hohe technologische Kompetenz und \u00fcberragende Leistung der Marke.\nDas 310-Zoll-MicroLed 4K-Plus Movie Theater von KONKA bietet eine \u00fcberragende Farbkonsistenz, die den Marktdurchschnitt \u00fcbertrifft und ein einheitliches und hochwertiges Seherlebnis garantiert. Durch die geringen Bildschirmreflexionen von weniger als 5\u00a0% ist es perfekt f\u00fcr Kinoumgebungen geeignet. Mit einer Helligkeit von 800\u00a0nits und einer hohen Bildwiederholfrequenz liefert das Display eine brilliante und flie\u00dfende Darstellung. Die Farbpalette ist dank der von KONKA entwickelten und vollst\u00e4ndig propriet\u00e4ren lichtemittierenden Chips beeindruckend. Diese Chips erreichen 85\u00a0% von BT.2020 durch eine kontinuierliche Optimierung der Licht emittierenden Wellenl\u00e4nge. Auf diese Weise werden Farbabweichungen bei weiten Betrachtungswinkeln effektiv reduziert und das Seherlebnis insgesamt verbessert.\nIn Chongqing, China, hat KONKA eine Produktionslinie f\u00fcr MLED-Direktbildschirme und eine Vielzahl von Mini-LED-Direktbildschirm-L\u00f6sungen in gro\u00dfem Ma\u00dfstab eingerichtet. Damit verbessert KONKA seine F\u00e4higkeit, vielseitige L\u00f6sungen f\u00fcr ein breites Spektrum von Umgebungen bereitzustellen, darunter Flugh\u00e4fen, Kinos, zentrale Daten\u00fcberwachungsr\u00e4ume, Verkehrsleitzentralen, Einkaufszentren und zahlreiche weitere Szenarien.\nW\u00e4hrend des Events pr\u00e4sentierte KONKA auch sein Flaggschiff\u00a0\u2013 die Modellreihe\u00a0809, eine Mini QD-LED TV-Modellreihe, die seit 2023 auf dem Markt ist. Die bahnbrechenden Funktionen dieser Reihe erm\u00f6glichen ein wahres Fest f\u00fcr die Sinne. Sie verf\u00fcgt \u00fcber die neuen Mini QD-LED- und AGLR-Bildschirme, die den nativen Kontrast stark verbessern und die Bildschirmreflexion minimieren. Das Ergebnis ist eine transparentere und \u00fcberw\u00e4ltigende Darstellung. Der Mini QD-LED vereint die \u00fcberragenden Vorteile von QLED und Mini LED und liefert st\u00e4rkere Kontraste und sattere Farben. Dies erm\u00f6glicht eine detaillreiche Wiedergabe von Filmen und Spielen. Zudem wartet die Modellreihe mit einem extrem hohen Kontrastverh\u00e4ltnis von 10.000.000:1, einem 157-prozentigen ultraweiten BT.709-Farbraum und einer hohen Helligkeit auf.\nKONKAs neue Generation der OLED-Fernseher der Modellreihe\u00a0812 und seine Modellreihe\u00a0813 im mittleren Preissegment wurden au\u00dferdem vorgestellt. Die Modellreihe\u00a0812 ist mit den Betriebssystemen webOS und Google\u00a0TV ausgestattet und erf\u00fcllt damit die weltweiten Verbrauchererwartungen an die Content-Verf\u00fcgbarkeit.\nDie \u00fcberragende Produktqualit\u00e4t und die beachtliche Innovationskraft von KONKA, die von der propriet\u00e4ren Technologie unterst\u00fctzt wird, sto\u00dfen sowohl innerhalb der Branche als auch bei Verbrauchern auf Anerkennung. Im Jahr\u00a02023 stieg der Umsatz des KONKA-Markengesch\u00e4fts um 101\u00a0% im Vergleich zum Vorjahreszeitraum, w\u00e4hrend der Umsatz in der TV-Kategorie ebenfalls ein substanzielles Wachstum von 32\u00a0% im Vergleich zum Vorjahr verbuchte. Mit Blick nach vorn wird KONKA seine Gesch\u00e4ftsphilosophie beibehalten und die Globalisierung der Marke weiter vorantreiben.\nInformationen zur KONKA Group Co., Ltd.\nDie KONKA Group Co., Ltd. wurde am 21.\u00a0Mai\u00a01980 gegr\u00fcndet und ist seit 1992 an der Shenzhen Stock Exchange notiert.
