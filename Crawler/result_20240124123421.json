Here's how to choose.\nCamera Gear Guides | Camera Guides\n| By Jeff Collier\nThis guide to the best Insta360 cameras of the year so far will help you choose the exact product for your needs.\n360-degree cameras are so much fun, but they can be pretty expensive.\nThankfully, Insta360 have brought them to the masses with their (more) affordable pricing and wide product range.\nDoes everything you could want from a 360 camera in a compact body with great battery life.\nInsta360 action cameras also make a great alternative to a GoPro for immersive POV video footage.\nI own the first version of the Insta360 Go, which I wouldn\u2019t recommend, and my son-in-law owns the Insta360 X3, which I\u2019d definitely recommend.\nYou see, each of these cameras is slightly nuanced with its features, so it\u2019s really important to understand the quirks before you buy.\nLet\u2019s jump into the guide.\nTable of Contents\nWhat is the Best Insta360 Camera in 2024?\nInsta360 X3 (Our Top Pick)\nInsta360\u2019s flagship consumer offering is an action camera and 360 camera in one. It\u2019s small, so you can carry it around easily and/or clip it to your body, a car or motorbike, using one of their accessories.\nIt\u2019s weather resistant and waterproof up to 33ft.\nBoasting dual \u00bd inch 48-megapixel sensors, the Insta360 X3 can record 360-degree footage at a whopping 5.7K and still photos at a massive 72-megapixel resolution!\nUsing only a single lens to shoot wide-angle POV footage still gives you 4K capabilities too.\nOne of the coolest features is the Insta360 X3\u2019s Invisible Selfie Stick. Each camera takes in 210 degrees of view. This creates an overlap, and a sweet spot where the camera, held away from the body, can\u2019t be seen.\nCombine this with the AI-drive \u2018Me\u2019 mode, and you\u2019ll look as if you\u2019re being filmed by a drone, from any angle. Third-person POV!\nIt also has a 360-degree horizon lock, so no worries about wonky worlds (unless you want them), and market-leading FlowState image stabilization.\nWith its 2.29-inch touchscreen, it\u2019s a breeze to preview footage and navigate the menu. And once you transfer your footage from the camera to your phone, the Insta360 app has a plethora of features that will take it to the next level.\nThere\u2019s AI Auto Framing, Auto Tracking (to keep a subject in the centre of the frame), a photo animator, and an AI Storyteller feature that lets you stitch your footage together using creative templates.\nInsta360 1-Inch 360 Edition (Highest Quality Video)\nThis, for the serious consumer, is a mighty, mighty camera, as you\u2019d expect from something co-engineered by Leica.\nIt\u2019s the first Insta360 to have dual 1-inch sensors, and as such, it provides incredible image quality and dynamic range.\nDue to the size of its sensors, the Insta360 1-Inch works extremely well in low light conditions, picking out all the details other cameras might miss.\nLike others in the range it has 360-degree horizon lock, and Insta360s bespoke, AI-assisted FlowState Image Stabilization, so shaky footage is a thing of the past.\nIt also incorporates the brand\u2019s Invisible Selfie Stick feature, meaning you can record fantastic third-person views, and anyone watching would think it was filmed by a drone.\nIt has a long-life battery, which should give you up to 60 minutes of recording time shooting 6K video at 30fps. Of course, if you\u2019re not using the device at the top range of its capabilities you\u2019ll get significantly more shooting time.\nA unique feature of this camera, and one that separates it from the pack, is its Leica lenses and the fact that these are interchangeable.\nThis gives you the kind of flexibility of a modular device like the Insta360 One RS. No more being limited by a single type of lens.\nInsta360 One X2 (Best Value)\nThis is a rugged, waterproof action camera for the user who doesn\u2019t want to fork out a huge amount of cash.\nIt\u2019s long-lasting when fully charged, and has over double the battery life of its immediate ancestor, the Insta360 One X.\nThe Insta360 X2 has great audio capabilities. With its four mics and a newly-designed smart wind-reduction algorithm, your voice, or anything else you want to be the aural focus of the recording, will come through consistently.\nTake it out in extreme conditions and rest assured there won\u2019t be any sudden drop-offs in sound quality.\nThe Insta360 One X2 is a solid choice for anyone who wants to travel light but still have a feature-packed action camera in their pocket.\nInsta360 One RS (Most Versatile)\nThe Insta360 One RS is a modular 4K point-and-shoot action camera and a 5.7K 360-degree camera all rolled into one.\nAlthough many of the features of its predecessor, the Insta360 One R, remain the same, there have been some important upgrades.\nThe battery is larger and now gives you around 80 minutes of filming time. The 4K mod now has a 1/2 inch 48 megapixel sensor, that\u2019s 4 times as many megapixels as the Insta360 One R.\nThe device has also had a much-longed-for upgrade in terms of its ease of use. The Insta One R could be difficult to release from its mounting bracket, and once released, it could be fiddly to switch mods around.\nThe new quick-release mechanism makes it quick and simple to get the device out and then swap mods on the fly.\nInsta360 Go 2 (Hands-Free)\nThe Insta360 Go 2 is one of the smallest, if not the smallest, action cameras on the market today at just 53mm high and 24mm wide.\nIt comes in a case that is vital to its use. The case has the camera\u2019s menu for controlling the little fellow and also has little foldable legs that turn it into a tiny tripod.\nIt\u2019s also the charger, and if you use the charger with the camera you get 150 minutes of recording, compared to 60 minutes without.\nOn the backof the Insta360 Go 2 is a magnet, so you can stick it to a metal wall or a fridge, or to the magnetic pendant that comes with the camera, to fasten it to your chest for some creative first person shots.\nAs it\u2019s such a small device, with limited storage, it\u2019s maybe not the best option to take on your extreme sports adventure, but it\u2019s perfect for vlogging and travelling, and you could even stick it to your dog or cat, see what they get up to when you\u2019re not around.\nIt\u2019s also a big improvement on the original Insta360 Go, which didn\u2019t have the tripod case/charger and suffered from poor battery life.\nInsta360 Evo (Best for VR)\nThis a pretty unique device. It\u2019s a 360-degree camera that also doubles as a 180-degree 3D camera.\nIt shoots 18-megapixel photos and 5.7K video at 30fps, and 4K video at 30 or 50fps, so it\u2019s going to give you the high-quality imagery and footage that the other cameras in this list will.\nThe truly special thing about the camera, though, is how it enables you to make 3D, VR footage.\nThe device is basically a folded box. Folded up it\u2019s a 360 camera, and folded out flat, it\u2019s a 180-degree camera, with the lenses spaced out the width of your eyes.\nInsta360, with this device, found a way to make image stabilization, previously only possible with the 360-degree camera, available to the 180-degree camera. That\u2019s a game-changer for making VR videos.\nEliminating camera shake means that when you watch the footage back using a VR headset, you really feel like it\u2019s you who is doing whatever is happening in there.\nAnd you don\u2019t necessarily need an expensive VR headset to watch that footage. Get yourself a relatively inexpensive Holoframe (a special 3D viewing transparent phone cover), and watch that footage straight from your phone.\nWhat Is a 360\u00b0 Camera?\nA 360-degree camera is simply a camera which has front-facing and rear-facing 180-degree cameras.\nTogether, they capture everything all around, all at once.\n360-degree cameras are becoming extremely popular.\nThere\u2019s no better way to fully immerse a viewer in action than by giving them a 360-degree point of view.\nNot only that, with exponential increases in the power and capabilities of these cameras and their editing apps, the control users have over the framing and look of the final footage is pretty much endless.\n360-degree cameras have been used for a while in professional settings, such as in the cinema, commercial videography, and the tech industry, for example, Google\u2019s Street View.\nMore recently, as advances in technology have allowed the devices to shrink to the size of your average human\u2019s pocket, Joe Public has been able to get in on the action.\nHow Does an Insta360 Camera Work?\nWithout getting too technical, it\u2019s a stitch-up.\nThe two lenses, front and rear, record a full 180 degrees each, and when plopped together, like the two halves of an eggshell, they blend seamlessly to create an immersive, 360-degree image.\nIt\u2019s a kind of magic.\nBut it\u2019s not all about the camera. Insta360 is known for its in-app editing suite. This is where, using the dazzling variety of creative tools they give you, you can take your 360-degree video to the next level.\nWhat Is a 360\u00b0 Camera Used for?\nThese cameras are particularly good for video, and specifically, immersive experiences.\nFor extreme sports enthusiasts, one use is recording yourself skiing down a mountain, or climbing along a mountain ridge. Anyone who sees it will watch the experience from your POV.\nThey\u2019re also used in the real estate business for shooting interiors. An easy way for people to get a good look at the property.\nAnd Google Street View? Also made with 360-degree cameras.\nFrequently Asked Questions about Insta360 Cameras\nWhich Insta360 camera is the best?\nOf course, this depends on what you need it for.\nIf you specifically want to make 3D footage for VR, then the best one for you is the Evo.\nIf you\u2019d like something with interchangeable, modular parts, then you can go for the One RS or the 1-Inch 360 Edition.\nNot doing anything too extreme or for particularly long? Get the Go 2.\nFor everything else, the best thing to do would be to choose between the flagship X3, or the trust One X2.\nAre 360 degree cameras any good?\nThey do what they do, and they do it well.\nBut I suppose the question really is \u2018Are 360-degree cameras good for me?\u2019 And that, only you know.\nThey\u2019re best for shooting videos that immerse the viewer in the action or scene. They\u2019re less useful for stills photography as that is more focused on points of interest rather than capturing everything everywhere all at once.\nWhich is the latest Insta 360 camera?\nThe latest model is the Insta360 X3, released in September 2022.\nWhat is the most powerful Insta360 camera?\nThat\u2019d be the beefy Insta360 One RS. Beefy as in powerful, not chunky.\nThis bad boy is co-engineered with Leica and has interchangeable lenses and two one-inch CMOS sensors, which give you incredible dynamic range.\nWith it, you can capture 6K video footage and 21 megapixel still photographs.\nAlso, using AI, you can turn on the HDR capabilities of those massive sensors and bring out crazy details even in low-light conditions.\nLike I said: beefy.\nAre the Insta360 cameras better than GoPro?\nThey\u2019re different.\nGoPro is a household name, so when people think of action cameras they tend to think of GoPro. But Insta360 has carved out a strong niche for itself in the action camera market.\nBoth brands make very high-quality products with a range of specifications to suit pretty much every kind of user.\nGoPro does have its own 360-degree offering, the GoPro Max, but Insta360 specialise in 360-degree cameras across the range.\nSo I guess it\u2019s not about which is better, more about which brand better suits your needs. And if you\u2019re looking specifically for a 360-degree camera, it\u2019s probably a good idea to go with the company that specialises in them.\nFinal Words\nSo there you have it. I hope after reading this article you can see that Insta360 have a pretty comprehensive range of action cameras for you to choose from.\nThere\u2019s something for everyone. From consumers who want something small, light and for simple uses, to those who want to make cinema quality, immersive footage, or video specifically for VR headsets.\nInsta360 have managed to corner this growing part of the market with devices that offer great image and audio quality, and at different price points that make the cameras available to anyone.\nAnd 360-degree cameras aren\u2019t all about the tiny planet effect anymore (although that\u2019s still fun). Insta360 doesn\u2019t only give you the camera, but also the powerful editing suite that will make your 360-degree experience second to none.\nDoes everything you could want from a 360 camera in a compact body with great battery life.\nYou'll Also Like These:\nJeff Collier is an experienced film photographer who enjoys experimenting with modern digital photography equipment, software and apps.

Co-engineered with Leica, the Ace Pro Action Camera can shoot 8K footage and record audio in 48 kHz 16-bit AAC. It can also record slow motion in 4k, utilize Active HDR, and use its new PureVideo mode for fantastic low-light shooting. It comes packed with \"best-in-class\" AI that can provide real-time image processing.\nInsta360 was proud to show off the Ace Pro Action Camera's large, 2.4-inch flip screen, which can make shooting in \"blog mode\" a breeze. The camera also comes with a \"suite of features that have never been built into an action camera before,\" including hand-gesture controls to operate the camera at a distance.\nThe manufacturer went to great lengths to take the hassle out of video editing for its action camera users with a simple setup and interface, as well as an AI highlights assistant. It also includes a one-touch button that pauses recording \u2014 rather than stops it \u2014 so you can resume recording footage into the same clip. Insta360's presenter gave the example of pausing video at a stoplight, editing out the boring footage straight at the source rather than later. This can make editing far less cumbersome by reducing the amount of clips recorded during any given session.\nThe Ace Pro Action Camera is also rugged, durably built, and able to shoot underwater footage. Insta360 pointed out during the tour that it's the only action camera company that offers a free lens repair program, as well. The Insta360 Ace Pro\u00a0is available for $450 on Amazon."

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Demystifying Log Formats: What Every Aspiring Colorist Needs to Know\nOne of the most exciting consequences of the advancement of technology is the democratization of tools that were once reserved for big-budget productions.\nOf course, this applies to the cameras we use, as well. Action cameras, like those from GoPro and Insta360, allow for shots that were never possible before, in conditions that would bring any camera of yesteryear to its knees in a heartbeat. And who would have thought that just about every one of us would be carrying around a tiny device that can shoot video good enough that the manufacturer substituted them for high-end cinema cameras during a launch event for some of their other products?\nOn that topic specifically, one of the headline features of the iPhone 15 Pro Max is, of course, its camera. Many of the specifications are those we\u2019ve come to expect from a modern iPhone \u2013 4K HDR video, excellent image stabilization, the list goes on. But one feature stands out among the others, that being its ability to record video with a log curve applied, a first in the smartphone world.\nIf you\u2019re new to the video world, this is a feature you may well never have heard of before. In a nutshell, a \u201clog curve\u201d, short for \u201clogarithmic curve,\u201d is a special way of encoding the data captured by the sensor in order to preserve as much dynamic range (the difference in brightness between the darkest and brightest parts of an image) as possible.\nClipping and Dynamic Range\nTo fully appreciate what makes a log curve so important, it\u2019s vital to understand what a log curve is trying to prevent in the first place \u2013 clipping.\nClipping is what happens when something, whether that\u2019s a camera, a monitor, or even a piece of software, is asked to handle or display an image with color or brightness values outside its limits. In camera terms, each individual pixel on the sensor can only report so much light hitting it before it saturates and reports its maximum value (often called \u201cblowing out\u201d), or so little light hitting it that it\u2019s below its detection threshold and thus reports no signal (called \u201ccrushing\u201d). Critically, any contrast or color that may have existed in clipped areas is gone and not recoverable, because pulling down white and lifting black just gets you closer to middle gray.\nDynamic range is a measure of how much information can be stored in a photo or video without clipping, specifically the difference in how dark the darkest areas are and how bright the brightest areas are. It is a crucial component to the perceived quality of an image and is a specification that many camera manufacturers tout as an indicator of a professional-grade system, usually measured in how many stops of light it would take to get from one end of the scale to the other. For example, the Arri Alexa 35, considered by many to be the current gold standard of cinema cameras and the yardstick by which all others are judged, sports a whopping 17 stops of dynamic range. This means that a director or cinematographer can pull off some incredible shots, like the one below.\nThis image, taken from Alexa footage, already looks great. However, we can see that the brightest areas and darkest areas have both lost detail due to clipping. An SDR (standard dynamic range) monitor can only display around 8 stops of dynamic range, which means that any luminance information outside those bounds has to effectively be discarded and shown as either pure black or pure white.\nHowever, that does not mean that the source file itself is subject to the same limits.\nThanks to the extremely wide dynamic range of the Alexa 35, a colorist has a great deal of wiggle room when it comes to pushing and pulling the image. This still has been graded to give more detail in the darker areas, which we can see in the additional detail evident inside the diver\u2019s mask and on his outfit. Of course, the compromise made is that the bright lights on the front of his helmet clip and lose detail, since we are still bound by that 8-stop range of an SDR monitor.\nIn this still, the colorist has chosen to go the other way and give more attention to preserving the brightest areas. Now, the rest of the image looks very dark indeed, but as we can see, even the brightest parts of the lights have had their actual orange color preserved rather than clipping to white.\nIf we were all viewing this on a display with a higher dynamic range, and the still was graded to take that into account, we would be able to have the best of both worlds, with good detail in both the shadows and highlights.\nLog Curves and LUTs\nSo what does any of that have to do with a log curve?\nWell, as previously mentioned, a log curve is a special way of mapping the brightness of an image so that you can capture more detail in the brightest and darkest parts of an image.\nWhile the above graph may not mean anything to you at first glance, it is a mathematical representation of the way the Arri LogC profile encodes information from the camera sensor. According to this graph, we can see that when using a log curve, the camera is effectively reducing contrast at the very bottom of the \u201csignal\u201d (or brightness) range, and is doing the same at the very top.\nWe would then expect to see an image that looks very gray and washed out, which is in fact exactly what we see when viewing a log image straight out of the camera. Unfortunately, I do not have access to an Alexa 35 to play around with, since they command prices greater than anyone except the highest-end productions can stomach, but what I do have is a Nikon Z9 with the ability to capture N-log. While the name and exact specification may be slightly different between the manufacturers, the mechanism is very much the same, so we can still get a good illustration of what we\u2019re dealing with.\nAnyway, as we can see above, there\u2019s still a good amount of contrast in the middle tones of the image, but the sky and shadows are substantially less defined, going gray very quickly.\nThankfully, because a log curve is simply complicated math at its core, all we have to do to get back to a normal-looking image is tell our editing software to apply a lookup table, or a \u201cLUT\u201d, which effectively reverses that math for us. Every manufacturer should have an official LUT for whichever flavor of log video their cameras use. Canon has a couple of different variants of C-Log, same for Sony and S-Log, same for Fujifilm and F-log. Even the new GoPro Hero 12 Black can shoot in GP-Log, which is awesome for use on a drone or in mixed lighting like I often encounter.\nMuch better. The only thing I really don\u2019t like about this image is that the clouds in the background look a little blown out to me after using the LUT by itself. Because I recorded in N-Log, though, the detail is still there, and I can use the excellent HDR grading tools in DaVinci Resolve to bring them down without affecting the rest of the image too much.\nAs you can see, we\u2019ve tamed the harshness of the clouds and brought out a bit more detail, just by tweaking a slider. This is an image I would be perfectly happy with.\nCommon Pitfalls\nNow, let\u2019s talk about working with log footage.\nOne of the most common mistakes colorists make when first encountering log footage is to treat it in exactly the same manner as they would footage recorded in a \u201cflat\u201d or \u201cneutral\u201d color profile. Many cameras offer this feature to give a more forgiving baseline for doing additional color work in post. While it may look similar to this kind of footage, with low contrast and saturation, it is vastly different.\nThe vast majority of the color tools available in a suite like DaVinci Resolve or Adobe Premiere are designed to work primarily with linear video data, not logarithmic video data. Cranking your contrast and saturation and calling it a day might get you closer to normal-looking footage, but importantly, the contrast roll-off in the highlights and shadows inherent to log footage will still be there, and will only get more extreme the harder you try to get rid of it with linear tools.\nWhen shooting with log footage, it\u2019s very important to get your exposure right. Some versions of log footage look best when exposed slightly over or under where linear footage would be. These are oftentimes not explicit recommendations by the manufacturer and are instead crowdsourced insights gathered by the community of people around a specific camera. Visit the official forums, Reddit, or YouTube to see if such a specification exists for your camera.\nIf you\u2019re working with log footage, you\u2019re also probably working at a high enough level that you should be keeping on top of your color management. For people shooting vlogs on a single camera or a phone and just cutting it down to post on social media, this isn\u2019t much of a concern because much of that data is baked in and will not meaningfully change \u2013 you\u2019re very likely to be viewing \u201cbasic\u201d footage on a phone or a similar device, and that will already have been taken into account for you.\nHowever, high-end cameras designed for more advanced video will often need a bit of help translating their images into footage that will look good on any given screen, with the correct gamma and color space. DaVinci Resolve is famous for its color management workflow, and realistically this is a topic deserving of its own article, but suffice it to say that you should be double-checking that your footage is being correctly translated into the output settings you need. Rec. 709/Gamma 2.4 is very common, but do your research on which specs are best for a given use case.\nClosing Thoughts\nLog footage being available in devices like an iPhone or a GoPro is just another example of the idea that we as creators are living in a golden age of creativity and self-expression, in which the tools of professionals can now literally fit in the palm of our hand. Of course, with that great power comes a great responsibility to know how best to use them in order to do both your tools and yourself the justice they deserve. As with all things, the best way to familiarize yourself with your limits is to test them, to explore what you can create. I\u2019ve shot plenty of footage that I would pretty unequivocally call \u201cbad\u201d, but trial-and-error is key. I just hope I\u2019ve helped to maximize the trial and minimize the error.\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc. All rights reserved."

The one missing piece in its line-up was a GoPro-style action cam \u2013 and that\u2019s now been rectified by the arrival of the Insta360 Ace Pro.\nThe Ace Pro may share the familiar blocky rectangle shape of GoPro\u2019s long-running Hero series (and costs a similar amount to the current Hero 12 Black model) but has some cards to play in an effort to forge its own unique appeal: Leica co-branding, the ability to capture 8K footage and a nifty-looking flip-up touchscreen. Is that enough to muscle in on GoPro\u2019s market share?\nHow we test cameras\nEvery camera reviewed on Stuff is tested in a range of lighting conditions, with a variety of subjects and scenes. We use our years of experience to compare with rivals and assess ergonomics, features and general usability. Manufacturers have no visibility on reviews before they appear online, and we never accept payment to feature products.\nFind out more about how we test and rate products.\nDesign & screens: full tilt\nIf you\u2019ve used a GoPro, the Ace Pro feels very similar, from its rugged boxy body (waterproof to 10m, just like the Hero 12 Black) to its offset wide-angle lens and large power and record buttons (located on the side and top respectively). I certainly had no issues getting to grips with it, inserting the microSD card and battery and fully charging the latter via the USB-C port.\nWhere it differs most dramatically is its touchscreen: Insta360 has fitted the Ace Pro with a large 2.4in rear display that\u2019s mounted on a hinge, allowing it to tilt upwards up to 180\u00ba. That means it can face fully forward, of course, making it perfect for shooting vlogs and selfies, but also that it can be tilted slightly to aid with tricky angles \u2013 such as if it\u2019s mounted on your bike\u2019s handlebars. I found it an extremely useful feature, although I suspect it does increase the camera\u2019s likelihood of getting damaged in the event of it being dropped or involved in some type of collision \u2013 a frequent occupational hazard for an action cam.\nThere\u2019s a handy small secondary display on the front too, displaying current settings and shooting data so you can quickly check you\u2019re using the right frame rate and resolution before you hit the record button.\nIn terms of mounting options, the Ace Pro is compatible with the same \u2018mounting fingers\u2019 universal system as used by GoPros, which allows it to be fixed to all manner of things. It doesn\u2019t have the fingers built-in, however: instead a magnet-assisted adapter clips to the bottom. The idea, I suppose, is that it\u2019s faster to mount and dismount than a GoPro, and that\u2019s true \u2013 but however I did find the clip a little fussy, requiring some checking and pushing to make sure it had actually clicked securely into place. Users will need to take care when using this \u2013 an unsecure mount could see the camera falling off its perch and getting damaged or lost.\nInterface & performance: swipy and stable\nThe Ace Pro uses a touch-based interface: you tap on-screen icons to bring up various menus and tooltips, and swipe from the \u2018home\u2019 screen left, right, up and down to access recorded content and settings. I found it simple and quite intuitive once I\u2019d played around with it a bit, and for those who don\u2019t want to prod and poke the screen, the camera includes a range of voice and gesture controls too.\nYou can also control the camera wirelessly through the Insta360 mobile app, which is a very solid effort all round, including good editing features, background downloading of clips and options for sharing content easily or uploading to social media.\nThere\u2019s a fun feature in the form of the AI Highlights Assistant, which analyses whichever videos you select (although it doesn\u2019t work with videos created using the PureVideo mode) and builds a highlight reel out of them. You can manually edit parts of the reel if you like too. It\u2019s not going to appeal to everyone, but I think it\u2019s great for rapidly creating clips to share with friends and family.\nAny action cam worth its salt needs decent image stabilisation, and I found the Ace Pro\u2019s FlowState to be more than sufficient. Available in three \u2018strengths\u2019 plus a Horizon Lock mode (which works to 45\u00ba during regular video capture and 360\u00ba in the FreeFrame video mode), it offers a welcome range of options that allow the user to achieve the best balance between stabilisation and image cropping.\nIn terms of battery life, I think the Ace Pro just pips the GoPro Hero 12 Black. I left it recording at 4K/30fps to see how long the 1650mAh battery would last, but the 64GB microSD card actually filled up first. That was after 75 minutes, and there was still a good chunk of power left. The battery is fast charging too, going from 0 to 80% in 22 minutes and 0 to 100% in 46 minutes.\nPhoto and video quality: Dancing in the dark\nI\u2019ll start with the bad news: the Ace Pro\u2019s 8K/24fps capture mode hasn\u2019t been available in the camera\u2019s pre-release firmware, so I\u2019ve not been able to test out a feature that could give it the edge over the GoPro in terms of detail. Insta360\u2019s PR team promise it\u2019ll be in the launch firmware, however.\nThat\u2019s a shame, but even so I\u2019ve been impressed with the camera\u2019s video performance \u2013 particularly in low light. I took the Ace Pro out walking on a couple of very dark November nights to test its PureShot video mode, which restricts the frame rate to 30fps but allows 4K capture with image stabilisation, then sprinkles on some AI fairy dust to bring more detail out of the shadows. Action cams have always struggled at night due to their small image sensors, but the DJI Osmo Action 4 did a decent job and the Ace Pro, I think, goes slightly further. Both these cameras use a 1/1.3in sensor, but the Ace Pro\u2019s footage has a bit more crispness to it. It\u2019s still not the sort of pristine footage that\u2019ll get pixel peepers rejoicing the streets, mind you: I noticed some strange artefacts caused by movement and it\u2019s much softer than daytime footage. But it\u2019s a good effort, and I think the best I\u2019ve seen from a standard action camera to date.\nRegular video capture offers quality up to 4K/120fps, with automatic HDR if the frame rate is kept at 30fps or below. The footage is sharp with a good balance of colours, but I couldn\u2019t call it better than anything I\u2019ve seen from the Hero 12 Black or DJI Osmo Action 4. The Ace Pro doesn\u2019t offer a 10-bit option for those seeking better colour detail and dynamic range through post-production grading (a missed opportunity, given the Osmo Action 4 and Hero 12 Black do) but there is at least a \u2018flat\u2019 colour profile for anyone who prefers to do so.\nSound, meanwhile, is pretty standard. The built-in mics capture stereo AAC audio that suffers quite badly in the wind but serves its purpose well enough; users looking for something special should invest in an external mic setup of some kind.\nI don\u2019t think anybody is going to be let down by the footage they get out of the Ace Pro \u2013 unless they were expecting it do blow its competitors out of the water, of course. In practice, its video quality is exactly what you\u2019d expect from a flagship action cam. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the 8K mode turns it into something special.\nPhotos, meanwhile, are also par for the course. The Quad Bayer sensor offers a choice between 48MP and 12MP (although HDR shots only get the latter) and with the dewarp setting turned the resulting wide-angle images can look quite nice \u2013 even dramatic and striking with some clever composition. If you\u2019ve got a decent smartphone in your pocket, though, it\u2019ll probably do a better job for still images than any action cam.\nInsta360 Ace Pro verdict\nWhile the Insta360 Ace Pro may not give its closest rivals the image quality pasting its makers might claim, I\u2019m left in little doubt as to its all-round quality. GoPro won\u2019t be losing much sleep over its arrival on the scene, with the Hero 12 Black still offering the best daytime image quality of any action cam, but the Ace Pro\u2019s strong points such as its flip screen and low light video performance do help differentiate it from the competition \u2013 and I can\u2019t say it really lets itself down in any other important areas either.\nOverall, the Ace Pro represents another thoroughly dependable addition to the range of action cameras on the market, and provides a solid platform for Insta360 to build on with future iterations.\nStuff Says\u2026\nScore: 4/5\nGreat low light performance and a flexible flip screen help set this action cam aside from its peers\nPros\nImpressive low light video\nIntuitive UI and companion app\nVersatile tilting touchscreen\nCons\nNo 10-bit video\nMounting clip requires some care\nInsta360 Ace Pro technical specifications\nTech journalism's answer to\u00a0The Littlest Hobo, I've\u00a0written for a host of titles and lived in three different countries in my 15 years-plus as a freelancer.

Find out more about how we test.\n01. Ricoh Theta Z1\nRicoh\u2019s Theta Z1 is its flagship 360 model. It's able to record spherically in 4K UHD30 and captures 360 stills at 23MP. The back-illuminated 1-inch CMOS sensor produces minimal noise in low light conditions outside or in \u2013 perfect for virtual tours. The newly developed lens unit improves optical clarity, and with an aperture range from f/2.1-5.6, it's designed to reduce flare, chromatic aberration, and ghosting as well as lengthening the depth of field.\nThe Theta Z1 captures images in raw (DNG) and JPEG format for flexible post-production and utilises a four-channel microphone for realistic sound recording. Able to record both video and stills, the Theta Z1 also works as a 4K live streaming device.\n02. Matterport Pro2 3D\nA staple in the real estate photographer\u2019s arsenal, the Matterport Pro2 3D works by recording 360 imagery of a space thanks to its in-built motorised mount, and then delivers a full resolution virtual tour straight to your smart device. Follow the simple setup instructions to capture indoor spaces and automatically attain a floor plan and 3D model to navigate through. After the space is processed you can even go into the model and label objects or measure them \u2013 ideal for renovations and online marketing.\nIt outputs at 134MP, has GPS, and can scan for up to 8 hours in a single charge with a 4.5 hour charge time, making it useful for photographing multiple properties in one day. It\u2019s a little bigger and heavier than others in this list, and it may take a little longer to photograph (up to 30mins for a 100sq/m space) but that\u2019s due to the 3D scanning and modelling tech.\n03. Insta360 Pro 2\nChappie robot looks aside, the Insta360 Pro2 is a professional 360 camera with incredible specifications and performance designed for full-time videographers who need 360 photos and videos with the option of recording in 3D. It can record 8K video at 30FPS in 3D (that\u2019s twice the amount of data to process) and can jump up to 60FPS in 2D mode, or 120FPS in 4K 2D.\nDynamic range issues are combated with in-camera High Dynamic Range (HDR) recording to save highlights and shadows from clipping. In-built stabilisation comes in the form of the FlowState technology and a 9-axis gyro to provide gimbal-quality steady footage for use with Virtual Reality headsets. It does all of this in a compact body and links with Farsight live monitoring for real-time viewing.\n04. Kandao QooCam 8K 360\nA whopping 8K video resolution is a massive feat in a consumer 360 camera of this size. Capable of dropping down to 4K, it can record at 120FPS for ultra slow-mo footage. Its 6-axis gyro paired with the IMU sensor and in-built tech means footage is stabilised in-camera for smooth recording. Self-shooting from a monopod or selfie-stick is easy too as the camera automatically removes the stick for cleaner results. This 8K 360 camera can slip into a jacket pocket easily, making it ultra portable for use on the road.\n05. GoPro Max\nGoPro is known for building action cameras that can withstand a hell of a beating and the GoPro Max is no exception. Natively waterproof to 33ft, shock resistant and tiny, it\u2019s ideal for mounting on motorcycles, cars and other vehicles alike. GoPro bills the Max as three cameras in one. That\u2019s because it can capture 6K video in either 360 or standard format when flipped over to HERO mode, and the Max can be used as a 1080p live streaming camera for easy vlogging.\nShoot ultra smooth 360 timelapses using Max TimeWarp, record 270-degree panoramic shots with PowerPano and use up to 12 voice commands to control the device for hands-free operation.\n06. Vuze 3D 360 4K VR\nVirtual Reality (VR) is all about capturing true-to-life footage in as much detail as possible. That\u2019s why the Vuze 3D 360 4K VR is perfect for VR use. The camera has eight Full HD lenses combined in pairs to capture 360 degree 3D video footage for more realistic VR output. At just 450g the camera is pocket-sized and can slip straight into a camera bag without any problem. A neat fold-away tripod also doubles as a selfie stick and the camera comes in four vibrant colourways\nIn 3D 360 it records video at 4K30 but in 2D 360 this jumps up to 4K60. Easy to use, it requires the press of just a single button and can be edited together on a smart device or laptop before publishing.\n07. Insta360 ONE R Twin Edition\nThrowing a punch at GoPro, the Insta360 One R Twin Edition takes things up a notch with not one but two lens options: a 360-degree dual-lens module and a single 4K wide-angle which are easily slipped in and out of the camera for ultimate modular performance. The screen can also be rotated for use in either direction.\nA big 1-inch image sensor makes it usable in low light conditions and comes equipped with FlowState image stabilisation, auto framing, hyperlapse mode, and 8x slow motion. It can also be operated via voice control and shoots 5.7K video resolution.\nRead more:\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\nGet the Creative Bloq Newsletter\nDaily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors.\nJason Parnell-Brookes is an Internationally award-winning photographer, educator and writer.

        "raw_content": "Samir's Virtual World\nInsta360 X4 in 2024: Rumor or reality?\nGuess what? There\u2019s chatter about a new Insta360 X4 camera.\nWe\u2019ll try to predict its release date and possible features, like improved resolution or sensor quality. Also, we\u2019ll compare it with the current Insta360 X3.\nThe big question: buy now or wait for the X4? Let\u2019s dive in!\nWhen will it come out\nThe question on everyone\u2019s lips is: \u201cWhen will the Insta360 X4 be released?\u201d Given their history of releases, we can expect to see this gem hit the market in late 2024.\nYou might ask why I\u2019m making this prediction. Well, if you look at Insta360\u2019s track record with previous models \u2013 One X in 2018, X2 in 2023 and most recently X3 in 2023 \u2013 they\u2019ve consistently unveiled a new model every two years.\nThis pattern gives us strong reason to believe that fall of 2024 could be when we get our hands on the next generation action camera from Insta360. But remember. This isn\u2019t set in stone; it\u2019s just an educated guess based on past release cycles.\nSpecifications of Insta360 X4\nIn terms of specifications for the upcoming model? We\u2019ll need to wait for official word from Insta360. However, I\u2019m feeling bold today so let me make some predictions about what features could make their way into the x4.\n6K Resolution\nIt\u2019s predicted that the X4 will sport a 6K resolution. This step up from the X3\u2019s 5.7K could mean a little more detail in your shots.\nIn practical terms, this would let you capture crispier images while retaining better quality when zooming into details or reframing footage post-shoot.\nSensor Size & Quality\nThe sensor size for the new model is likely going to be similar to that of its predecessor \u2013 small enough for an action cam but significantly improved in quality.\nThis improvement means better low-light performance and dynamic range which can be essential during travel shoots where lighting conditions change rapidly.\nBetter Processor\nWe anticipate that Insta360 might equip their upcoming model with a stronger processor compared to what we\u2019ve seen in previous models.\nA powerful processor helps improve shot speed and overall image quality by processing data faster \u2013 so less waiting around after hitting \u2018record\u2019.\nA stronger processor could facilitate more effective encoding & decoding of video, thus enabling higher quality visuals at lower bitrates.\nInsta360 x4 vs X3\nIt\u2019s always a challenge deciding whether to snag the current tech or hold out for the next big thing.\nThat\u2019s why we\u2019re comparing two of Insta360\u2019s titans \u2013 x3 and its future successor, the x4. If you\u2019re thinking about diving into 360 video capture with these action cams, this is just what you need.\nSee reviews and price for Insta360 X3\nThe Present: The Insta360 x3\nIn terms of resolution, both photos and videos on the x3 model are truly impressive. Its photo resolution peaks at 18MP while it records video in stunning 5K (5472*2736).\nAll that packed in a compact body designed to accompany you anywhere your adventure takes you.\nBeyond resolution though lies bitrate and frame rate \u2013 critical factors when capturing motion scenes. With a max bitrate of up to 120Mbps, fast-moving footage stays crisp even during quick pans or high-speed actions like biking downhill or paragliding over landscapes.\nFurthermore, sensor size plays an essential role too; bigger isn\u2019t always better when balancing portability and image quality.\nWhile there hasn\u2019t been official information released regarding its exact measurements yet, one can speculate based on previous models that it will likely be similar to maintain consistency in form factor across their line-up.\nThe Future: Speculations About The Insta360 X4\nNote: This section involves speculation as no official specs have been confirmed by Instat340 as of writing this post.\nI\u2019m betting my chips on some major improvements with the upcoming release considering how each successive model has raised the bar. The x4 could potentially boast a resolution of up to 6K, outperforming its predecessor in both photo and video quality.\nThe sensor size might stay consistent with the previous model, but it\u2019s likely that Insta360 will use a more advanced version for better low-light performance and dynamic range.\nA higher-grade processor may also be in the works to improve shot speed and overall image quality while improving bitrate above current standards.\nBuy Now or Wait?\nConsider if you\u2019re after reliable and cheaper tech today and want it now or are you willing to hold off for potential upgrades and have no 360 cam in the meantime.\nConsider Your Immediate Needs\nIf you don\u2019t have a 360 camera at all now and looking to get one, I would say get the X2 or X3 now to get into 360 action cam arena, and then upgrade later if you like it.\nWho knows when the X4 will come out for sure?\nYour Budget Matters Too.\nAn important factor often overlooked during these tech decisions: budget.\nRemember that newer models tend to cost more at launch before prices start dropping after some time post-release. So if budget constraints are looming large, grabbing an x3, which may see a price drop after x4\u2019s release, could be the way to go.\nIn fact the Insta360 X2 has had some massive price drops recently, if you are interested in getting a 360 cam now while waiting for the X4 to come out.\nThe Value of Time\nFinally, let\u2019s consider the worth of time. How much do you value the ability to start recording 360-degree videos right away?\nKey Thought:\nIf you need a 360 action cam right now, go for the Insta360 x3 \u2013 it won\u2019t disappoint. Or even consider the X2 if you are on a budget. No guarantee about when X4 will come out if you are really interested in 360 cams right now, and of course the newer cam will come at a premium price.\nRelated Articles\nIf you are interested in 360 cameras then check out my related sites and videos.\nMy Youtube channel with reframed as well as full 360 videos while travellingSamir\u2019s Virtual World \u2013 YouTube\nThe Insta360 X2 vs X3 360 camera comparisonComparing the 360 action cams: Gopro Max vs Insta360 X3Best selfie sticks for 360 camsList of affordable 360 cameras\nI travel the world and film with my 360 camera and write about my experiences and provide suggestions for readers.\nMy Virtual World includes 360 VR travel and well as the gear needed to shoot and watch them, including 360 cameras and VR headsets.\nTop Posts\nFollow us on social\nContact us\nPrivacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Samir's Virtual World - WordPress Theme by Kadence WP"

Both versions are available now.\nThe standard Ace camera model comes with a smaller 1/2-inch image sensor, but it supports recording up to 6K at 30 frames per second, and both models can shoot 4K at a high-speed 120 frames per second and take 48MP pictures. They also have new five-nanometer AI chips inside that activate features like PureVideo, which can augment greater low-light performance by denoising footage in real time. Only the Pro, however, is capable of capturing additional nighttime detail and supports Active HDR for daytime recordings.\nThe flippy screen viewing option of the Insta360 Aces cameras, also seen on the company\u2019s recent Go 3 camera Action Pod body, could add some durability risk, but it helps with better framing and is easier to see than the small front screens on GoPros. When recording yourself, the camera can react to hand gestures to start recording at a distance so you can get in your TikTok dance performances.\nInsta360 added a bunch of features that can save you SD card space, like the ability to pause a video recording without breaking the clip and the ability to cancel an active recording by holding the shutter button, eliminating the need to deal with junk-take video files. The Ace cameras can also switch up clip aspect ratios after recording, so you can go from landscape to portrait for social videos or use a full square for more framing flexibility.\nThe AI highlights assistant feature can save you time by quickly finding and clipping out action shots from large video recordings so you don\u2019t have to transfer the whole file. Once the footage is on your smartphone, you can have fun editing it or allow it to make generated memories. It also has an AI Warp feature that can change up your clips by entering custom and preset prompts to generate different effects. Insta360 will release more of these features \u201cheading into 2024.\u201d\nOne of the cool sleeper features of the Ace cameras is connectivity with Apple Watches and Garmin devices that can bring GPS and other data into your recordings. It can overlay things like elevation and speed on your video, and you can frame up your shot from your wrist and control the cameras on your next snowy mountain descent.\nThe cameras feature a waterproof design with the ability to submerge up to 33 feet underwater and up to 196 feet with a Dive Case accessory. Their batteries are internally tested to last 100 minutes while recording in 4K30 with Active HDR. The cameras can fast-charge to 80 percent in 22 minutes via a power delivery charger.\nInsta360 is best known for its true 360 cameras like the X3 and the One RS. Its most GoPro-like camera before the Ace is the One R, which could shape-shift into a blocky action cam. With the new Ace cameras, Insta360 is breaking out of its recent comfort zone of making interesting modular cameras and instead building simpler ones that more people are likely to use.\nThe Insta360 Ace ($379.99) and Ace Pro ($449.99) are available now worldwide and can be purchased on Insta360.com and Amazon.\nNetflix is turning into cable TV\nNetflix is going to take away its cheapest ad-free plan\nFord\u2019s new 48-inch digital dashboard is a lot of Android for one car\niOS 17.3 is out, adding Stolen Device Protection for your iPhone\nOnePlus 12 review: refreshingly basic\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from Cameras and Photography\nThe World Press Photo Contest\u2019s updated AI rules help define what a modern photograph is\nDo Pixel 8 AI-edited photos have to be labeled as synthetic content on YouTube?

        "raw_content": "Insta360 X3 action cam uses new 48MP sensors, larger touchscreen & better performance\nInsta360 has announced a new 360-degree action camera, the Insta360 X3. The X3 features new 48MP image sensors and a 2.29\" touchscreen. Insta360 says it's 'the most powerful camera you can carry in your pocket.'\n'With the X series, we are reinventing the point-and-shoot camera to make it easier for anyone to be a creator. X3 is built to help the next generation of creators take their creativity to new heights,' said JK Liu, founder of Insta360.\nThanks to the high-res image sensors, the camera records 5.7K 360-degree video with Active HDR and an Invisible Selfie Stick effect. As for still images, the camera captures 72MP and 18MP photos using its 6.7mm (35mm equivalent) F1.9 lens.\nYou can capture 360-degree or standard single-lens content. Using the 360-degree feature, users can record 5.7K footage at 24/25/30 fps. You can also record 4K video at up to 60 fps. In the single lens mode, the resolution tops out at 4K (24/25/30 fps), although 3.6K, 2.7K and 1080p resolutions can be shot at up to 60 fps. Video modes include standard, Active HDR, Timelapse, TimeShift, Bullet Time and Loop Recording. Active HDR is possible thanks to the new 48MP image sensors and uses an algorithm to stabilize action footage and minimize ghosting while expanding the visible dynamic range of your footage. 360 Timelapse is available at up to 8K resolution. As for Bullet Time, it's a Matrix-like effect made possible by swinging the camera over your head in a circle. In this special mode, you can shoot at 4K/120p and 3K/180p.\nThe X3 incorporates a six-axis gyroscope and utilizes Insta360's FlowState stabilization to keep your video stable. There's a 360-degree Horizon Lock that keeps the horizon level even when you completely rotate the camera.\nLike any good action camera, the X3 is rugged and durable. The camera is waterproof down to 10m (33') out of the box. You can also add optional accessories to increase its durability, including lens guards for users who enjoy action sports.\nWith the new Loop Recording mode, you can also use the Insta360 X3 as a dashcam. It continuously records video in this mode but only saves a set duration of recent recordings based on your selected settings so that you won't fill up your storage with useless footage. Speaking of storage, the camera saves to a microSD card.\nAdditional workflow features include BLE 5.0 Bluetooth, WiFi, a USB Type-C port for charging, and 48 kHz audio recording via stereo mics. The camera weighs 180g (6.35 oz.), and its dimensions (W x H x D) are 114 x 46 x 33.1 mm (4.5 x 1.8 x 1.3\"). The new 2.29\" touchscreen is covered with tempered glass and the camera includes four directional buttons so you can use the camera even while wearing gloves. The X3 includes a new, larger 1800mAh battery that can record 81 minutes of 5.7K/30p video. The camera's shutter speed range is 120s to 1/8000s and it includes +/- 4 EV of exposure compensation. The ISO range is 100-3200.\nThe Insta360 X3 is compatible with iOS and Android mobile devices. The mobile app includes AI technology to automatically select your best footage and apply edits. You can compile highlight videos and apply more than 30 special effects to your content. There's also a desktop version for improved controls and editing performance.\nInsta360 X3 is available to order now via Insta360 and Amazon. The camera is $449.99. Additional accessories like the lens guards, a cold shoe, mic adapter and Quick Reader are also available now. For more information, visit Insta360.\nComments\nAfter sorting out some initial issues I managed to do a quick test about the AEB capabilities of this X3 camera.I regret to inform you that it is crippled. The AEB is done thru the HDR mode.The user doesn't have control of ISO, apparently it is fixed to ISO289 :(ISO289 is too high to capture light sources and highlights !User can pick the number of exposures (up to 9) and the EV increments between shots but even for 9 shots it is capped to 1EV gaps, or 2EV for 5 exposures, so never to exceeds 4EV plus and minus, 8EV in total.On top of that, in HDR mode, the resolution is limited to 18MP and it can not be saved in Raw format. :(\nI received the X3 today, it took more than a week to arrive since these are being shipped from China. They won't tell you!I bought it through the Insta360 store. Taxes were included but Ilater the bank charged me after the fact a $13 foreign transaction fee !Unfortunately, there has been issues after issues.Currently I'm stuck in a loop.It won't let me use it, unless I register the device with them through the App.But I can't get to use the App until I upgrade the firmware.But I can't get to upgrade the firmware since it is failing when reaching 10%.And tech support is not online now. GrrrrThis sucks !!\nI just hate bringing any kind of \"stick\" when I travel, which is almost mandatory for 360 cameras. With any other camera including the gopro you can just shoot handheld no problem.\n'I just hate bringing any kind of \"stick\" when I travel, which is almost mandatory for 360 cameras. With any other camera including the gopro you can just shoot handheld no problem.'\nIf you use the X3 in 4K single-lens mode (i.e. like a GoPro) they you could use it for handheld photos/video... although I agree that to get the full use of a 360 camera like the X3... a stick is important\nWhy don't you like the stick for travel? Airline regulations/bulk? The latest shorter Insta360 stick is quite \"handy\" at 8.25 inches/22cm while extending to 27\"/120cm. I find the stick makes it a lot easier dig the camera out my bag/backpack.\nJust a little correction here 120cm is not 27\" it's 46\".\nGoPro.....why don't you learn?\nThe limitations of these dual sensor 360 cams is the lens, probably unlikely to get good IQ from small 180 deg lenses regardless of resolution . They could do quad sensors with narrower FOV but that would probably drive costs up.\nCircular Fish Eye lenses are generally made to project an image circle within the sensor, so you end up with a crop\nof the total pixels to begin with.The quality is not there yet, but is good enough for certain use cases. The quality is far from what a regular cameras do, but the functionality of these 360 cameras make up for it in spades.Insta360 sells hogher quality cams with\nwith 6 lenses like the $5,000 Pro2.\nA few companies did this with semi-reasonably priced devices (TECHE, Labpano Pilot One, what was the name of that company that lasted maybe a year and was a spinoff of Ricoh or something?) where they had four sensors and instead of the circle being fit to the \"narrow\" dimension of a non-square sensor, it was fit to the \"long\" dimension.\nUnfortunately every single one of those units had a massive flaw:\nThey only shot JPEG!\nJust bought one online in the hopes it has AEB for photos.It is already #1 in Amazon in their category and B&H doesn't have them in-stock currently.Will clarify here since I couldn't find the AEB feature in any of the reviews nor the official documentation.\nOlder X2 has AEB, so I assume X3 has it too. You'll need a bit complicated workflow to stitch all the bracketed images together, especially dng's, and combine them in equirectangular 2:1\nThe process of combining AEB shots has been streamlined for years now.Photoshop has had this function where you can generate a HDRI 32 image in seconds.The emergence of these 360 cameras made it even easier and more so if they have a proper AEB function.One thing is missing though, and is Dolby Vision/HDR10 for video which is a must for 360, IMO\n\"One thing is missing though, and is Dolby Vision/HDR10 for video which is a must for 360, IMO\" - There's little to no infrastructure for DV/HDR10 for stills as it is, let alone 360.\nIt is beyond irritating that a 360 camera like this doesn't have not even a basic Exposure Bracketing mode.A simple software function, which most normal cameras have !I own the X1 and have been waiting patiently for a AEB function ever since...\nAn Auto Exposure Bracketing function with the option of up to 7 exposures in Raw.They have no idea how useful this could be to create Spherical HDRI files for computer graphics and many other use cases.What a disappointment. :(\nAs far as I can tell, the One X2 has such a function (HDR & Night Shot). I would be surprised if the X3 doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have it anymore.\nThe OneX and OneX2 HDR function create a finished tonemapped 8bit\nJPEG from 3 bracketed exposures, for which the user has little control, those are not true HDR images that keep the scene dynamic range.3 exposures are not enough to cover the 14 stops of Dynamic Range contained in certain scenes Which is a common ocurrence when capturing a 360 field of view.For true 32bit linear HDRI, you need 5 or 7 bracketed exposures separated by 2EV in Raw format.As I said, this is a simple software function that Insta360 should have in every camera they sell.I thought they might reserve this function for their top of the line models, but is absent in those as well. Grrrr !\nI just tried it on my One X2 and it produced 9 raw files although the exposures were not that far apart.\nhttps://i.imgur.com/lpZtDdE.png\nWow are you sure ?My OneX produces 3, but nine sounds like overkill. It gives you the option to chose the EV gap between shots up to 4ev but as I said, only 3 exposures. I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be happy with 7.If this is the case, then I might actually buy the 1\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd sensor model.Although the X3 might be a better choice if the image quality is good enough.Thanks for sharing !\nI can choose the number of shots among 3, 5, 7, 9; as well as the EV gap among \u00b10.3, \u00b10.6, \u00b11.0; but it seems to count the ISO setting in the gap, so the range of actual focal plane exposures does not end up as wide as it would seem to imply. (In this test, shutter speeds varied between 1/5s and 1/134s.)\n(That was with the standard HDR mode. Perhaps the Night Shot mode is worth a try as well.\nEdit: no, not for this purpose. I also got 9 raw files but all of them were taken at 1/25s ISO 324, at which settings the highlights were blown.)\nThis AEB is an undocumented function that probably came with a firmware update , back when the OneX was released I was looking for AEB.It would be safe to assume that the newer X3 will have it as well, hidden under the HDR function.Thanks for letting me know.I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d be buying one for sure now.Insta360 documentarion sucks. No user manual to download.\nPhotato Why are 3 shots not enough? When I shoot for HDR I don't use more than 3. Even small sensor should be decent enough to have 10 stops in single shot, then add 2 EVs on both sides and you have your 14 stops.\n3 exposures are not enough to create clean Radiance files for IBL, that is, image based illumination of 3D computer rendered scenes which normally need from 5 to 7 bracketed exposures at 2 EV intervals.This is a pretty standard requirement to create such files, is not my opinion.\n@spider-mario - I don't understand why in the world all of these 360 camera manufacturers insist on obscenely close bracket spacing.\nIt's one of the many examples of the 360 industry being full of head-scratchingly dumb decisions, with capabilities inferior to what basic entry-level non-3D cameras have had for a decade or more.\n1EV steps as the largest option?\nSeriously?\nThat's just a waste of storage space and bandwidth given that there's easily much more than 3EV dynamic range per shot.\n2-3EV steps is far more useful/makes far more sense.\nI think I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m almost more upset that part of the 1EV gap is achieved by varying the ISO setting instead of the actual exposure. If at least it was an actual whole stop, the 9 shots would cover 8 stops + native dynamic range, but 1/5s to 1/134s as in my test is just 4.7 stops instead of 8.\n5k7 for 360 video doesn't work brilliantly, especially if you want to crop non-spherical video from it. Is it a price-point issue?\nThe QooCam 8K has been out a long time and people do get amazing results, although they seem to have a number of issues (too many for me). It would seem someone should have done a more solid 8k model by now.Group:https://www.facebook.com/groups/1401187323381005Images:https://kuula.co/profile/murino69\n\"5k7 for 360 video doesn't work brilliantly, especially if you want to crop non-spherical video from it. Is it a price-point issue?\"\nI agree though that it seems there is some issue with achieving good 8K (I've been waiting since that Kodak Pixpro 8K prototype at the end of 2017). The QooCam has 8K... but it underperforms for 8K. my guess is that it is a processor/heat/price issue.\nI've found with my X2 that 5.7K 360 cropped down to 1080p 16:9 is \"acceptable\" quality in daylight... but it the versatility, convenience and flexibility of post-capture stabilization and camera angles often makes up for the fact - particular for action sports or family videos where you don't have time to setup something more involved.\nAlso there's the issue that YouTube seem to have stopped doing 5k and now only do 4k and 8k... Recent 5k videos I've uploaded only get processed to 4k, while older ones are still available in 5k (this affects GoPro Hero 9/10 and 5k7-ish 360 camera users the most).\nBTW I've done a lot of 360 stuff but not video as quality wasn't there for me, but someday hopefully...\nP.S. The Images link in my original post isn't anything to do with me, just someone who posts a lot of QooCam pictures somewhere easy to see...\nP.P.S. 5K:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oEIDZj8w0IMUploaded at 5k but only 4k:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oaLXg0QqN7Y\nMore 5k complaints:https://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/66326653https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/w1973m/5k_2880p_option_removed_on_all_new_videos_since_1/https://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/w88xkx/uploaded_a_video_shot_by_gopro_10_at_5k_to/https://www.reddit.com/r/gopro/comments/w2rrtg/hero10_5k_videos_uploaded_on_youtube_are_only/\n\"In the single lens mode, the resolution tops out at 4K (24/25/30 fps)\"\nCurious, what is the field of view in single lens mode? is it 180\u00ba? that would need to be cropped to make it usable\nI had great time with the original X. Not great in IQ, but great versatility!\nMe too. I just have one major problem with mine in that it automatically shuts down when trying to take video in cold weather. I bought it as an action body cam for skiing... same happened a month ago when I was riding my bike around after a hailstorm. Might have to upgrade since it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s been 4+ years.\nI have to say I am a fan of insta360. Interestingly not because of its absolute IM quality, but its compact size. Besides of regular camera, I also need portable and 360 camera to shoot photo and video in special high speed situation, such as cycling event on car even on my EUC. I also have gopro fusion, which I think it has better image quality, a bit heavy though, however it is changing now.\nThe first generation X1 is okay, but buggy - which is understandable, given the fact that high data rate dealing with panaroma in camera. X2 is quite good, portable with ok video quality, but still a bit behind the gopro. ONE is all right but still no big improve in video quality, and it is a bit heavy on a 3m stick.\n1-inch 360RS I got months ago provides great video quality! But it is on the heavy side -\nusable on 3m stick, a bit ... concerning.\nNow this, X3! I bought one immediately. I never had X1 or X2\nmyself so here we go. Insta360 gets better and I hope it keeps going!\nWow. I was very impressed with the Insta360 Air (I have a little fleet of them), and Insta360 seems to be tweaking things to be better all the time. This looks pretty compelling as a waterproof action camera.\nLooks very promising.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

Here are the release dates for all Insta360 cameras, including the GO and 360-degree models. Plus, some rumors and projections for new releases.\nHere are all the Insta360 release dates. The newest Insta360 camera is the Ace Pro and Ace, released on November 21, 2023. It was preceded by the GO 3 (June 2023) and X3 (September 2022). Expect to see the X4 in September 2024.\nI own four of the newest models: X2, X3, GO 3, and Ace Pro (pictured below). And I\u2019ve used the Link webcam (best webcam I\u2019ve used). And the flow gimbal is on my list to get.\nTable of Contents\nInsta360 Release Dates (Chart)\nThis chart will be updated as new cameras are released. Below the chart, I\u2019ll also share projections and rumors about upcoming releases of new camera models.\nInsta360 Camera Release Dates by Model\nHere are the release dates for each model. This list covers all 14 Insta360 models.\nInsta360 GO 4 (Pending)\nThe new GO 4 will likely be released in June 2025.\nThe release schedule for the GO series camera has been every two years. And by choosing a summer release, they get their new camera on the market before the September release of the new GoPro camera.\nInsta360 X4 (Pending)\nThe new X4 camera will likely be released in September 2024. And 360 Rumors cites a source that that X4 won\u2019t be released in 2023.\nThe past two models (ONE X2 and X3) were released in two-year increments. The most recent model, the X3, was released in September 2022.\nInsta360 Ace Pro\nThe Ace Pro was released on November 21, 2023. I was given pre-launch access to the Ace Pro. See my detailed Insta360 Ace Pro review. This is their flagship camera.\nThe Ace Pro uses a larger sensor (1/1.3\u2033), a lens co-engineered with Leica, and shoots up to 8K24 video.\nHere\u2019s how the Ace Pro compares to the GO 3, the GoPro Hero12 Black, and the DJI Osmo Action 4.\nInsta360 Ace\nThe Ace was also released on November 21, 2023. This is a more basic version of the Ace Pro.\nLike the Ace Pro, the Ace also has a flip touch screen. Ace has a 1/2\u2033 sensor and shoots up to 6K30 video.\nInsta360 GO 3\nThe GO 3 is the smallest Insta360 camera and was released in June 2023.\nThe tiny GO3 resembles a DJI or GoPro action camera when in the base.\nInsta360 Flow Gimbal\nThe Insta360 Flow gimbal was released in March 2023.\nThe Flow is the only item on the list that isn\u2019t a camera. But because it improves video footage, it is worthy of this list. Flow has become very popular because of it\u2019s low price point and AI tracking stabilization.\nBecause this is the first gimbal by Insta360, I can\u2019t accurately predict the next model. But if they make a Flow 2, I expect to see it in the spring of 2025.\nInsta360 X3\nThe Insta360 X3 is the newest 360-degree camera by Insta360. The X3 was released in September 2022.\nAnd while it\u2019s been out for a while, I just got my X3 last week (September 2023).\nInsta360 Link (Webcam)\nThe Link webcam was released in August 2022. And it is the only camera on the list that isn\u2019t wireless.\nI recently installed a Link webcam in a conference hall and am super impressed. It has a 4K gimbal camera similar to the DJI Pocket 2. This is my recommendation for streaming events. And when it\u2019s time to upgrade my webcam, this is the one I want.\nInsta360 ONE RS 1-Inch 360\nThe ONE RS 1-Inch was released in June 2022. This came on the heels of releasing the more basic ONE RS.\nThis camera is still the standard in low-light 360-degree video footage.\nInsta360 ONE RS\nThe One RS was released in March 2022. This is a modular camera and replaced the original ONE R cameras.\nInsta360 Sphere (Drone Mount)\nThe Insta360 Sphere was released in May 2022. This camera mounts to a drone and captures footage without including the drone. It sort of works like the Insta360 Invisible Selfie Stick but for drones.\nInsta360 GO 2\nThe GO 2 was released in March 2021. This tiny action camera resembles Apple Airpods and was a pretty big hit.\nInsta360 ONE X2\nThe ONE X2 was released on October 27, 2020. This was my first Insta360 camera and my first 360-degree camera.\nInsta360 ONE R\nThe ONE R camera was released in January 2020.\nInsta360 One X\nInsta360 One X was released in October 2018.\nInsta360 One\nInsta360 One was released back in August 2017.\nInsta360 Software Release Dates\nIn addition to hardware, Insta360 also produces apps, plugins, and software for editing their footage.\nInsta360 Studio\nInsta360 Studio was released in 2019.\nIt received a notable upgrade in 2023 and includes compatiblitty with the Insta360 Plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro X. Insta360 Studio is compatible with Windows and macO.\nInsta360 App\nThe Insta360 App was released back in 2019. This iOS and Android app works great for controlling the cameras and editing footage.\nYour Turn\nWhich Insta360 camera do you own (and have your eye on)?

        "raw_content": "Meet Insta360 Ace & Ace Pro: Unrivaled Image Quality in the Smartest Ever Action Camera\nInsta360 is thrilled to announce the release of Insta360 Ace and Insta360 Ace Pro, a pair of groundbreaking, wide-angle action cameras that deliver smarter action capture powered by AI and incredible image quality.\nThe flagship version of the camera is Insta360 Ace Pro. Co-engineered with Leica, it boasts truly superior imaging performance courtesy of an elite 1/1.3\" sensor, 5nm AI chip, and Leica SUMMARIT lens. Creators can enjoy stunning 4K120fps video, 48MP photos, PureVideo for low light shooting, PD fast charging to 80% in just 22 minutes, and more. Insta360 Ace is the budget-friendly option, with the key differences being a smaller 1/2\" 48MP sensor, regular lens, and standard charging.\nBoth cameras are also packed full of unique, smart shooting features that utilize the latest in AI developments. Practical elements like a vlogging-friendly 2.4\" flip touchscreen provides excellent creative flexibility. Meanwhile, innovative functions such as the option to pause or cancel a recording, gesture and voice control, plus the brand new AI Highlights Assistant and custom-keyword based AI Warp feature transform the shooting and editing experience.\n\"With Insta360 Ace and Ace Pro, we're bringing smarter action capture to thrillseekers around the world,\" shares JK Liu, founder of Insta360. \"We're making significant steps in AI, which has allowed us to bring in new features that we think not only make the video creation process easier for users, but unlocks completely new ways to make shots truly stand out.\"\nInsta360 Ace and Ace Pro are available to order today via Insta360.com worldwide, as well as from trusted retailers such as Amazon and select authorized partners.\nUnbeatable imaging: day and night.\nAs a major determinant of a camera's image quality, Ace Pro's premium 1/1.3\" sensor immediately sets it apart from many of its competitors. It captures more light and offers far better dynamic range, making it capable of high-level performance even in fast-moving action scenarios or with challenging lighting. Not only that, but Ace Pro was co-engineered with Leica, bringing all their expertise in optical design and imaging to the camera.\nAce and Ace Pro also have a unique, dedicated shooting mode for low light: PureVideo. Powered by a 5nm AI chip, the cameras use a custom-trained AI neural network to denoise the footage for a clearer image in real time. Meanwhile, that big, beautiful sensor on Ace Pro captures huge levels of detail with impressive stabilization, even at night! This expands the use you'll get out of the camera, from twilight strolls to late-night urban shooting.\nDuring the day, again Ace Pro comes packing heat with built-in Active HDR (High Dynamic Range). This is especially helpful for shooting scenes with both bright and dark areas, with more details in the highlights and shadows and more vibrant footage. A serious amount of work has also gone into color accuracy. Ace Pro delivers accurate and rich colors, excelling even when underwater.\nAI is a key element in the overall image quality too. Insta360\u2019s dedicated R&D teams have specifically trained computational photography models, based on the cameras\u2019 unique lens and sensor data. These models underpin the 48MP Photo Mode and 4K30fps PureVideo, enhancing both the signal-to-noise ratio and dynamic range in low light, surpassing all other action cameras on the market in the process.\nA smarter way to shoot, inside and out.\nAce Pro's robust 2.4\" flip touchscreen lets you see exactly what you're shooting at all times, making framing your shots a breeze. This flexibility makes the camera incredibly useful for vlogging, selfies, hard-to-capture angles, and various action scenarios for optimal preview. What's more, a magnetic mounting system lets you quickly mount your camera and seamlessly switch between accessories. Less fussing with screws and knobs, more filming the action.\nInternally, a series of new features solve problems that have plagued action enthusiasts for years:\nWe like to make shooting as easy as possible, but every creator knows that feeling of looking at an intimidating number of files and not knowing where to start. Enter the revolutionary new tool, AI Highlights Assistant.\nFirst, it automatically detects the peak moments in a video, and delivers 'clip highlights' for in-camera review. Creators can merge every thrilling moment into one incredible recap, or choose the ones they like, and quickly delete any unwanted clips to save storage.\nAnd like magic, the Assistant will also edit your latest adventures into one epic video and push it directly to your phone or mobile device via the Insta360 app. Look back on all your Moments and relive unforgettable memories, just like the first time.\nThe Insta360 app is also packed full of advanced AI editing tools. Take advantage of slick auto-editing tools to have your clips ready in moments, or go manual with our full editing suite. There's really no limit to what you can do.\nUnlock your creativity.\nThe Ace series comes equipped with a unique Stats Dashboard and is the first action camera to integrate seamlessly with your Garmin device or Apple Watch, allowing you to overlay your videos with GPS, speed, and other data. Share your adventures with a new level of detail, whether you're cycling, running, or enjoying the great outdoors.\nAI Warp is another new creative tool, the latest addition to Insta360\u2019s expanding Shot Lab lineup. Through preset or custom keywords, you can add dynamic effects to your videos. This premium AI feature is highly customizable, giving your footage an incredibly unique twist based off of any prompt you can think of. As Insta360 continues to embrace the game-changing capabilities of AI, you can expect more features added to Shot Lab on the Insta360 app heading into 2024.\nThe Ace series also features Insta360's signature eye-popping shooting modes, including the ability to shoot timelapses, hyperlapses (in TimeShift mode) and so much more. The infamous Invisible Selfie Stick effect is also possible with the Ace series via the new AI Selfie Stick Eraser, rendering your selfie stick invisible in shots for an immersive third-person experience.\nAction anytime, and anywhere.\nWith their waterproof design, the Ace series can handle depths of up to 33 feet (10 meters). Plus, the Dive Case allows you to take your camera even deeper, down to 196 feet (60 meters).\nIt isn't just water where these cameras shine, either. They operate smoothly in temperatures as low as -20\u00b0C (-4\u00b0F), making them ideal for winter sports shooting. The cameras utilize Insta360's cutting-edge FlowState Stabilization technology, ensuring your videos remain incredibly smooth, no matter how intense the action gets. 360\u00b0 Horizon Lock takes things to the next level by keeping your videos perfectly level, even when you're on the move. So, whether you're racing down a mountain trail or capturing high-speed action shots, your footage will remain steady as a rock.\nAce Pro also prioritizes convenience with fast charging. The battery charges to 80% in just 22 minutes (full charge in 46 minutes), ensuring you spend more time capturing the action and less time waiting.\nThese action-ready cameras are perfect for outdoor enthusiasts and adventure seekers who demand high-quality performance and durability. Whether you're exploring the ocean or conquering snowy mountain peaks, the Ace series stands ready to capture your most thrilling moments.\nChampioning Winter with Shaun White\nInsta360 is excited to announce that legendary snowboarder Shaun White has joined Team Insta360 as a brand ambassador. Shaun White's passion and drive match Insta360's mission to capture the boldest action out there.\n\"I'm excited to be joining up with Insta360,\" says Shaun White. \"I like what I see with the new Ace series, so naturally I'm stoked to collaborate with the team at Insta360 and explore some of the incredible possibilities this camera can offer.\u201d\nAvailable Now\nInsta360 Ace and Ace Pro are available to order globally from Tuesday, November 21st, 2023 via Insta360.com, Amazon, and select retailers.

Find out more about how we test.\n2023 has been a massive year for Insta360. Not only have they won the prestigious T3 Awards in the best action camera category with the Insta360 X3, but they also launched several exciting products, including the Insta360 GO 3, the Insta360 X3 Invisible Dive Case, and the Insta360 Flow AI gimbal. But nothing compares to the release of the latest product from the brand, the Insta360 Ace Pro, the subject of this review.\nCo-engineered with Leica, the Insta360 Ace Pro and its smaller sibling, the Insta360 Ace, follow the success of the Insta360 ONE RS 1-Inch, which also used an optical apparatus designed by the legendary German brand. However, the new action cam's shape and functionality resemble the best GoPros, aka traditional action cameras, and is not a 360-degree unit like the RS 1-Inch.\nBut because this is Insta360 we're talking about, expect some AI-powered features, like AI Highlights and AI Warp, not to mention all the templates and auto-editing options available via the Insta360 app and Studio. There is a lot to unpack here, so let's dive in to see what you can expect from the Ace Pro and whether you should buy one today.\n[First reviewed November 2023]\nInsta360 Ace Pro review\nInsta360 Ace Pro review: price and availability\nThe Insta360 Ace Pro was announced on 21 November 2023 and is available to buy now directly from Insta360 for a recommended retail price of $450/ \u00a3430/ AU$ 729. Compared to the GoPro Hero 12 Black (RRP $400/ \u00a3400/ AU$ 650), the new Insta360 device is more expensive. The Insta360 Ace retails for a bit less and is also available to buy now for a recommended retail price of $379.99/ \u00a3359.99/ AU$ 609.\nInsta360 Ace Pro review: specifications\nInsta360 Ace Pro review: design and build quality\nThe Insta360 Ace Pro looks distinctively like an action camera. It has a rectangular body with a somewhat protruding optical excellent, a couple of physical buttons, with a large screen at the back and a smaller one at the front of the unit.\nBeing an action camera and all, the Insta360 Ace Pro can handle depths of up to 33 feet (10 meters) and up to 196 feet (60 meters) with the Dive Case, which is an optional extra. Better still, the camera can operate in temperatures as low as -20 \u00b0C (- 4\u00b0F), making it an ideal companion for winter sports.\nOf course, this description only scratches the surface. For example, that protruding optical unit was co-engineered with Leica and boasts 'superior' imaging performance. It comprises a large 1/1.3\" sensor, a 5nm AI chip, and a Leica SUMMARIT lens, ensuring excellent low-light capabilities.\nThe smaller display at the front only shows basic stats, including battery status, memory card info, and the camera's shooting mode, leaving the lion's share of work to the rear screen.\nThe pivoting 2.4\" touchscreen display has a resolution of 240 x 400 pixels and a maximum brightness of 850 nits. It's bright and responsive \u2013 no complaints there! The hinged approach ensures you can see the screen from the rear, looking down or facing the camera.\nWe saw a similar approach in the Insta360 GO 3, which sported a rectangular casing with a pivoting screen. It worked there, and seemingly, it works here, too. However, I have some concerns about the system's longevity, as fewer moving parts usually mean a longer lifecycle. I also had issues with the pivoting display in the first two weeks of testing.\nAnother thing I wanted to mention is the fabulous magnetic mounting system that lets you quickly attach the camera to whatever accessory you decide to use with your Ace Pro. The design is similar to DJI's (see also: DJI Osmo Action 4 review), and apart from the ever-so-slight wobble on the mount \u2013 which could be down to me testing a pre-production unit \u2013 it works flawlessly.\nInsta360 Ace Pro review: features\n[PLEASE NOTE: I tested the pre-production version of the camera using beta software. Some features, including the 8K resolution, AI Highlights Assistant and Active HDR, weren't available to test. The desktop Insta360 Studio wasn't ready for testing, either. I'll update this review once all functionality and features have been thoroughly tested.]\nThe Insta360 Ace Pro has numerous shooting modes, resolutions, and framerates to play with. You get the standard video mode up to 8K resolution with built-in Active HDR for videos up to 4K@30fps, FreeFrame Video (which applies image stabilisation, horizon lock and adjustable aspect ratio in post-production), Slow Motion, Starlapse, Timelapse, TimeShift, Pre-Recording, and Loop Recording.\nThe standout new feature is PureVideo, powered by a 5nm AI chip. It uses a custom-trained AI neural network to denoise the footage in real-time, resulting in a clearer image. This feature is impressive, especially because it enhances the Ace Pro's already excellent low-light performance, thanks to the large sensor and pristine Leica lens.\nPhoto modes include standard photo (up to 48MP), HDR Photo (shoots multiple images for a high dynamic range composite), Interval, Burst Photo and Starlapse, the latter of which shoots multiple photos and automatically combines them into one single starlapse image.\nOne of my favourite new features is Clarity Zoom. In certain shooting modes (e.g., standard video mode with a 16:9 image ratio in 4K@60fps), double-tapping the display allows the camera to zoom in and out without any loss of quality. 'How is this even possible?' you might ask.\nWell, the Insta360 Ace Pro's max resolution is 8K, which means that when shooting in 4K, some of the resolution is lost, so to speak. When you double-tap, all the camera does is zoom in to that middle 4K frame of the camera without losing resolution. Clever!\nThere is also Gesture Control, which allows you to use hand signals to start/stop recording or take a photo. You can also pause and record again to keep everything you want to film in one continuous file for easier file management and editing.\nInsta360 Ace Pro review: performance\nI was sent the review sample of the Insta360 Ace Pro approximately two weeks before the launch date. If you've tried action cams before, you know two weeks isn't enough time to thoroughly test all features, so what you'll find below are my initial thoughts on the device's performance, as opposed to a final summation.\nThat said, I managed to spend some quality time with the Ace Pro, and what I've seen so far is pretty impressive. I'm a big fan of both the best GoPros and Insta360's user interface, and the Ace Pro combines everything I love about both into an attractive action camera package.\nWhen I say action camera, I mean compact, rugged recording device. More and more people use action cams not just for extreme sports but also for vlogging. Top action cams have high resolution (and framerate) and image stabilisation, are easy to operate and sink into your pocket once you finish recording. They can also connect to wireless Bluetooth microphones or earbuds, which enhances audio performance when used for vlogging.\nInsta360 knows this, which is why I feel the Ace Pro is more of a vlogging camera than an action camera. It's pretty rugged, don't get me wrong, but equally, it's almost tailor-made for shooting videos where you stare at the camera, thanks to that large pivoting screen.\nThe Ace Pro has most of the cool features that make Insta360 cameras so fun to use, including the different shooting modes and the AI-powered templates and editing modes in the Insta360 app. Some of these are more novelty stuff, admittedly, like the new AI Warp, which uses machine learning to create little 4-second clips of your videos based on your input.\nIt's fun and easy enough to use, but I found that even if I edit my videos down to the required length (under 15 seconds), the AI Warp feature doesn't consider that and assumes I'd like to add the full video. More established AI-powered features work well, and I expect AI Warp to function properly once it's out of beta.\nVideo performance and image stabilisation are on point, and audio capturing is also very decent for an action camera. I was sad to learn there is no vertical shooting option onboard. GoPro added this on the Hero 12, and the Insta360 Go 3 also has a vertical shooting option, so its absence from the Ace Pro is a bit puzzling. However, future software updates could resolve this issue quickly.\nOn one occasion, I wore the Ace Pro mounted on the GoPro Chesty and let it run as long as it could (4K@60fps), for around 40 mins, at which point the memeory card ran out of space, to see if the cam overheated. Not only it didn't overheat, it almost felt cool! I was well impressed with battery performance.\nOne thing that might compromise this is the AI Highlights feature that analyses footage on camera and picks out the best bits. In my experience, this feature not only eats up battery life, it also struggles slightly with finding the best moments in the videos. I expect after refined, it will do a much better job.\nInsta360 Ace Pro review: verdict\nIt's almost impossible not to like the Insta360 Ace Pro. It has all the ingredients of the best action cameras: premium optics, a large sensor, a variety of shooting modes, easy operation, and a game-changing display. Better still, it offers loads of unique editing options via the Insta360 smartphone app and the Insta360 Studio desktop app.\nAlthough most people will probably compare the Ace Pro with its biggest rival, the GoPro Hero 12 Black, I think the two complement each other. The Hero 12 Black should still be considered the top choice for extreme sports and action shots. On the other hand, the Insta360 Ace Pro is a better option for the ever-increasing army of bloggers and various content creators.\nIt's a superb, rugged camera that fits in your pocket and can help create stunning, high-resolution videos and photos on the spot. I want to test the unit a bit longer, but I'll update this review once all the updates have been rolled out. Between you and me, I never looked forward to more testing than now!\nInsta360 Ace Pro review: also consider\nAn excellent alternative to the Ace Pro would be the Insta360's One RS. The flexible modular design is loads of fun, and the 4K boost lens delivers excellent video quality alongside the existing 360 lens module. It's a well-rounded action camera package that delivers on all fronts. Read Mark's full Insta360 One RS Twin Edition review.\nGoPro's last-gen action cam, the Hero 11 Black, is in many ways the ultimate in incremental evolution. It\u2019s a better camera than the GoPro Hero 10 Black in several areas, especially with its brilliantly boosted colour palette and improved user options, but it's almost identical in most of the other ways you can measure. And these days, it's much cheaper than the Insta360 Ace Pro.
