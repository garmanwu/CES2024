        "raw_content": "Creality at CES 2024: A Tale of Unrelenting Innovation and Visionary Leadership\nCreality, a global leader in the 3D printing industry, recently concluded its impactful presence at CES 2024, the world's most influential tech event. Taking center stage during Jan. 9-12 in Las\u00a0Vegas, Creality showcased cutting-edge innovations and reaffirmed its commitment to staying at the forefront of the industry.\nShowcasing Premier Machines at the Forefront\nAt the heart of Creality's showcase were its flagship machines, each embodying the pinnacle of technological prowess and user-centric design. These remarkable 3D printers not only demonstrated the brand's commitment to speed, precision, and versatility but also showcased Creality's continuous efforts to democratize creation and make 3D printing accessible to a global audience. Let's delve into the highlights of the machines that stole the spotlight at CES 2024.\nK1C: Taking flagship to another level\nBuilding on the success of the K1 series, the K1C emerged as the star of the show. Boasting an impressive speed of 600mm/s, an enhanced extrusion system, superior filament compatibility, and cutting-edge features like an AI camera and air filter, the K1C stands as a testament to Creality's commitment to pushing boundaries. With a specialized all-metal extruder designed for carbon fiber printing, the K1C ensures 1000 hours of clog-free extrusion, handling advanced materials such as PLA-CF and PETG-CF. Its out-of-the-box experience, featuring auto-calibration and a user-friendly AI camera for error alerts, promises seamless operation. The silent mode and open-source hardware and software ecosystem, including Creality OS and Creality Print, further enhance user customization and efficiency.\nEnder-3 V3 series: Classics reimagined\nThe Ender-3 V3, the latest addition to the Ender series, introduces a CoreXZ structure for swift motion components, precise Z-axis, and dual-axis parallelism, resulting in an astounding print speed of up to 600mm/s. Equipped with a 4.3-inch capacitive touchscreen and Creality OS, it caters to home users and 3D printing farms.\nThe Ender-3 V3 KE, featuring Creality OS, offers intelligent self-checks, remote printing, a maximum speed of 500mm/s, precision ball linear guides, dual-side cooling, and material flexibility, providing efficiency and quality. Optional accessories further elevate its capabilities.\nCR-10 SE: The\u00a0inheritor of a legend\nTargeting advanced users, the CR-10 SE boasts automatic first-layer leveling with CR Touch and pressure sensors. It excels in high-speed printing, supports various filaments, and achieves a maximum print speed of 600mm/s. Ideal for creative projects, it represents Creality's dedication to perfecting the first layer and catering to diverse printing needs.\nEcosystem gems: Creality Falcon2 (40W/22W), CR-Scan Ferret Pro\nCreality Falcon2 40W, the most powerful laser engraver in Creality's lineup, features Dynamic Spot Size Adjustment, enabling automatic spot size adjustments for engraving and cutting. With the capability to cut through 20mm wood and 0.15mm stainless steel at a speed of 25000mm/min, it also supports color engraving and air assist, ensuring precision and safety. A 22W alternative was also present that\u2019s capable of cutting through 15mm wood and 10mm black acrylic at the same formidable speed.\nThe CR-Scan Ferret Pro, an advanced 3D scanner with high-speed WiFi 6 and single-frame 3D imaging, excels at scanning dark or metallic surfaces without the need for spray. Offering 3D models with 0.1mm accuracy, it caters to various scanning needs.\nInsights and 2024 Outlook from\u00a0Creality Itself\nAs CES 2024 concluded, Creality's Overseas Sales Director, William WU, reflected on the company's remarkable journey, emphasizing a visionary outlook that encapsulated the essence of its strategic direction. In a candid post-event interview, William revisited Creality's vision where every individual holds a 3D printer, stating: \"In 2014, four founders of Creality met at an industry exhibition and were captivated by the overwhelming wave of 3D printing. Why did 3D printing have to be so far away from ordinary people? With the intention of changing the industry and the mission of bringing 3D printing to thousands, Creality was founded in 2014. And for that same reason, we are here at CES.\"\nLooking into\u00a0the future, William mentioned Creality's rebranding initiative launched at the transition from 2023 to 2024. \"This refresh wasn't merely about aesthetics,\" he declared. \"It symbolized Creality's pledge to lead the global consumer-level 3D printing ecosystem. We are steadfast in our commitment to innovation, sustainability, and unlocking new possibilities in the dynamic world of 3D printing \u2013 to truly uphold and practice our slogan of\u00a0\u2018imagine it, make it.\u2019 And that is for everyone \u2013 like I said, we\u2019re ever committed to making 3D printing accessible\u00a0to everyone. To make that happen, we\u2019re ever committed to making 3D printing usable, smart, affordable, versatile, and enjoyable.\u00a0As we propel into 2024, our vision remains clear: the evangelist\u00a0for the 3D printing industry - that knows no bounds.\u201d\nSubscribe to Our Newsletter\nSign up and save"

        "raw_content": "The curtain has fallen on CES, the world\u2019s largest consumer technology expo, and there are two highlights worth our attention\nIn recent days, the four-day \u2018Consumer Electronics Spring Festival\u2019\u2014the 2024 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES)\u2014concluded in Las Vegas, USA. It is reported that this year, the number of Chinese exhibitors and attendees reached a small peak in recent years. According to data released by CES, among the over 4,000 exhibiting companies, more than 1,100 are Chinese enterprises and their overseas branches. With AI integrating into PCs and home appliances, cars growing wings, and robots and XR entering broader scenes such as healthcare and disaster relief, the lively CES \u2018tech temple fair\u2019 seems to herald the gradual recovery of the consumer electronics industry in the coming days. Meanwhile, LED screen technology remains an indispensable focus at CES.\u201d\nThe Emerging Trend of New Display Technologies at the ExhibitionThe transparent display is undoubtedly a major attraction at the exhibition. MUXWAVE\u2019s holographic invisible screen has introduced a rapid free splicing and ultra-light ultra-thin suspension solution, utilizing P3.91 pixel pitch with no glass encapsulation, presenting a sleek and atmospheric appearance. The screen is as thin as 1.8mm and weighs only 6kg/m\u00b2. The technology of transparent display once again leaves people amazed. LED transparent screens have rapidly developed and become a new force in the commercial display field, representing an irreplaceable presence in the LED display segment. In the last two years, the LED transparent screen industry has undergone significant changes, transitioning from incremental to stock competition. The industry market is rapidly expanding, with an increase in demand, and manufacturers are competing in terms of growth rate. However, as the market reaches a saturation point, growth slows down or even stalls. In this limited market demand, competition shifts towards market share.\nXR Virtual Display Demonstrates Impressive CapabilityAccording to incomplete statistics, this exhibition has seen the participation of over 350 XR companies from around the world, including terminal manufacturers and upstream optical solution providers. In fact, concerning the XR industry, the release of the Apple Vision Pro last year rekindled interest in this sector, redirecting market attention here. According to the latest Counterpoint Global XR (VR/AR) Forecast, the shipment volume of Extended Reality (XR) headsets is expected to increase by 3.9 million units in 2024, reaching a historic high and achieving double-digit YoY growth. Augmented Reality (AR) is projected to grow by 54% YoY in 2024, reversing the downward trend of the past three years.\nMoreover, the imaginative space for combining XR virtual technology with various industries is vast, bringing more creativity and possibilities to display technology. XR technology enables intelligent adaptive displays, more accurate color matching, and, with the help of AI algorithms or large model technology, LED displays achieve more intelligent content display, advertising delivery, command decisions, and more. Integrated with smart home and smart office scenarios, enhancing the efficiency of LED displays may bring about more comfortable visual effects or higher work efficiency in the future.\u201d\nWatsApp\uff1a\nE-mail\uff1a\nMarketing Center\uff1a4th Floor East, Building 4, Shenzhen Software Park, No.2 Gaoxinzhong 2nd Road, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, P.R.China\nProduction Base\uff1aRoom 401,Building G,Guancheng Low Carbon Industrial Park,Shangcun Community,\nGongming Street, Guangming District, Shenzhen,Guangdong,China\n\u00a9 2024 Shenzhen MUXWAVE\u00a0 Technology Co., Ltd.\nAll Rights Reserved \u7ca4ICP\u59072022137224\u53f7\nLinksLED display | LED holographic screen\nUsername or email\u00a0*\nPassword\u00a0*\nRemember me\nLogin\nLost your password?"

The number of Chinese companies is more than the 1,000 that state-run tabloid Global Times reported for the 2020 show. CTA said the show has attracted around 4,000 exhibitors, although numbers are not final yet. Kelley said CES expects to see 130,000 attendees.\nAlibaba was highlighted as one of the exhibitors using machine learning platforms to \u201cpower e-commerce\u201d.\nEven much smaller companies are touting their use of AI. Govee, a smart lighting maker from Shenzhen, is advertising the use of generative AI to help people create specific moods, like asking for a backdrop that is evocative of the Hong Kong skyline or Barbie Dreamhouse.\nXpeng is among the major electric vehicle makers at the show, where it will be demonstrating its new \u201cflying car\u201d, the AeroHT.\nTikTok and its Beijing-based owner ByteDance have been under intense political scrutiny in Washington over data privacy and national security concerns. This may not have deterred TikTok from showing up to the largest consumer electronics shows in its largest market.\nNumber of Chinese tech firms at CES 2023 less than half of pre-pandemic level\nRepresentatives from the company will join two panels at the show to discuss sports and entertainment. Beyond entertainment, though, ByteDance makes much of its money through advertising and has been trying to grow its e-commerce business.\nOther Chinese companies cannot exhibit at the show even if they want to because they have been listed on Washington\u2019s Entity List. This includes the world\u2019s largest drone maker DJI and a number of semiconductor companies.\n\u201cFrom a show management perspective, we welcome participation from every company,\u201d CTA\u2019s Kelley said. \u201cAs a US-based trade association, we cannot allow participation if they are on some sort of Entity List. That\u2019s really the only place where we will not allow participation.\u201d\nStill, CES may be more important for the many small firms that make up the bulk of the show\u2019s exhibition floor. It remains the premier event of its kind.\n\u201cWe like to make the case that the four days you spend in Las Vegas is some of the most efficient use of your time in the sense that you don\u2019t have to necessarily travel the world to meet with individual business partners on six different continents,\u201d said Kelley. \u201cInstead, you can come to Las Vegas and meet everybody that you need to meet from the global technology industry over the course of a week.\u201d"

Please beware of fraudulent imitation to avoid possible losses.\nThank you for your attention.\nGuangdong Toy Association\nGuangzhou Li Tong Messe Frankfurt Co Ltd\n70,000+ Trade Visitors\n1,400+ In-person & Online Exhibitors\n130,000 Gross Sqm\n2023 Fair Impression\nWe are joining the Hong Kong 3C pavilion to promote our brands to the Mainland market. We are glad that the fairs could be held amidst the pandemic, it sent a positive message to companies like us, as well as to the business community in the Greater Bay Area and the whole of China. This year, our booth was in a great location next to the main entrance which helped to drive a lot of traffic. It has been the busiest morning ever, I have connected with a large amount of visitors from the e-commerce sector, retail stores, wholesalers, supermarkets, and pre-school educational product sellers.\nToy & Edu China has a huge industry influence and attracts a large number of well-known local and overseas brands each year. It also serves as a benchmark for learning about the industry\u2019s latest developments. The show has attracted a lot of visitors from across the country, particularly from Guangdong, Guangxi and Fujian. We have achieved vast media exposure, and ultimately opened up new opportunities in Shenzhen and the markets nearby via the help of the show. It\u2019s a valuable opportunity for us to build up our brand, communicate directly with customers and let them touch and feel our products, and ultimately give customers the confidence to cooperate with us.\nThe fair is an ideal platform for companies to get a foothold in the Greater Bay Area. From the customers\u2019 responses on our new products, and also the pre-orders we have got, we are confident about the toy market.\nWe are grateful to the fair organisers for providing a gathering platform for the toy industry for deeper interactions. Also, the fair allows us to exchange views on the market changes and product ideas with our fellow peers.\nOur booth has been very busy and buyers who expressed interests in our products are from distributors for online and offline channels, supermarkets and malls, family restaurants and more. The visitors are more professional with clear sourcing needs as they know a lot about toys.\nWe came to Toy & Edu China mainly to find new customers in the toy industry, as well as to maintain contacts with existing ones. We entered into negotiations with quite a few exhibitors and will continue to follow-up with them later. The toy market is changing quite a lot, with new products and models launched every year. There are also seminars related to cross-border trade and the logistics industry which are definitely worth learning from.\nWe are mainly a cross-border e-commerce retailer and we want to expand our product range, particularly for educational toys for the 3 \u2013 10 year age group. Toy & Edu China helps us to do this; many leading toy companies in the Greater Bay Area as well as international toy brands are gathered here at the fair. We can also see pre-launched products and are able to place orders ahead of the market. It\u2019s easier for us to select toy products at the physical fair with the price points and quality that meet our requirements.\nWe came to Licensing China to look for new cooperation with IP licensing exhibitors. The fair is highly integrated with Toy & Edu China and Baby & Stroller China, and the exhibitors here are eager to cooperate with toy and baby product suppliers. From the fair, we found that licensing companies are now customising business development solutions for their partners and even sharing application examples of their IP, which has made this trip very rewarding for us. Due to the pandemic, we haven't had face-to-face communication with so many companies for a long time, so we couldn\u2019t miss such a good opportunity.\nDownloads\nLive post\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consetetur sadipscing elitr, sed diam nonumy eirmod tempor\ninvidunt ut labore et dolore magna aliquyam erat, sed diam voluptua.
