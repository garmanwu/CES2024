        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

The new arrangement will cater more effectively to consumers during important Chinese and international sourcing seasons each year. Taking place from 24 \u2013 26 March 2022, the CCBEC Spring edition is the first of the two events to be held next year, and will take place at the Shenzhen World Exhibition & Convention Center, gathering a collective of quality Chinese suppliers and internationally renowned e-commerce platforms.\nShare\nCommenting on the change, Ms Wendy Wen, Senior General Manager at Messe Frankfurt (HK) Ltd, says: \u201cShenzhen is the hub for the cross-border e-commerce industry, while it also enjoys strategic location advantages and substantial industry resources. Perfectly situated in Shenzhen, CCBEC attracts a diverse range of quality suppliers, leading e-commerce platforms and service providers. To help industry players align with various holiday and industry sourcing seasons around the world, we will organise spring and autumn editions starting from 2022. This step will also allow participants to keep up with new products and industry developments on a seasonal basis.\"\nLaunched successfully in 2021, the inaugural edition of CCBEC received huge support and compliments from industry partners, exhibitors and visitors, confirming the enormous potential of China's cross-border e-commerce industry as well as the show\u2019s effectiveness. Building on this success, CCBEC Spring will open its doors again in 2022, occupying 70,000 sqm of exhibition space and welcoming 1,200 exhibitors from the entire industry chain, including manufacturers and suppliers, cross-border service providers and products, as well as e-commerce platforms and media. \u00a0To allow participants to capitalise on the peak Chinese retail season in the first half of the year, CCBEC Spring has been moved to the end of March instead of April.\nBenefit from favourable policies\nE-commerce is a new growth driver for trade around the world and China is no exception. In the first half of 2021, China's cross-border e-commerce import and export volume reached USD 140 billion, a year-on-year increase of 28.6%.[1] All signs are pointing to cross-border e-commerce as a new driving force for overseas trade, and an important channel for business transformation.\n[1] The State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China:\u00a0http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-10/15/content_5642711.htm, published 15 October 2021\nThe tremendous prospects for the industry have been noted by the Chinese government.

The show attracted 100,958 visits from industry buyers to source and build business partnerships with 2,052 suppliers, e-commerce platforms and supporting service providers across six halls in more than 120,000 sqm of exhibition space.\nShare\nWith extensive backing from supporting organisations, the show delivered a comprehensive platform for cross-border e-commerce sellers, quality manufacturers and service providers to conduct business, expand industry networks and exchange information, helping participants to capitalise on the emerging opportunities in the global e-commerce trade.\nCCBEC is co-organised by the China Chamber of International Commerce, China Merchants Exhibition Management (Shenzhen) Co Ltd, Messe Frankfurt (Shenzhen) Co Ltd, Beijing Talent International Exhibition Co Ltd and Shenzhen OCT Greater Bay Development Co Ltd. \u201cThe show was launched to help industry practitioners ride on the recent growth of cross border e-commerce and the digital transformation of SMEs, and this was rewarded with strong exhibitor and visitor attendance \u2013 confirming the excellent timing for the debut, amid a surge of e-commerce, especially resulting from the pandemic,\u201d said Ms Wendy Wen, Senior General Manager at Messe Frankfurt (HK) Ltd.\nMany of the industry\u2019s biggest names were in attendance, and they shared a similar view that the fair\u2019s strategic location is irreplaceable for bringing industry practitioners together, as Shenzhen is a crucial city in the Guangdong\u2013Hong Kong\u2013Macau Greater Bay Area and a well-established destination for cross-border e-commerce in terms of logistics, supporting services, and streamlined customs and government policies. The first show attracted the likes of Alibaba, AliExpress, Tmall International, eBay, Shopee, Walmart, Made-in-China.com, Google and Sinotrans. A collective of quality suppliers covering nearly every consumer goods category were also present to extend their customer reach.\nMr Ma Jun, General Manager of China Merchants Exhibition Management (Shenzhen) Co Ltd noted: \u201cCCBEC plays a part in fostering the development and expansion of the cross-border e-commerce industry. Leveraging Shenzhen\u2019s ample industrial resources and the policy advantages of the Qianhai Bay Free Trade Port Zone, we strive to deepen the integration between the cross-border e-commerce industry and related sectors such as consumer goods, health care, as well as consulting and payment services. This will further strengthen Shenzhen's position as a stepping stone for Chinese brands to extend their reach to overseas markets. We would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere thanks to our partners, exhibitors and visitors for their enormous support, and I look forward to meeting all of you in the next edition.\u201d\nBesides deal-making, education and support were also on the agenda. Many participants reported that they were impressed by the comprehensiveness of the fringe programme, and the exclusive insights and analysis that speakers shared. Audience members explained that their participation was worthwhile because they not only benefited from in-depth discussions on almost every aspect of the industry, but they also found useful solutions to various practical issues as well as guidance to stay ahead in the fiercely competitive market. \u00a0Five major areas including industry development, policy and regulations, marketing strategies, supporting services, as well as investment and financing were covered in the fringe programme.\nExhibitors\u2019 voices\n\u201cWe are happy to take part in the first edition of CCBEC. I can see the organisers have put a lot of effort into promotion as the show has had a successful debut, converging a huge amount of cross border platform sellers, manufacturers and other players from the supply chain. The fair also provides the relevant information, products and support that are essential for industry development. In addition to being an exhibitor, we also spoke at the forum section to introduce our latest policies in helping brands to grow their foreign trade business. As one of the pioneers in the cross border e-commerce business, we will support local brands in China to expand overseas through participating in this fair.\u201d\nMr Angus Wen, Business Development Manager, eBay\n\u201cShenzhen is a hotspot for cross border e-commerce, we have set up an operation centre with our own team here. The show provides us with an irreplaceable opportunity to connect with sellers and service providers. We have met with many of our Shenzhen based business partners here at CCBEC, and also engaged with some quality new sellers who are eager to join our platform. The show has been filled with positive vibes and industry players who are looking forward to establishing business connections with each other.\u201d\nMs Yvoone Huang, Senior Manager (China Region), Newegg Global Selling, Newegg Inc\n\u201cSouth China is one of the most developed regions for cross border e-commerce and Shenzhen is the centre stage of the sector. Our company\u2019s headquarters are also set up in the city as we benefit from Shenzhen being the hub for cross border logistics. It is a good decision to locate the show in Shenzhen so that it can better integrate the supply chain resources in the area. We also hope that the show can unite the entire cross-border logistics supply chain including freight forwarding companies, dedicated line companies, overseas warehouse companies, and ERP service providers.\u201d\nMr Nelson Liu, Cofounder, Newtrans\n\u201cOur mission is to learn how to better promote and package our products on the cross border e-commerce platform, and also to let the industry know what we have to offer. CCBEC has provided an ideal networking platform for us to conduct business. Thanks to the organisers\u2019 efforts in promotion, most of the customers we met here are very well prepared with clear targets and we have held constructive conversations with them. Shenzhen is home to a large group of cross-border e-commerce companies. Their ideas, business models and innovations can help us to develop products that better suit their needs.\u201d\nMs Vicky Sun, Sales Manager, Nanlong Group Co Ltd\n\u201cThe pandemic has encouraged us to transition away from our traditional trading channels such as exhibitions in favour of digital platforms to market our product and communicate with customers. However, we still need a face-to-face platform to talk to our clients so that they truly understand the design and quality of our products. CCBEC meets both our needs by providing in person encounters together with opportunities to promote the growth of our cross border e-commerce business. By joining this Shenzhen fair we are hoping to reach more of our customers in South China.\u201d\nMr Anson Cai, Vice President, Chaozhou Qingfa Ceramics Co Ltd\n\u201cCCBEC has played an important role in bringing our children\u2019s apparel brand to the international market as Shenzhen is a gateway to international e-commerce. We have had a successful show and received positive feedback from franchisees and agents. CCBEC has helped increase our brand exposure, recruit more franchisees and find the right suppliers. Also, the fair has been strongly supported by the local government. It is a must attend international trade fair for brands like us.\u201d\nMr Shuilong Chen, Chairman of Longyu Group, Founder of Seven Life\nBuyers\u2019 thoughts\n\u201cAs a cross-border e-commerce seller, we normally communicate and make purchases with our existing suppliers online and so we\u2019ve never met each other in person before. Today at the fairground we finally met for the first time and they introduced their new products to us. We also had the opportunity to collect the contacts of many new suppliers from other regions. At the show, we explored a variety of different product segments, talked to some of the exhibitors and gathered some samples. CCBEC is like a treasure trove for us. Unlike many trade fairs of its kind, CCBEC doesn\u2019t just focus on service providers, but also consumer goods. It\u2019s the largest trade fair we\u2019ve ever visited and it certainly broadens our horizons. We have discovered many new suppliers, and it\u2019s especially useful that we can talk directly with original suppliers and manufacturers.\u201d\nMr Jason Dong, General Manager, Shan Xi Huan Qiu Yi Mao E-commerce Co Ltd\n\u201cThe manufacturers at CCBEC specialising in overseas export are very professional because they have good knowledge of consumer habits in overseas countries, and can provide accurate product quotations as well as updates on international e-commerce. So far I have held discussions with six manufacturers that I intend to cooperate with, and I may visit their factories after the show. CCBEC has exceeded my expectations and I think that this is indeed a convergence point for high quality exhibitors.\u201d\nMr Yang Yongjian, General Manager, Hong Kong You Yi Ya Trading Co Ltd\n\u201cThe main purpose of my visit is to find beauty and hairdressing products. Since we use Amazon FBA to fulfill our orders, we target small and light products that are suitable for air transportation. So far, I have found two desirable products that match my criteria. The show scale is extremely large, and there are many suppliers as well as a wide variety of new products. The service providers at the show are very patient and provided me with professional answers and solutions to my questions. It has been a very successful trip for me.\u201d\nMr Yang Peng, General Manager, He Jin Hua Ou Trading Co Ltd\nSpeakers\u2019 comments\n\u201cAlthough a number of the participating companies at the fringe programme are already engaging in cross-border e-commerce, most of them have just begun to take their first steps into the field. We are pleased to share our knowledge, products, capabilities and customer service experience with these companies to provide them with the opportunities to succeed.\u201d\nMr Sparks Yuan, Director of B2B Business Greater China, Payoneer\n\u201cThe CCBEC Shenzhen Industry Summit plays an important role in the show. Shenzhen is a crucial city for the cross-border e-commerce industry, and even for the wider Chinse economy. The city has delivered plenty of e-commerce innovations, including services, products and transaction models. I think CCBEC is an essential step for development \u2013 it brings industry players from the cross-border e-commerce community together, and promotes the future of the industry in Shenzhen.\u201d\nMr Jian Wang, Professor of International Business and E-business, University of International Business and Economics (UIBE), Beijing, China.\n\u201cToy companies are looking for new channels to increase their production, exports and sales, and cross-border e-commerce is seen as a new channel for them to achieve this. It is having a growing influence on the toy business and is occupying a rising proportion of their sales volume. The seminar programme at this fair provided a bridge to connect both exhibitors and buyers, it fosters communication and idea exchange among industry players.\u201d\nMr Chen Huangman, Vice President of Guangdong Toy Association\nAudience member\u2019s comments\n\u201cCCBEC is not only large in terms of scale, but it also offers excellent trade fair services, a comprehensive range of products, and a line-up of supporting resources for cross-border e-commerce.\u00a0 A series of seminars are also arranged throughout the show. I attended Alibaba Group\u2019s forum where plenty of useful sourcing information was covered. The speaker also shared some back-end procurement data with the audience which we can use to make a better product procurement plan for the next quarter.\u201d\nMr Wang Peng, General Manager, Shan Xi Yi Mei Jia Jing Technology Co Ltd\nThe China (Shenzhen) Cross Border E-commerce Fair is co-organised by the China Chamber of International Commerce, China Merchants Exhibition Management (Shenzhen) Co Ltd, Messe Frankfurt (Shenzhen) Co Ltd, Beijing Talent International Exhibition Co Ltd and Shenzhen OCT Greater Bay Development Co Ltd.

        "raw_content": "Menu\nInvesting in Shenzhen: Industry, Economics, and Policy\nOften dubbed China\u2019s Silicon Valley, Shenzhen is China\u2019s fastest-growing city. It is ranked by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences as the mainland\u2019s top city for \u201coverall economic competitiveness\u201d and is China\u2019s premier Special Economic Zone (SEZ) for foreign investment as well as a sub-provincial class city.\nShenzhen was declared China\u2019s first SEZ by then-Communist Party (CCP) chairman Deng Xiaoping in 1979. Aided by capital flowing easily from neighboring Hong Kong, the city has since transformed from a small fishing town to a\u00a0bustling megacity.\nEvery year, millions flock to its city center as part-time or migrant workers, entrepreneurs from around the globe seek to benefit from its investment-friendly practices, and tourists admire its futuristic landscape.\nLocated in Guangdong province only 100 km (62 miles) southeast of its capital, Guangzhou, Shenzhen is strategically located on the Pearl River Delta that serves as a border with Hong Kong. The city center is under 20 minutes from Kowloon by fast train. Other nearby cities include Zhongshan, Dongguan, and Foshan.\n2021 economic overview\nShenzhen is China\u2019s third-largest city by GDP after Shanghai and Beijing. GDP in 2021 surpassed the RMB 3 trillion mark, up 6.7 percent from the previous year. This is a significant recovery from the 3.1 percent year-on-year growth in 2020. Shenzhen also has the highest per capita of any city in China, reaching RMB 173,663 (US$25,889) in 2021.\nShenzhen is a service-driven economy, with the tertiary sector accounting for almost 63 percent of GDP. Manufacturing nonetheless remains an important mainstay industry, accounting for almost all of the remaining value-add to GDP.\nAccording to the Outline Development Plan for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), Shenzhen is one of four core cities to serve as the engines for development in the region. Shenzhen is frequently called upon to be the GBA\u2019s technology and R&D hub. As of 2018, four percent of Shenzhen\u2019s GDP was invested in research and over 11,000 high-tech enterprises called the city home.\nForeign trade and investment\nShenzhen is China\u2019s largest exporting city, ranking first among China\u2019s main cities for 29 years in a row. The Port of Shenzhen is the fourth-largest in the world, with annual throughput reaching 28.77 million TEUs in 2021, up 8.4 percent from the previous year.\nIn 2021, Shenzhen\u2019s trade in goods grew at a rate of 16.2 percent year-on-year to reach RMB 3.54 trillion (US$528.3 billion). Exports grew 13.5 percent year-on-year to reach RMB 1.9 trillion (US$283.9 billion), while imports surged 19.5 percent, reaching RMB 1.6 trillion (US$239 billion).\nThe growth rate of trade significantly outpaced that of 2020, when trade in goods grew 2.4 percent year-on-year, exports grew 1.5 percent, and imports grew 3.6 percent. The 2021 uptick in foreign trade is reflected in high trade numbers nationwide, as China benefitted from strong demand from overseas consumers who were still under COVID-19 restrictions and a relative lack of COVID-19 restrictions at home enabling high rates of production.\nShenzhen exported the highest volume of goods to Hong Kong, with exports to the special administrative region reaching a total of RMB 707.5 billion (US$105.7 billion), a growth rate of 17.3 percent year-on-year. Meanwhile, Shenzhen imported the largest volume of goods from ASEAN, with imports from the 10-country region reaching RMB 356 billion (US$53.2 billion), up 11.1 percent year-on-year.\nActual use of foreign capital grew 26.3 percent in 2021, reaching US$11 billion. A total of 5,788 new FDI projects were signed throughout the year.\nA total of US$3.1 billion went to leasing and business services, accounting for the largest proportion \u2013 28.7 percent \u2013 of actual use of foreign capital. The second-largest sector was information transmission, software, and IT services, which accounted for 28 percent of the total, receiving US$3 billion in actual use of foreign capital.\nIndustry development\nHigh-tech industries\nThe technology industry is the beating heart of Shenzhen\u2019s economy and leads the country in the digital economy. Some of the largest names in the technology industry are headquartered in Shenzhen \u2013 Huawei, Tencent, ZTE, and DJI, to name a few.\nShenzhen\u2019s 14th Five Year Plan (14th FYP), the city\u2019s main economic development plan for the period from 2021 to 2025, targets for the \u201ccore digital economy industries\u201d to reach 31 percent by 2025 \u2013 considerably higher than the national target of 10 percent. By the end of 2021, Shenzhen had almost already hit this target, with this sector accounting for 30.6 percent of GDP, surpassing RMB 900 billion (US$134.5 billion) in scale.\n\u201cCore digital economy industries\u201d refers to digital technologies, products, services, infrastructure, and solutions for the digital development of industries and various economic activities that are completely dependent on digital technologies and data elements.\nThe tech and digital industries are also major employers, and the city is home to a large number of highly skilled tech workers. At the end of 2021, there were over two million professional technical workers, of which 617,000 held at least a mid-level technical job title.\nShenzhen is also a pioneer in developing regulations for emerging and high-tech industries, acting as a test bed for regulations for high-tech and emerging industries such as artificial intelligence (AI), autonomous driving, and data privacy.\nIndustry and manufacturing\nManufacturing remains an important mainstay industry in Shenzhen\u2019s economy. The industry recovered significantly in 2021 after a lull in 2020 as the sector was impacted by the pandemic. High-tech manufacturing grew at a rate of 4.7 percent year-on-year in 2021, up from 2.3 percent in 2020. The profits of industrial enterprises also rebounded in 2021, with the profits of industrial enterprises above designated size (companies with the main business income of at least RMB 20 million (US$3 million)).\nMultiple manufacturing sectors saw explosive growth in 2021, including new energy vehicles (173.9 percent year-on-year), industrial robots (60.5 percent), smartphones (40.9 percent), and 3D printing (21.2 percent).\nManufacturing accounts for the largest industry by employment, with over four million people employed in the sector at the end of 2020, according to the 2021 Shenzhen Statistical Yearbook released by the Shenzhen Municipal Bureau of Statistics.\nMajor companies with a presence in Shenzhen include electronics manufacturer Foxconn and battery manufacturer CATL.\nFinance\nPreliminary statistics show that Shenzhen\u2019s finance industry grew at a rate of 7.6 percent year-on-year in 2021 to reach a total of RMB 473.9 billion (US$70.8 billion), accounting for 15.4 percent of GDP. The two-year average growth rate of the industry also surpassed the national average (5.3 percent), growing at a rate of 8.3 percent.\nTotal assets of the city\u2019s banking sector amounted to RMB 11.3 trillion (US$1.7 trillion) at the end of 2021, a growth rate of 7.83 percent year-on-year. Meanwhile, in the insurance sector, the total assets of the city\u2019s 27 corporate insurance companies reached RMB 5.75 trillion (US$859.3 billion).\nMajor financial institutions headquartered in Shenzhen include Ping\u2019an Bank and China Merchant\u2019s Bank. HSBC, Standard Chartered, and Citibank also all have a presence in the city.\nShenzhen policy trends\nOn August 18, 2019, the Party\u2019s leading committee on reform, the Central Comprehensive Deepening Reforms Commission (CCCDR), announced new plans for expanding the city\u2019s role on the national stage.\nBenchmark dates include:\nIn education:\nIn healthcare:\nAdditionally, the charter states that the city will begin, \u201cExploring the securitization of intellectual property rights\u201d and \u201cstandardizing the orderly construction of property rights trading centers for intellectual property and scientific and technological achievements.\u201d\nWhile the actual steps Shenzhen will take to secure intellectual property (IP) have not been made clear at this time, the language implies a greater shift by the country to comply with IP concerns from foreign enterprises and encourage their continued investment within the city.\nShenzhen key development areas\nShenzhen Economic Zone\nShenzhen\u2019s Special Economic Zone (SEZ) was expanded in 2010 from four districts to the entire city. Businesses within the Shenzhen SEZ enjoy a wide range of tax exemptions, grants and loans, and reduced rates. These notably include:\nQianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone\nQianhai Cooperation Zone is an experimental business zone to facilitate financial, logistics, and IT services activity between Mainland China and Hong Kong. It currently covers an area of 15 square kilometers on the east coast of the Pearl River Delta, covering three areas, namely Guiwan, Qianwan, and Mawan.\nIn September 2021, the State Council released the Plan to Comprehensively Deepen Reform and Opening Up of the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone (the Qianhai Plan), which lays the development blueprint for the area over the next five years, with additional long-term goals set for the year 2035.\nThe Qianhai Plan will seek to expand the area of the cooperation zone from the current 14.92 square kilometers to over 120 square kilometers covering four zones.\nThe Qianhai Plan aims to further integrate Hong Kong and Macao\u2019s economies into the GB and demands the zone liberalize services trade and open the financial sector further, including through supporting links to Hong Kong\u2019s financial market. This would allow for cross-border renminbi use, facilitating management of foreign exchange and further supporting cross-border security investments.\nIncentive policies for foreign investment in Shenzhen\nShenzhen is one of mainland China\u2019s most business-friendly cities. Companies that seek to set up and expand into the area can benefit from a range of beneficial policies, including reduced tax rates, rewards for contributions to key industries, talent incentives, and more. Below we list some of the incentive policies currently available in Shenzhen.\nIIT subsidy for foreign talent in the GBA\nForeign talent working in Shenzhen can benefit from the IIT subsidy policy available in all nine mainland cities of the GBA. Successful applicants can get subsidies equal to the portion of the IIT paid in the GBA city in excess of 15 percent of the taxpayer\u2019s taxable income for the previous year. This policy is available until 2024 when applications for IIT subsidies for the year 2023 can be submitted.\nSee our full Q&A on the application process for the IIT subsidy here.\nReduced CIT rate for qualified companies in Qianhai\nFrom January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2025, qualified enterprises engaged in encouraged industries in the Qianhai Shenzhen-Hong Kong Modern Service Industry Cooperation Zone (\u201cQianhai) are able to enjoy a reduced CIT rate of 15 percent, below China\u2019s national CIT rate of 25 percent.\n\u201cEncouraged industries\u201d refers to sectors included in the 2021 version of the Catalogue for Encouraged Industries Eligible for CIT Preferential Treatment. This Qianhai\u2019s new CIT Preferential Catalogue covers 30 sectors under five broad industry categories \u2013 modern logistics, information services, technology services, cultural and creative industries, and commercial services.\nTo be eligible for the reduced CIT rates, companies must derive at least 60 percent of their revenue from one of the industries in the catalogue. On June 2, 2022, the Shenzhen Municipal Government released a guide to determining eligibility for the reduced CIT rate.\nFor more on the reduced CIT rate for companies in Qianhai, see our related article here.\nIncentives for headquartering in Shenzhen\nFor the establishment of headquarters of companies (subject to the requirements of The Implementations Measures for Encouraging the Development of Headquarters in Shenzhen), subsidies granted may be up to RMB 20 million (US$3 million).\nFor financial enterprises headquarters, subsidies may be up to RMB 10 million (US$1.5 million) and 50 percent of support for relocation costs. In the case of establishments of logistics companies, these aids may be in the amount of RMB 10 million (US$1.5 million), depending on the amount of registered capital of the company in question.\nShenzhen COVID-19 restrictions and relief measures\nShenzhen has experienced a series of COVID-19 outbreaks in recent months, which has impacted the city\u2019s economic activity. In March 2022, the government imposed a city-wide lockdown lasting one week, which led to the closure of businesses, including major factories.\nAt the time of writing, Shenzhen is once again imposing COVID-19 restrictions in response to a small outbreak, with restrictions including locking down a district bordering Hong Kong, suspending some public transport services, and imposing city-wide testing.\nAs in the rest of China, Shenzhen imposes the strict \u201czero-COVID\u201d (also called \u201cdynamic zero-COVID\u201d) policy, which takes wide-ranging measures to maintain the case count to a minimum. This often results in lockdowns of the affected neighborhoods and districts\nHowever, Shenzhen has been considerably more successful in maintaining zero-COVID than other cities in China, managing to swiftly stop the spread of small outbreaks using targeted and localized measures. The full lockdown in March lasted only one week (although some restrictions remained in place for longer), much shorter than the two-month lockdown that Shanghai underwent. This has enabled the city to run at relative normalcy with less disruption to economic activity as compared to other regions.\nIn addition, Shenzhen has rolled out a series of relief measures to assist companies that have been impacted by COVID-19, in addition to the nationwide relief and support measures. At the end of March, Shenzhen released a set of 30 relief measures to assist struggling businesses. These include:\nThe measures also include specific relief policies for companies in hard-hit industries, such as manufacturing, catering, retail, and transport and logistics.\nSee our articles on VAT rebates for more information on the tax relief measures available for businesses.\nThis article was originally published on September 17, 2019 and was last updated on July 1, 2022.\nAbout Us\nChina Briefing is written and produced by Dezan Shira & Associates.

        "raw_content": "China consumption: Start of a new era\nAfter an encouraging start in the first quarter of this year, second-quarter and third-quarter consumption data confirms what many in the industry have already come to accept: the era of double-digit growth in China\u2019s retail sector is over.\nThird-quarter retail sales of goods grew by only 3 percent, with the recent Double Eleven shopping festival eking out a mere 2 percent increase over the previous year. This slowdown is evident across various categories, including cosmetics (3 percent), clothing (4 percent), and appliances (0.8 percent), when compared to the already subdued third quarter of the pandemic-impacted 2022. Despite a promising 7.5 percent uptick in retail sales in October, there are currently few indications that China will see a fundamental reversal in this trend. (Exhibit 1)\nDespite initial signs of recovery in consumer sentiment earlier in the year, it has since plateaued, hovering around its all-time low since April. Factors contributing to this include a significant drop in residential property transactions\u2014a past pillar of wealth creation\u2014alongside declining exports and concerns about geopolitical tensions.\u00a0(Exhibit 2)\nDespite a 5 percent surveyed unemployment rate in urban areas and a continued 6 percent annual increase in disposable incomes, including in 2023, consumers remain cautious about spending, especially on properties. Household savings rates are still significantly higher than pre-COVID levels (34 percent versus 30 percent), with limited signs yet of the additional RMB 53 trillion in savings accumulated since 2020 being funneled into consumption. This equates to an extra RMB 38,000 in the bank accounts of each consumer, awaiting expenditure.\nA notable exception is the service sector, particularly in travel and entertainment. After years of restricted mobility, there\u2019s renewed enthusiasm for travel and socializing in restaurants and bars (both sectors topped the list in terms of rate of growth in McKinsey\u2019s most recent ConsumerWise survey of Chinese consumers). Foodservice sector growth\u2014a robust 19 percent year-to-date and 14 percent in Q3 over 2022\u2014is partly due to a lower comparative base from previous years and consumers\u2019 increased spending on dining and travel.\nDomestic travel has rebounded to surpass 2019 levels, and travel to Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Macao is approaching pre-pandemic figures (83 percent of 2019 levels in September). While international travel remains at around half of 2019 levels, this is primarily attributed to visa restrictions and high flight prices. The shift from product to service consumption is expected to continue into 2024.\u00a0(Exhibit 3)\nDouble Eleven\nDouble Eleven, the world\u2019s largest shopping festival, warrants closer examination. This year, while sales inched up by just 2 percent over last year, it nonetheless reached a staggering RMB 1.1 trillion in GMV across all platforms, surpassing the annual consumption of some entire economies. The event\u2019s sheer scale offers valuable insights into Chinese consumer behavior:\nWidening performance gap between the winners and the losers\nOur analysis of 80 leading, publicly-listed consumer companies with a majority of revenues from mainland China reveals a nuanced picture. These companies, mostly Chinese with a few multinational corporations having spun off their China businesses, span various sectors and show varying performance levels. While overall growth trends towards low single-digits, we observed substantial differences among these companies.\nOne-quarter of these companies experienced year-to-date double-digit growth, while 12 percent suffered double-digit declines. Success appears to be linked to innovation in brand launches and business models, and quick, agile responses to changing market and consumer dynamics.\nPerformance discrepancies can also be attributed to sectoral differences. Restaurants and pharmacies, for instance, have generally outperformed offline retail. However, within individual sectors, there\u2019s a growing divide between high-performing and low- performing companies. As consumer demand no longer expands at past rates, we anticipate further widening in company performance. Factors such as high-quality products, premium branding, and rapid, insights-driven responses to market changes will continue to be key success indicators.\u00a0(Exhibit 5)\nStill cautious,still optimistic\nSo, what does this mean for the future, and where does it leave my cautious optimism? It\u2019s still very much present. China\u2019s economy is steadily evolving towards being more consumption-driven. Retail growth, encompassing both products and services, is expected to rise by 5 percent this year, with similar projections for the coming years. Given China\u2019s vast market size, this translates to an additional RMB 10 trillion in retail sales over the next 5 years. To put things into perspective, such growth would make China the single-largest growth market globally.\nIncremental growth at this scale would be equal to the combined retail sales of India, Indonesia, and South Korea today.\nWhile recovery may be slower than anticipated and low consumer sentiment could dampen growth rates in the coming months, the long-term prospects of the Chinese market remain robust. According to simulations by the McKinsey Global Institute the number of upper-middle and high-income households may reach 200 million by 2025 and 260 by 2030. The number of high-income cities are projected to hit 82 by 2025 and 93 by 2030.\nContinued urbanization and rising income levels are expected to sustainably drive consumption growth in the medium to long term.\u00a0(Exhibit 6)"

The answer lies in ceaseless innovation and highly competent talents.\nInnovation-based success\nOver three decades, Mindray Bio-Medical Electronics Co Ltd grew from an agent for imported medical devices to China's biggest medical solution provider. During this period, it developed cutting-edge technologies, while boosting its core competitiveness and developing the power of its brand.\nMindray takes up a considerable share of the international market with its self-developed products, such as monitors, anesthesia machines and ventilators. The company's direct-selling products have entered two thirds of hospitals in the United States.\nWith an annual revenue over 30 billion yuan ($4.19 billion), Mindray puts over 10 percent of its revenue into innovation and research, which has taken the company's business performance to a higher level. In the first quarter of 2023, Mindray saw both revenue and net profit increase by more than 20 percent.\n\"A great market nurtures good enterprises,\" Mindray's founder Li Xiting said, attributing the company's success to solid innovation-based research and development of products and services to meet the ever-changing market demand.\nThe local government also plays an indispensable role, Li added, noting the policy and capital support that Mindray received in the early stages, as well as the current favorable innovation atmosphere, industrial ecology and business environment in Shenzhen.\nImproving the business environment is one of the priorities of Shenzhen's government work. In recent years, it has strengthened legislation to tackle dishonest business practices and unfair competition, while utilizing AI to reduce administrative intervention, and establishing pilot projects to better protect intellectual property.\nDuring a recent visit to Guangzhou and Shenzhen, Chinese Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing stressed that independent innovation is an inherent requirement for building a powerful manufacturing nation and achieving high-quality development, adding that enterprises should take more responsibility for attaining dominance in innovation.\nZhang said that enterprises should focus on the primary strategic needs of the country and building a modern industrial system, keep an eye on the trend of industrial development and technological changes, strengthen basic research, and continuously optimize the environment for independent innovation.\nYoung and competitive talents\nShenzhen has continued to ramp up efforts to foster innovation with a view to advancing technological development, including setting up research alliances encompassing leading universities and research institutes.\nShenzhen Institute of Advanced Technology was co-founded by the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shenzhen government and the Chinese University of Hong Kong. It specializes in research on health care, robots, new energy and materials, big data and smart cities.\nThe average age of SIAT's 3,219 personnel is 33, while the annual turnover rate stands at 15 percent, ensuring high-level competence and a competitive mechanism.\nAs a result, SIAT has established 230 laboratories jointly with enterprises, while 1,582 businesses have been incubated. Altogether 27.5 percent of scientific and technological achievements have been converted into practical use.\nHuang Shuqiang, SIAT's human resources director, said that the institute applies a system of competition for funding, with a certain rate of elimination applied to the personnel, which stimulates their innovative efforts. Meanwhile, the institute's coordination with enterprises boosts healthy market-driven competition.\nThe relatively high conversion rate is supported by SIAT's innovation and the government's industrial policies, said Fu Xiongfei, SIAT's deputy director.\nHe explained that Shenzhen has mapped out a new model for start-up businesses, namely \"upstairs-downstairs,\" which means accommodating industrial research and incubation inside one complex, making for more efficient innovation and talent integration."

The article reflects the author's opinions, and not necessarily the views of CGTN.\nNo better city represents the miracle of China's rejuvenation over the last four decades than the southern city of Shenzhen, a former fishing village turned into a spectacular and futuristic metropolis where innovation, public services and environmental sustainability are already considered world-class.\nThe key to the development of Shenzhen and its vibrant economy stands in the introduction of the policy of reform and opening-up and in the designation of the city in May 1980. As China's first special economic zone and through the launch of a market-driven scheme that supported the attraction of a large number of foreign investments, the city has become instrumental in making China a prominent player in today's global economy.\nTo celebrate the 40th anniversary of the establishment of the special economic zone and stress the unique role that Shenzhen holds in driving China's growth, Chinese President Xi Jinping is attending\u00a0a commemoration ceremony today. The visit is significant not just because of the anniversary but also because it is happening a few days before the fifth plenum of the Communist Party of China Central Committee in Beijing, where China will chart the economic and political direction for the next five years.\nPresident Xi's trip to Guangdong Province not only marks a tribute to a metropolis that has been able to grow into a global powerhouse at over seven percent per year, becoming the third biggest city in all China behind Shanghai and Beijing, but also represents an opportunity to emphasize China's uninterrupted commitment to further domestic integration and market opening-up to the rest of the world.\nNevertheless, it would be a great mistake to think that the sole purpose of the trip is simply to celebrate the success of a single city. One should not forget that Shenzhen belongs to China's richest, youngest and most educated province, known as the country's economic powerhouse, and that it is also part of the Greater Bay Area (GBA), which is the ambitious national plan to integrate Guangdong Province with the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macao.\nA light show in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, August 26, 2020. /Xinhua\nIn this sense, Macao's Chief Executive Ho Iat Seng and Hong Kong Chief Executive Carry Lam's attendance at the ceremony can be seen as a sign of strategy alignment and further integration between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.\nThe relationship between Hong Kong and Shenzhen, already financially linked through the Stock Connect Program launched in December 2016, represents a well-balanced partnership that combines the comparative advantages of Hong Kong as an international financial hub and provider of capital and Shenzhen as a world leader in technology innovation and home of some of the biggest tech companies in the world.\nIf today China's observers unquestionably consider the country as one of the world's fintech leaders, this can be explained by the central government's strategy of a supportive regulatory framework, its optimal allocation and utilization of national assets, as well as the presence of a vast digital-savvy population and by a deep mismatch between the demand for innovative financial products and the limited solutions provided by traditional financial institutions.\nAt this point, critical voices could argue that it would probably be better to pave the way to a more favorable government policy framework in favor of the ever-growing Shenzhen, considering the increasing importance of technology for national economies in this century and taking into account that last year the city surpassed Hong Kong for the first time in terms of GDP contribution.\nHowever, it is not the government's plan or intention to create a winner-take-all competition within the Greater Bay Area but to create a collective and flourishing region where each city can contribute with its own strengths and where a \"grown-up\" Shenzhen can be the perfect role model for the rest of the country by representing China's determination and visionary approach to achieve its ambitious goals.\nAt a time of post-pandemic recovery, when human-to-human contact has been momentarily suspended, and increasing external pressure from the United States, only through further integration between Shenzhen and the two special administrative regions and continuous opening-up of the domestic market to capitals, talents and trade, will China be able to write a prosperous future for the Greater Bay Area and the rest of the country.\n(If you want to contribute and have specific expertise, please contact us at opinions@cgtn.com)\nCopyright \u00a9 2020 CGTN.

Several supercomputers in the town are expected to pave the way for fintech innovations, including Peng Cheng Cloud Brain jointly forged by Huawei and Peng Cheng Laboratory.\nSimilar to the annual fintech week in Hong Kong and FinTech Festival in Singapore, Shenzhen announced it would organize an annual fintech festival starting this year. As part of the festival, an international competition\uff0dThe FinTechathon\uff0dkicked off this week.\nLiu Guohong, director of the Finance and Modern Industry Research Center at the Shenzhen-based think tank China Development Institute, said Shenzhen has already laid a strong foundation but there is still a gap between it and global fintech hubs such as New York and Singapore.\nMany financial heavyweights have set up their technology subsidiaries in the city, including banks and securities agencies. Shenzhen-based technological behemoths like Tencent and Huawei have invested heavily in related technology platforms. WeBank, China's first private and digital-only bank, was also founded in Shenzhen.\nThe city's advantage is in technical support in software and hardware, with an array of leading technology firms' established platforms. But Liu also pointed out that its weakness is its supervision and talent pool compared to Beijing and Shanghai.\nIn the Global Financial Centres Index jointly published by Z/Yen, a British think tank, and China Development Institute in March, Shenzhen ranked 10th, following Shanghai in fourth and Beijing in eighth.\nIn addition to urging financial institutions to bolster the technology sector, the new government document also emphasizes harnessing technology as a tool to make financial service breakthroughs, he said.\nThe plan encourages financial firms to make full use of technologies, such as big data and artificial intelligence, and to digitalize loan approvals and risk controls. For instance, comprehensive analysis based on data from firms, public services and financial sectors can provide accurate profiles of potential borrowers so that the reliance on collateral can be reduced and information gaps between banks and borrowers narrowed.\nShenzhen HTI Group Co Ltd, a local investment firm for high-tech startups, has established an online fundraising platform to provide loans without traditional collateral requirements.\nZhang Meng, director of risk control in the company's fundraising arm, said they developed an intelligent risk control model based on big data analysis of statistics in business operations, legal departments, tax systems, intellectual property and social credit information.\nAs for supervision, Liu Yang, deputy director of the technology section of the Shenzhen Central Subbranch of the People's Bank of China, said the central bank initiated fintech innovation supervision pilots in 2020 and so far, nine innovative fintech applications are undergoing tests for blockchain, big data, cloud computer and AI technologies."
