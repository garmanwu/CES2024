        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Columbus (OH) 2024\nTecci\u014d.science\nOur vision for sleep.Dynamic.\nWhat we do.Impact Sleep.\nThe manufacturer integrates Tecci\u014d modules into the mattress or bed.\nThese modules change the firmness of the bed during sleep. Software driven.\nChanges are so smooth \u2013 the user does not even notice them.\nSoftware running as a smartphone app controls the modules. This app uses proprietary algorithms and real time sensor data.\nTargeted firmness changes based on these algorithms affect sleep.\nThis is Tecci\u014d.\nFirmness changes during the night:\nGood Night.\nGood Morning.\nFirmness change.\nSmooth.\nTecci\u014d uses dynamic foams that change their firmness anytime based on thermodynamic properties.\u00a0No pumps or motors are needed as the foam itself becomes soft or firm.\nAn app determines the required firmness based on data \u2013 from manual input or from sensors. Tecci\u014d algorithms are used to calculate the best firmness \u2013 anytime, real-time, overnight.\nWe were surprised to discover how sleep is affected by firmness changes overnight. Research discovers new Tecci\u014d use cases frequently.\nA love story:\nThe mattress\nmeets\u00a0its software.\nFinally, a product designer can combine a mattress with intelligent software.\nSleep is increasingly important for consumers. The introduction of sleep-measuring devices like smart watches or sensors made that possible. These devices demonstrate that sleep is a complex pattern of biological functions \u2013 not just a \u2018black box of time being unconscious\u2019.\nEven a normal night can be more or less effective for recovery. Users feel the difference if they wake up in deep sleep or do not get enough REM- or deep sleep. They also realize how often they wake up during a single night.\u00a0With Tecci\u014d a product designer can finally combine a mattress with intelligent software to change this.\nYou as the manufacturer can accompany your customer through the lifetime of the bed or mattress -making a new relationship possible. Welcome to the digital world!\nA bed waking up.\nYou.\nGet a glimpse at some of our fascinating use cases:\nSmart wake up\nChoose! Smart-wake-up apps are very popular, waking you up while not in deep sleep, but that`s often too early.\nA mattress\u00a0using Tecci\u014d prevents you from having deep sleep at your favourite wake up time, thanks to our algorithms.\nErgonomics for Millenials\u2026\nYes, you heard it before. You should have a firm surface to support your spine. But you like to have it soft and comfortable. Just a click away\u2026 Tell the bed to be soft when going to bed and at wake up \u2013 but firm and supporting in the middle of the night. Done!\nWeekend? Yes!\nWork hard. Play hard. Your nights are very different. You are used to get up early during the week, but what about weekends? Relax. And sleep in. Does your bed know that too? A Tecci\u014d bed adapts to the day of the week \u2013 and impacts your sleep accordingly.\nWho we are.\n\u201eBecause Science Matters\u201c\nThis\u00a0is true everywhere and also in research for comfort products. And everything is becoming digital nowadays. We at Variowell Development believe in both \u2018science\u2019 and \u2018digital\u2019.\nWe apply modern digital scientific tools and methods to products which are developed in a very traditional way normally. We do not accept anything as given. In doing this we have collected an extensive portfolio of IP-rights, patents and \u2013 most important \u2013 Know How.Our team members are regularly in Silicon Valley participating in industry relating events.

        "raw_content": "Exclusive Pepaminto topper wins CES\u00ae 2023 Innovation Award\nMattress Topper developed exclusively for the Apple Watch\u00ae.\nM\u00dcNSTER, Germany, Jan. 3, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Freezing, shivering, sweating - everyone's nighttime perception of warmth is different. The German Start-up Variowell Development asked 3.300 consumers in 5 countries globally. Over 50% answered that they or their partner often feel too hot often at night - male and female consumers alike. Interesting fact: Over 30% react by sticking a foot outside of the bed. But most consumers are just increasing the air conditioning \u2013not great for the environment. One thing is certain: body temperature, Heart rate and blood flow change regularly during the night. It is therefore not uncommon to sweat during sleep and at the same time feel cold at the feet. The topper from the German company Variowell Development GmbH is ideal to deal with this common topic. \"With Pepaminto for the first time it has been possible to easily implement different thermal settings in a bed during the night by adapting the heat dissipation within the foam,\" explains Variowell CEO Tobias Kirchhoff.\nThe idea behind the technology, which has just been won the CES\u00ae 2023 Innovation Award in the category digital health, is a combination of thin warming-strips and naturally cooling bands of graphite. The cooling properties were tested in the company's own sleep lab and independently verified by the renowned Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology - Empa for short. Together with the warming-strips the heat dissipation and therefore temperature in the feet and lumbar section can be changed subtly also during the night. To improve the sleep experience Variowell is using the capabilities of the Apple Watch. \"Test users were surprised how easy to use the topper can be adapted to the thermal reception of the user,\" Tobias continues. All settings are changed using the Digital Crown of the Apple Watch\u00ae. The Topper automatically detects when a person is sleeping. The Topper is connected to a standard USB-C charger as it requires only low-voltage power.\nThe Sensors of the Apple Watch were integrated as well. \"Our constantly changing body temperature affects our perception of warmth during sleep, and thus the quality of our sleep experience,\" the CEO continued. Pepaminto analyses this via the heart rate and adjusts the temperature accordingly. The different body zones - such as foot and lumbar areas - are automatically taken into account. And besides these impressing functionalities important data of the sleeping-room air quality are measured and the user is informed of any unusual value changes. Therefore, the Pepaminto is a great combination of \"Smart Home\" and \"Smart Health\". To realize this product Variowell Development teamed up with Bosch Global Software Technologies which were convinced by the state-of-the-art product concept of Pepaminto.\nThe topper \"made in Germany\" will be presented at the influential technology event CES\u00ae in Las Vegas, USA, from January 5 to 8. In the section Digital Health, Pepaminto has just won the prestigious CES Innovation Award, presented by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)\u00ae. This annual competition recognizes outstanding design and engineering in 28 consumer technology product categories. The products submitted are judged by a distinguished panel of industry experts, including media representatives, designers, engineers and others, based on innovation, technology and functionality, as well as aesthetics and design. Following the launch at CES\u00ae, Pepaminto will initially be introduced in two test markets, the UK and Switzerland. The launch in further markets will follow in 2023.\nWebsite for the product: www.pepaminto.com\nNote for journalists:Variowell Development GmbH will present Pepaminto at a press conference on January 5th, 2023 from 12:00n to 12:30p PST in the Venetian Lido 3105, with support from the sleep scientist Roy Rayman (Sleepczar) and Digent Shah (Vice President Software and Digital Solutions from BOSCH Global Software Technologies). The team will be available for interviews and questions afterwards.\nAbout Variowell Development GmbHThe German company Variowell develops and markets intelligent technologies for the mattress industry.

M\u00dcNSTER, Germany, Jan. 3, 2023 /PRNewswire/ \u2014 Freezing, shivering, sweating \u2013 everyone\u2019s nighttime perception of warmth is different. The German Start-up Variowell Development asked 3.300 consumers in 5 countries globally. Over 50% answered that they or their partner often feel too hot often at night \u2013 male and female consumers alike. Interesting fact: Over 30% react by sticking a foot outside of the bed. But most consumers are just increasing the air conditioning \u2013not great for the environment. One thing is certain: body temperature, Heart rate and blood flow change regularly during the night. It is therefore not uncommon to sweat during sleep and at the same time feel cold at the feet. The topper from the German company Variowell Development GmbH is ideal to deal with this common topic. \u201cWith Pepaminto for the first time it has been possible to easily implement different thermal settings in a bed during the night by adapting the heat dissipation within the foam,\u201d explains Variowell CEO Tobias Kirchhoff. The idea behind the technology, which has just been won the CES\u00ae 2023 Innovation Award in the category digital health, is a combination of thin warming-strips and naturally cooling bands of graphite. The cooling properties were tested in the company\u2019s own sleep lab and independently verified by the renowned Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology \u2013 Empa for short. Together with the warming-strips the heat dissipation and therefore temperature in the feet and lumbar section can be changed subtly also during the night. To improve the sleep experience Variowell is using the capabilities of the Apple Watch. \u201cTest users were surprised how easy to use the topper can be adapted to the thermal reception of the user,\u201d Tobias continues. All settings are changed using the Digital Crown of the Apple Watch\u00ae. The Topper automatically detects when a person is sleeping. The Topper is connected to a standard USB-C charger as it requires only low-voltage power. The Sensors of the Apple Watch were integrated as well. \u201cOur constantly changing body temperature affects our perception of warmth during sleep, and thus the quality of our sleep experience,\u201d the CEO continued. Pepaminto analyses this via the heart rate and adjusts the temperature accordingly. The different body zones \u2013 such as foot and lumbar areas \u2013 are automatically taken into account. And besides these impressing functionalities important data of the sleeping-room air quality are measured and the user is informed of any unusual value changes. Therefore, the Pepaminto is a great combination of \u201cSmart Home\u201d and \u201cSmart Health\u201d. To realize this product Variowell Development teamed up with Bosch Global Software Technologies which were convinced by the state-of-the-art product concept of Pepaminto. - Advertisement -\nThe topper \u201cmade in Germany\u201d will be presented at the influential technology event CES\u00ae in Las Vegas, USA, from January 5 to 8.
