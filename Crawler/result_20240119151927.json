Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

The Group is making a binding commitment to take action now to ensure a lower-carbon digital environment.\nAI and data-driven systems have both positive and negative environmental impacts. While AI helps to reduce energy consumption (through optimisation of air and ground transport, smart city applications, etc.), it also consumes large quantities of energy during production and use, just like any other electronic system. Thales researchers are working on a four-pronged approach to make artificial intelligence more eco-responsible:\nSustainable procurement\nThe Procurement Department plays a key role in meeting the challenges of climate change. Thales is committed to gaining a better understanding of the carbon footprint of those suppliers whose products or services generate the highest emission levels.\nOur Sustainable Procurement policy, focused on value creation, innovation, business partnerships and operational excellence, aims to give Thales a lasting competitive advantage at global level.\nThe policy has six key priorities:\nClick the button to find out more about Thales's commitments on sustainable procurement.\nIn 2021, a \u201cLow Carbon\u201d questionnaire was sent out to more than 100 suppliers in the purchasing categories identified as having the highest greenhouse gas emissions. The questionnaire is used to measure suppliers\u2019 maturity based on communication of their own carbon footprint and their reduction strategy. Initial responses from the suppliers surveyed show a growing commitment to this issue.\nAlso in 2021, the Procurement Department launched pilot tender processes for air travel, short and long-term car rentals and packaging that included weighted selection criteria relating to reductions in the carbon footprint of the goods and services purchased, and to respect for the environment. When entering into the relevant purchasing contracts, suppliers will be required to commit to quantified and milestone based emissions reduction targets.\nIn 2021, Thales received the Supplier relations and Sustainable procurement certification, which rewards companies for maintaining balanced and sustainable relationships with their suppliers. Official certification is a welcome reminder of the crucial role that procurement plays in Thales's corporate social responsibility policy.\nFurther more\n.\nSocial networks\nContact us\nThales Headquarters\n+33 (0) 1 57 77 80 00"

The NPRM published in the\nFederal Register\non August 24, 2023 (88 FR 57904). The NPRM was prompted by AD 2022\u20130024, dated February 4, 2022, issued by the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), which is the Technical Agent for the Member States of the European Union (referred to after this as the MCAI). The MCAI states that Thales FMC2 NAVM, P/N C13084CA03, provides erroneous guidance for navigation procedures of the flight management system due to issues with the software. This condition, if not addressed, could compromise the safety margins of the airplane. To address the unsafe condition, the MCAI requires revising the AFM with operational instructions for the affected airborne navigation procedures of the AFM. The MCAI also requires updating the navigation database software, and prohibits installing a database for the Thales FMC2 NAVM, P/N C13084CA03, unless it does not include the procedures specified in section II of Thales Service Information Letter F9111\u2013J70859DN\u201300, issued January 18, 2022 (Thales SIL F9111\u2013J70859DN\u201300).\nIn the NPRM, the FAA proposed to require revising the existing AFM for your airplane and updating the navigation database. The FAA also proposed to prohibit installing a database unless certain procedures were not included. The FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products.\nYou may examine the MCAI in the AD docket at\nregulations.gov\nunder Docket No. FAA\u20132023\u20131716.\nDiscussion of Final Airworthiness Directive\nComments\nThe FAA received no comments on the NPRM or on the determination of the costs.\nConclusion\nThese products have been approved by the aviation authority of another country and are approved for operation in the United States. Pursuant to the FAA's bilateral agreement with this State of Design Authority, it has notified the FAA of the unsafe condition described in the MCAI referenced above. The FAA reviewed the relevant data and determined that air safety requires adopting this AD as proposed. Accordingly, the FAA is issuing this AD to address the unsafe condition on these products. This AD is adopted as proposed in the NPRM.\nRelated Service Information Under 1 CFR Part 51\nThe FAA reviewed Thales SIL F9111\u2013J70859DN\u201300. This service information specifies updating the Thales FMC2 NAVM, P/N C13084CA03, navigation database.\nThis service information is reasonably available because the interested parties have access to it through their normal course of business or by the means identified in\nADDRESSES\n.\nDifferences Between This AD and the MCAI\nThe MCAI applies to all Thales FMC2 NAVMs, P/N C13084CA03, installed on, but not limited to Dassault (formerly Br\u00e9guet) Br.1150 Atlantique 2 (ATL2) maritime patrol airplanes, and this AD does not apply to those airplanes because those airplanes do not have an FAA type certificate. Currently, no airplanes on the U.S. registry incorporate the navigation equipment affected by this AD.\nCosts of Compliance\nThere are currently no affected airplanes on the U.S. registry with a Thales FMC2 NAVM, P/N C13084CA03, installed. In the event a U.S.-registered airplane would have this equipment installed, the following is an estimate of the costs to comply with this AD.\nEstimated Costs\nAuthority for This Rulemaking\nTitle 49 of the United States Code specifies the FAA's authority to issue rules on aviation safety. Subtitle I, section 106, describes the authority of the FAA Administrator. Subtitle VII: Aviation Programs, describes in more detail the scope of the Agency's authority.\nThe FAA is issuing this rulemaking under the authority described in Subtitle VII, Part A, Subpart III, Section 44701: General requirements. Under that section, Congress charges the FAA with promoting safe flight of civil aircraft in air commerce by prescribing regulations for practices, methods, and procedures the Administrator finds necessary for safety in air commerce. This regulation is within the scope of that authority because it addresses an unsafe condition that is likely to exist or develop on products identified in this rulemaking action.\nRegulatory Findings\nThis AD will not have federalism implications under Executive Order 13132. This AD will not have a substantial direct effect on the States, on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government.\nFor the reasons discussed above, I certify that this AD:\nStart Printed Page 76654\n(1) Is not a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d under Executive Order 12866,\n(2) Will not affect intrastate aviation in Alaska, and\n(3) Will not have a significant economic impact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act.\nList of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39\nThe Amendment\nAccordingly, under the authority delegated to me by the Administrator, the FAA amends 14 CFR part 39 as follows:\nPART 39\u2014AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES\n1. The authority citation for part 39 continues to read as follows:\nAuthority:\n49 U.S.C. 106(g), 40113, 44701.\n2. The FAA amends \u00a7\u200939.13 by adding the following new airworthiness directive:\n2023\u201321\u201305\u2003Thales AVS France SAS:\nAmendment 39\u201322577; Docket No. FAA\u20132023\u20131716; Project Identifier MCAI\u20132022\u201300168\u2013Q.\n(a) Effective Date\nThis airworthiness directive (AD) is effective December 12, 2023.\n(b) Affected ADs\nNone.\n(c) Applicability\nThis AD applies to Thales AVS France SAS flight management computer navigation modules (FMC2 NAVM), part number (P/N) C13084CA03, installed on, but not limited to airplanes, certificated in any category.\n(d) Subject\nJoint Aircraft System Component (JASC) Code 3400, Navigation System.\n(e) Unsafe Condition\nThis AD was prompted by reports that, due to software issues, certain FMC2 NAVM navigation modules provide erroneous data to the flight management computer, compromising safe flight of the airplane. This condition, if not addressed, could compromise the safety margins of the airplane and result in controlled flight into terrain.\n(f) Compliance\nComply with this AD within the compliance times specified, unless already done.\n(g) Required Actions\n(1) Within 30 days after the effective date of this AD, revise the Limitations Section of the existing airplane flight manual (AFM) for your airplane by adding the information in Table 1 to the introductory text of paragraph (g)(1) of this AD and Table 2 to the introductory text of paragraph (g)(1) of this AD.\nTable 1 to the Introductory Text of Paragraph (\ng\n)(1)\u2014 Limitations To Operate the Flight Management System (FMS) of the Airplane\n[Formulated as instructions to the Flight Crew]\nTable 2 to the Introductory Text of Paragraph (\ng\n)(1)\u2014FMS User Manual Limitations\n(i) Inserting a copy of this AD into the Limitations Section of the existing AFM for your airplane satisfies the requirement of the introductory text of paragraph (g)(1) of this AD.\n(ii) The actions required by the introductory text of paragraph (g)(1) of this AD may be performed by the owner/operator (pilot) holding at least a private pilot certificate and must be entered into the aircraft records showing compliance with this AD in accordance with 14 CFR 43.9(a) and 91.417(a)(2)(v).

Built slowly and with careful planning, the Group boasts remarkable cohesion and strength, and has often proven its ability to adapt its structures to prevailing conditions. Here are some of the highlights from the story so far...\nThe professional electronics businesses of Thomson-Brandt (previously CFTH) merge with Compagnie G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de T\u00e9l\u00e9graphie Sans Fil (CSF) to form Thomson-CSF. Compagnie Fran\u00e7aise Thomson-Houston (CFTH) was formed in 1893 to operate the patents of the US Thomson-Houston Electric Corp. in the emerging market for power generation and transmission. CSF was founded in 1918 and became a pioneer in broadcasting. With its subsidiary Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise Radio\u00e9lectrique (SFR), acquired in 1957, CSF was a key player in the 1930s development of broadcasting, short wave, electro-acoustics and early radar and television systems.\nThe company receives its first major export contracts in the Middle East, after the 1973 and 1979 oil crises. It diversifies into telephone switchgear, silicon semiconductors and medical imaging (CGR).\nSTRATEGIC REFOCUSING ON PROFESSIONAL AND DEFENCE ELECTRONICS\nPRIVATISATION\nFROM THOMSON-CSF TO THALES\nAfter privatisation, the Group's \"multi-domestic\" strategy in defence markets is pursued throughout the 1990s in Europe, and then extended to South Africa, Australia, South Korea and Singapore. After the friendly takeover in June 2000 of the British company Racal Electronics, the United Kingdom becomes the Group's second-largest \"domestic\" industrial base. Its defence, information technology and services businesses are expanded.\nThese acquisitions as well as internal growth radically alter the Group's portfolio of businesses. A strategic review stresses the increasing importance of civil applications, particularly mobile telecommunications. In line with this strategic focus, a new organisation with three business areas - defence, aerospace and information technology and services (IT&S) - is introduced in July\nThe new structure is designed above all to leverage the Group's \"dual technology\" expertise, focus its strategic development in civil markets on businesses with real synergies with the Group's proven defence and aerospace competencies, and enable the Group to gain leadership positions in those markets. Not all its civil businesses meet these criteria, and the Group embarks on a programme of divestment of non-strategic assets.\nIn December 2000, Thomson-CSF, recently renamed Thales, forms the first transatlantic joint venture in the defence sector, and the world leader in air defence, with the American company Raytheon.\nFROM BUSINESS AREAS TO DIVISIONS: SECURITY, A THALES CORE BUSINESS\nResponding to the geopolitical and economic upheavals following 11 September 2001, Thales strengthens its focus on the most technology-intensive segments of the defence market, particularly networkcentric warfare and force interoperability. At the same time, it expands its role as prime contractor and service provider to meet the needs of client countries faced with the growing complexity of programmes and the increasing sophistication of defence equipment and systems.\nThales pursues its \"multi-domestic\" development policy, acquires full control of several defence and aerospace subsidiaries originally held through joint ventures. Thales UK, now Britain's second-largest defence contractor, is selected for a number of major Ministry of Defence programmes, including the CVF future aircraft carriers.\nThe Group continues to divest non-strategic civil businesses and to consolidate and structure its capabilities in the expanding civil security market, particularly through its Thales SHIELD initiative.\nIn 2004, with refocusing of the civil businesses almost complete, Thales announces a new organisation based on six divisions, each defined according to its respective markets, to facilitate implementation of common technologies.\nA new chapter\n2007\u00a0saw the opening of a new chapter in Thales's history, with the transfer of transport, security and space activities from longstanding partner Alcatel-Lucent. The New Thales is bigger and stronger than before with increased revenues, more employees and the arrival of new and complementary skills, making Thales a major world player with exceptional technological capabilities and leader in mission-critical information systems serving three markets: Defence, Aerospace, and Security.\nIn 2007, Thales also signed an agreement with French naval player DCNS, enabling Thales to gain a 25% stake in the company and become its industry stakeholder-partner. This alliance strengthens and secures Thales's naval credentials both on key European programme and on a number of major export contracts.\nIn 2009, Dassault Aviation acquired Alcatel-Lucent's stake in Thales and is now the Group's main private shareholder and industry partner. With a newly stable shareholder base, Thales is opening a new page in its history.\nThe Group\u2019s firmly-rooted strategy is reflected in its presence along the \"value chain\" from equipment and systems to systems integration, prime contracting and services), a balanced portfolio between dual defence and civil technologies and businesses, and a multidomestic presence as a local player on local markets.\nThe new Thales\nDigital identity and security are crucial to every aspect of the interconnected world we live in. At every stage in our customers\u2019 critical digital decision chain, the identity and authenticity of users must be verified with the appropriate level of assurance, almost instantaneously. The acquisition of Gemalto in 2019, a world-renowned, international digital security company serving businesses and governments in more than 180 countries, positions Thales to be a world leader in digital security.\nA Purpose\nThales formally defines its Purpose \u2013 \"Building a future we can all trust\" \u2013 that expresses what the Group brings to all its stakeholders and, beyond that, to society as a whole. The relevance and authenticity of this purpose was put to the test during the COVID-19 pandemic during which the Group demonstrated, once again, tremendous resilience, due in particular to the diversity of its activities.\n.\nSocial networks\nContact us\nThales Headquarters\n+33 (0) 1 57 77 80 00"
