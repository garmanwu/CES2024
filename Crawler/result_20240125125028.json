For example, in the pharmaceutical process of biologics drugs, a cell line development process is required for most biopharmaceuticals. However, the cell line development is a complicated, labor-intensive, and pricey process.\nThe main reason is that the early-stage culture environment is limited to static culture in 96/24 well plate, which is not an ideal environment for cell lines, and the oxygen supply is often under constraints. These cause the cell lines to exhibit different characteristics with later-stage of bioreactor culture and affect the development schedule.\nTo optimize and tackle the challenges at hand, cytenaBPS developed a novel microbioreactor \u2013\nc.bird\u2122 based on its patented microfluidic technology.\nC.bird\u2122 is a high throughput microbioreactor for parallel cultivations in 96 well plates capable of bringing production bioreactor condition to the 150 to 1400 \u00b5L scale. Compared to the traditional methods, c.bird\u2122 provides stability while maintaining the vitality of cells, potentially changing the way biopharmaceuticals used to screen, and further become a new alternative for large-scale bioreactors. c.bird\u2122 speeds up the manufacturing process, bringing an edge to large pharmaceutical companies and research organizations.\n\u201cWith this capital injection, we can accelerate the development of the next generation of microbioreactor. Lots of top pharmaceutical companies are looking forward to integrating it into their current workflow, and they already signed and booked as the early-beta user. We expect to ship the devices and have their feedback Q1-Q2 next year.\u201d said Charels Tsai, CEO and founder of cytenaBPS\nThe c.bird\u2122 entered the markets in the US, Europe, China, Japan, and Taiwan from July and signed the memorandum of understanding (MOU) with AstraZeneca, pushing forth the technology in new fields of cell line culture.\nCytenaBPS CFO Elbert Chen said, \u201ccytenaBPS will team up with its international strategic partners cytena GmbH/Cellink AB to showcase products on a global scale. As for the market and research strategy in Taiwan, cytenaBPS plans to recruit more local talents and integrate R&D resources with Taiwan Startup Terrace. The goal is to design new technologies and products for the biotech market.\u201d\ncytenaBPS is expanding its business in Taiwan and looking for partners and both medical, microfluidic engineering talents.
