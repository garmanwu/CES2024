Such a complete environment empowers the users to easily leverage NDP (Near Data Processing) technology. The evaluation result showed that DockerSSD accelerates the execution by 2x and reduces the power consumption by 2x.\nNDP technology has been discussed for decades as a solution to accelerate data processing by minimizing data movement. To leverage the advantage of NDP, there were numerous approaches from memory/storage vendors. However, these approaches have not been widely deployed due to their poor usability. This is because the vendors did not want their internal hardware and software disclosed. Instead, they have provided their internal environments through different interfaces, forcing applications to be modified to fit these interfaces.\nTo enhance the usability of NDP technology, Panmnesia has developed DockerSSD, a new way of NDP that employs Docker inside the storage device. Docker is an operating system-level virtualization software that provides all the necessary environments for user applications running on the operating system. By leveraging Docker, DockerSSD can implement an environment used in a host within the storage device. This allows users to run their application in storage, without being bounded by vendor-specific interfaces. Since this work relieves a significant burden on the users while providing high performance and high energy efficiency, Panmnesia expects this work to be widely adopted in growing data centers.\nThe paper will be presented in March at \u2018IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture, (HPCA) 2024\u2019 held in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nPanmnesia Wins CES 2024 Innovation Award for Its CXL Technology on AI Accelerator\nPanmensia, a CXL Intellectual Property (IP) leader, announced that it has been bestowed with the CES 2024 Innovation Award for its pioneering CXL-enabled AI accelerator.

Panmnesia has built its AI accelerator device on Compute Express Link (CXL) 3.0 technology, which allows an external memory pool to be shared with host computers, and components like the CPU, which can translate to near-limitless memory capacity. This is thanks to the incorporation of a CXL 3.0 controller into the accelerator chip. CXL is used to connect system devices \u2013 including accelerators, memory expanders, processors, and switches. By linking up multiple accelerators and memory expanders using CXL switches, the technology can provide enough memory to an intensive system for AI applications. What CXL 3.0 means for LLMs\nThe use of CXL 2.0 in devices like this would allow particular hosts access to their dedicated portion of pooled external memory, while the latest generation allows hosts to access the entire pool as and when needed. \u201cWe believe that our CXL technology will be a cornerstone for next-generation AI acceleration system,\" said Panmesia founder and CEO Myoungsoo Jung in a statement . \"We remain committed to our endeavor revolutionizing not only for AI acceleration system, but also other general-purpose environments such as data centers, cloud computing, and high-performance computing.\u201d\nPanmnesia's technology works akin to how clusters of servers may share external SSDs to store data, and would be particularly useful for servers because they'll often need to access more data that they can hold in the memory that's in-built. This device is built specifically for large-scale AI applications \u2013 and its creators claim it's 101 times faster at performing AI-based search functions than conventional services, which use SSDs to store data, linked via networks.

        "raw_content": "Panmnesia successfully hosted \u2018CXL Tech Day 2024\u2019 on January 19th in Daejeon, South Korea, drawing an audience of around a hundred students and reporters who are interested in semiconductor technology.\nDuring the event, leading engineers in the field of Compute Express Link (CXL) discovered the significance of CXL, delved into the distinctions of CXL 3.0 compared to its predecessors, and explored how CXL technology can revolutionize datacenter architecture.\nThe engineers also shared cutting-edge technologies and research topics related to CXL. Notable presentations included Miryeong Kwon, Chief Strategy Officer (CSO) of Panmnesia, elucidating Panmnesia\u2019s AI acceleration framework built upon the CXL Type2 device. Hanjin Choi, Assistant Director of Panmnesia, unveiled the company\u2019s solution to accelerate practical supercomputing applications which is based on CXL 3.0/3.1 hardware framework. Lastly, Seonghyeon Jang, Assistant Director of Panmnesia, introduced Panmnesia\u2019s cost-efficient, petabyte-scale memory expansion solution based on CXL-SSD technology.\nAdditionally, Myoungsoo Jung, CEO of Panmnesia, highlighted the recent accomplishments of the company and outlined plans for the new year.\nNoteworthy among the reported achievements was Panmnesia\u2019s active engagement in collaborations and discussions with over twenty global IT companies.\nThe company is poised to expand its business model and expedite recruitment initiatives, leveraging the strategic positioning of their new offices in both Daejeon and Seoul.\nThis event has garnered attention from reputable Korean publications. For those interested, additional details can be found in the articles (link below).\nPanmnesia has developed DockerSSD, a technology that allows storage devices to be utilized as independent server that processes data without computer.\nThe DockerSSD employs Docker, a widely used operating system-level virtualization software, to provide a complete environment for executing user-level applications. Such a complete environment empowers the users to easily leverage NDP (Near Data Processing) technology. The evaluation result showed that DockerSSD accelerates the execution by 2x and reduces the power consumption by 2x.\nNDP technology has been discussed for decades as a solution to accelerate data processing by minimizing data movement. To leverage the advantage of NDP, there were numerous approaches from memory/storage vendors. However, these approaches have not been widely deployed due to their poor usability. This is because the vendors did not want their internal hardware and software disclosed. Instead, they have provided their internal environments through different interfaces, forcing applications to be modified to fit these interfaces.\nTo enhance the usability of NDP technology, Panmnesia has developed DockerSSD, a new way of NDP that employs Docker inside the storage device. Docker is an operating system-level virtualization software that provides all the necessary environments for user applications running on the operating system. By leveraging Docker, DockerSSD can implement an environment used in a host within the storage device. This allows users to run their application in storage, without being bounded by vendor-specific interfaces. Since this work relieves a significant burden on the users while providing high performance and high energy efficiency, Panmnesia expects this work to be widely adopted in growing data centers.\nThe paper will be presented in March at \u2018IEEE International Symposium on High Performance Computer Architecture, (HPCA) 2024\u2019 held in Edinburgh, Scotland.\nPanmensia, a CXL Intellectual Property (IP) leader, announced that it has been bestowed with the CES 2024 Innovation Award for its pioneering CXL-enabled AI accelerator.

The paper, which will soon be available in IEEE Micro Magazine, introduces several innovative techniques that make training fault-tolerant with low overhead.\nTrainingCXL integrates persistent memory (PMEM) and GPU into a cache-coherent domain as Type 2, which enables PMEM to be directly placed in GPU\u2019s memory hierarchy, allowing GPU to access PMEM without software intervention. The solution introduces computing and checkpointing logic near the CXL controller, thereby actively managing persistency and training data. Considering PMEM\u2019s vulnerability, TrainingCXL utilizes the unique characteristics of recommendation models and takes the checkpointing overhead off the critical path of their training. Lastly, the solution employs an advanced checkpointing technique that relaxes the updating sequence of model parameters and embeddings across training batches.\nThe evaluation of TrainingCXL shows that it achieves a remarkable 5.2x training performance improvement and 76% energy savings, compared to modern PMEM-based recommendation systems. These results demonstrate the potential of TrainingCXL to revolutionize the field of large-scale recommendation datasets by providing a more efficient, cost-effective, and fault-tolerant solution.\nWe are proud to have developed this innovative solution and excited to share it with the community.

While hyperscalers and cloud builders have been the early adopters of this technology, high-performance computing (HPC) centers are also starting to show interest.\nThe Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) has been working on a promising solution called DirectCXL, which enables memory disaggregation and composition using the CXL 2.0 protocol atop the PCI-Express bus and a PCI-Express switching complex. Recently, DirectCXL was showcased in a paper presented at the USENIX Annual Technical Conference and discussed in a brochure and a short video.\nThis solution promises to revolutionize the field of HPC, offering practical and cost-effective solutions for memory expansion. DirectCXL utilizes the Transparent Page Placement protocol and Chameleon memory tracking to create tiered, disaggregated, and composable main memory for systems, similar to other projects like Meta Platforms\u2019 Transparent Page Placement protocol and Microsoft\u2019s zNUMA memory project.\nWe are pleased to announce that Panmnesia, Inc has acquired the intellectual property rights for DirectCXL from KAIST. As a company, we are excited to see the progress being made in the field of memory disaggregation and composition, particularly in the HPC space. We believe that CXL has the potential to drive innovation and progress in CPU and memory technology, and we are committed to leveraging this technology to create groundbreaking solutions for our customers.\nStay tuned for more updates and developments as we continue to explore the potential of CXL and DirectCXL.\nWe are proud to announce that our cutting-edge Compute Express Link (CXL) based solid-state drives (CXL-SSD) have been successfully demonstrated at the 2022 ACM Workshop on Hot Topics in Storage and File Systems (HotStorage\u201922). The workshop, which focuses on research and developments in storage systems, was a perfect opportunity to showcase the innovative capabilities of our CXL-SSD.\nCXL is an open multi-protocol method that supports cache coherent interconnect for various processors, accelerators, and memory device types. While it primarily manages data coherency between CPU memory spaces and memory on attached devices, we believe that it can also be useful in transforming existing block storage into cost-efficient, large-scale working memory.\nOur presentation at HotStorage\u201922 examined three different sub-protocols of CXL from a memory expander viewpoint. We suggested the device type that can be the best option for PCIe storage to bridge its block semantics to memory-compatible, byte semantics. Additionally, we discussed how to integrate a storage-integrated memory expander into an existing system and speculated on its impact on system performance. Lastly, we explored various CXL network topologies and the potential of a new opportunity to efficiently manage the storage-integrated, CXL-based memory expansion.\nOur demonstration at HotStorage\u201922 highlighted the significant advancements in CXL technology and how it can transform storage and memory systems.

Our CXL-SSD is just one example of the groundbreaking solutions that we are creating to meet the needs of our customers. We believe that CXL is the future of CPU and memory technology, and we are excited to be at the forefront of this exciting new frontier.\nStay tuned for more updates as we continue to explore the potential of CXL technology and its impact on storage and memory systems.\nWe are thrilled to share that our team has successfully proposed and demonstrated a new cache coherent interconnect called DirectCXL, which directly connects a host processor complex and remote memory resources over CXL\u2019s memory protocol (CXL.mem). In a paper published in USENIX ATC, we explore several practical designs for CXL-based memory disaggregation and make them real, offering a new approach to utilizing memory resources that is expected to be more efficient than ever before.\nDirectCXL eliminates the need for data copies between the host memory and remote memory, which allows for the true performance of remote-side disaggregated memory resources to be exposed to the users. Additionally, we have created a CXL software runtime that enables users to utilize the underlying disaggregated memory resources through sheer load/store instructions, as there is no operating system currently supporting CXL.\nOur work has been recognized with an acceptance rate of only 16% at USENIX ATC, a testament to the significance of our proposal and its potential impact on the industry. We are excited to continue our research and development in this area and look forward to sharing more updates in the near future.\nNews (Korean):\nAs the big data era arrives and data-intensive workloads continue to proliferate, resource disaggregation has become an increasingly important area of research and development. By separating processors and storage devices from one another, disaggregated resource architectures can offer greater scale-out capabilities, increased cost efficiency, and transparent elasticity, breaking down the physical boundaries that have traditionally constrained data center and high-performance computing environments.\nHowever, achieving memory disaggregation that supports high performance and scalability with low cost is a non-trivial task. Many industry prototypes and academic studies have explored a wide range of approaches to realize memory disaggregation, but to date, the concept has yet to be fully realized due to several fundamental challenges.\nThat\u2019s where our team at Panmnesia (KAIST startup) comes in. We have developed a world-first proof-of-concept CXL solution that directly connects a host processor complex and remote memory resources over the computing express link (CXL) protocol. Our solution framework includes a set of CXL hardware and software IPs, such as a CXL switch, processor complex IP, and CXL memory controller, which completely decouple memory resources from computing resources and enable high-performance, fully scale-out memory disaggregation architectures.\nOur CXL solution framework provides several key benefits over traditional memory disaggregation approaches. For example, it enables greater resource utilization and efficiency by making it possible to more easily share and allocate memory resources across multiple nodes. Additionally, our framework can support greater scalability, allowing organizations to expand their memory resources as their needs grow without incurring significant costs or disruptions.\nOverall, we believe that our CXL solution represents a major breakthrough in the field of resource disaggregation and memory disaggregation in particular. By providing a more efficient, cost-effective, and scalable approach to memory disaggregation, we are helping organizations to fully leverage the power of their data-intensive workloads and realize the full potential of their computing environments.\nNews (Korean):\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 Panmnesia.

        "raw_content": "Panmnesia intros CXL 3.0-enabled memory sharing AI accelerator\nKorean technology firm Panmnesia has a CXL 3.0-enabled accelerator chip which provides sharable memory to speed AI applications.\nCXL (Computer eXpress Link) 3.0 enables a pool of external memory, accessed through CXL switches, to be shared between host computers with coherent caches in the hosts and the CXL memory endpoints or expanders. The earlier CXL 2.0 standard enabled hosts to access their part of an external memory pool via a CXL switch but not share it. The initial CXL 1.0/1.1 standards supported a host having direct access to external memory without going through a switch.\nThe forthcoming CES 2024 show has given Panmnesia an Innovation Award for its accelerator chip.\nPanmnesia founder and CEO Myoungsoo Jung said in a statement: \u201cWe believe that our CXL technology will be a cornerstone for next-generation AI acceleration system. We remain committed to our endeavor revolutionizing not only for AI acceleration system, but also other general-purpose environments such as data centers, cloud computing, and high-performance computing.\u201d\nThe company contrasts its ability to provide up to a theoretical 4PB of shared memory with clustered servers accessing external SSDs for data. It says that individual servers generally work in parallel on AI and other HPC-style applications and need to access more data than can be held in their memory. That means they have to use SSDs to store the excess data and access them by SAS, NVMe or RDMA protocols across a network.\nIt is better \u2013 faster \u2013 to load all the data into an external memory pool and have all the servers access it using memory load and store instructions with data crossing a PCIe 6 bus instead of a slower network link.\nThe accelerator chip is part of a Panmnesia All-in-One Framework to help developers build proof-of-concept CXL 3.0 system software, user-level applications and custom hardware. It includes the accelerator chip which has a built-in CXL 3.0 controller, CXL switching and end-points. These are are fully compatible with all CXL protocols, such as CXL.io, CXL.cache, and CXL.mem.\nThe switch has a software fabric manager function to manage internal routing rules within the switch, and can connect to other CXL switches and external devices,\nThe framework justifies its All-In-One name by having a software stack featuring a Linux-based OS with CXL device drivers and a CXL-aware virtual memory system. This means applications can use the shared CXL external memory with no code change\nPanmnesia\u2019s memory sharing uses back invalidation to enable endpoints, the memory expander modules, to manage the cache coherency between hosts. There is register-to-register transfer between a host and its accelerator chip.\nA You Tube demo video shows 8TB of CXL-attached memory being made available to the host and 8KB of the memory space set shareable. Another host could then access the sharable memory and the two hosts share data via the shared memory space.\nPanmnesia says that some HPC plasma simulation applications speed up 1.8x by using its shared memory instead of accessing SSDs to get data. It also claims that AI applications can achieve an up to 101x speed up through the accelerator chip, because it is tailored to AI search with frequent parallelized vector processing.\nCES 2024 will take place in Las Vegas from January 9 to January 12.\nPanmnesia raised a $12.5 million seed round in September, giving the company an $81.4 million valuation. The round was led by Daekyo Investment, with participation from SL Investment, Smilegate Investment, GNTech Venture Capital, Time Works Investment, Yuanta Investment and Quantum Ventures Korea.\nIsraeli startup UnifabriX is also working in the CXL 3.0 shared memory area with its MAX memory and storage machine. It has an Early Access Program (EAP), with agreements with High-Performance Computing (HPC) entities for MAX testing and validation. This has been expanded to include companies with on-prem/cloud data centers needing to handle AI workloads.\nStorage news ticker \u2013 January 24\nWasabi gets into AI-powered video content metadata generation\nGrokking Groq\u2019s Groqness\nObservability is key in the AI era\nTSMC and ITRI unveil ultra-efficient SOT MRAM\nStorage news ticker \u2013 January 19\nABOUT US\nBlocks & Files is a storage news, information and analysis site covering storage media, devices from drives through arrays to server-based storage, cloud storage, networking and protocols, data management, suppliers and standards.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "South Korean AI chip firm Panmnesia raises $12.5M in seed funding with a valuation exceeding $81.4M\nPanmnesia, a South Korea-based fabless semiconductor company focused on CXL (Compute Express Link) technology, has on Friday announced its successful completion of a seed funding round amassing $12.5 million.\nPanmnesia said in a statement that this significant financial feat led to the company\u2019s post-money valuation soaring to an impressive $81.4 million.\nAccording to the statement, leading the investment charge was Daekyo Investment.\nThe round also witnessed contributions from a consortium of seven esteemed investment entities including SL Investment, Smilegate Investment, GNTech Venture Capital, Time Works Investment, Yuanta Investment, and Quantum Ventures Korea.\nPanmnesia was born out of the collaborative efforts of a talented group of Ph.D. graduates from the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).\nThey were guided under the expert mentorship of Professor Myoungsoo Jung.\nWith its foundation firmly set on groundbreaking research and innovation, Panmnesia is committed to offering a comprehensive suite of solutions encompassing CXL semiconductor IP, leading-edge data processing acceleration solutions, and holistic CXL-driven technologies.\nIt is noted that CXL is rapidly gaining traction as a transformative interface technology designed to seamlessly connect diverse system devices, including memory expansion units, accelerators, processors, and switches.\nIts promise lies in the ease it offers in memory capacity augmentation and its prowess in streamlining data processing.\nOne standout feature of CXL, memory pooling, stands as a beacon for data center efficiency, presenting avenues for substantial cost savings in memory-related operations. Given these advantages, tech giants such as Meta, Microsoft, and Google are demonstrating heightened interest in CXL-centric solutions.\nAligning with this trend, global semiconductor powerhouses including Intel, AMD, Samsung Electronics, and SK Hynix have laid out their strategic blueprints to introduce CXL-compliant devices.\nEchoing this widespread enthusiasm, market projections hint at the CXL domain expanding to a robust $20 billion by the year 2030, placing Panmnesia in an enviable position to capitalize on these unfolding opportunities.\nPanmnesia\u2019s efforts came into the limelight when they presented the world\u2019s first CXL 2.0-based full- system memory pooling framework last year.\nExtending its technical lead, the company unveiled a solution this May that accelerates data center-oriented Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications, using CXL 3.0 technology.\nThe company also disclosed a full system, from devices to operating systems this year, connected through a multi-level switch architecture supporting CXL 3.0.\n\u201cCXL 3.0 takes a fundamentally different viewpoint from CXL 2.0 in its approach to various processors and memory semiconductor devices to support high scalability,\n\u201cRegrettably, most companies are still only discussing certain features of CXL 1.1 or 2.0.\u201d said Myoungsoo Jung, Chief Executive Officer of Panmnesia.\nHe added that Panmnesia has already completed the development of hardware and software to support CXL 3.0, which will be of significant assistance to a diverse range of companies utilizing CXL.\n\u201cThe CXL ecosystem has yet to mature fully. Without a comprehensive support framework spanning hardware, software, and the full stack, it\u2019s difficult to harness the proper performance capabilities that CXL offers,\u201d he added.\nJung also emphasized that Panmnesia\u2019s distinct advantage: the company\u2019s CXL solution covers everything, including CXL IP, hardware, system solutions to enable these, and software essential for accelerating artificial intelligence (AI) and data processing at the server and data center levels.\nHe said that these solutions are planned to be available to a broader customer base following the completion of state-of-the-art silicon tape-out later this month.\nLooking forward, he said Panmnesia aims to continue leading the CXL industry.\nHe said the company will further refine its CXL semiconductor technology and develop additional solutions to speed up AI applications and massive parallel data processing through CXL.\n\u201cAlthough many companies have shown interest in CXL, products that effectively employ CXL technology are still hard to find,\u201d he said.\n\u201cPanmnesia will not stop at technological development; we will play a pivotal role in expanding the CXL ecosystem,\u201d he added.\nImage\nText\nAnalysis\nNews\nOpinion\nOverviews\nQ&A and interviews\nStartup profiles\nThought leadership\nVideo\nAbout us\nAbout TNGlobal\nOur Services\nPartner With Us\nJoin Us\nWrite For Us / Tips\nSubscribe: Community newsletter\nSubscribe: Daily Telegram updates\nTECHNODE EDITIONS\nTechNode EN\n\u52a8\u70b9\u79d1\u6280\nTechNode Russian"

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Cherney\n(Reuters) -The South Korean chip startup Panmnesia has raised a seed round that values it at $81.4 million, the company said.\nPanmnesia's business is focused on developing intellectual property around a technology called Compute Express Link (CXL), which allows big data center operators to pool devices such as AI accelerator chips, processors and memory.\nMemory is often a bottleneck for crunching data for AI applications, and pooling it with CXL technology could make it substantially more efficient, the company says.\n\"We do not have a standard interface, so it's very difficult to accommodate all the different AI accelerators in the data center,\" Panmnesia CEO Myoungsoo Jung told Reuters on Tuesday.\nJung said the company\u2019s technology could be of interest to chip design software makers such as Synopsys and Cadence Design Systems. Synopsys and Cadence declined to comment.\nThe company raised $12.5 million led by Daekyo Investment. Other investors included SL Investment, Smilegate Investment, GNTech Venture Capital, Time Works Investment, Yuanta Investment and Quantum Ventures Korea.\nThe South Korean government aims to spur the domestic AI chip industry and plans to spend $800 million over the next five years in an attempt to increase the share of Korean AI chips in domestic data centers to 80% in 2030 from essentially zero.\n(Reporting by Max A.
