Seats in various other stages of production in others. A quality control inspector goes through a rigorous routine while supplies of foam and other materials await their call to action.\nThat's the scene at the suburban Detroit Recaro Automotive factory producing premium seating for everyone from racers to truckers to sports car drivers, office workers and gamers.\nSeats in production at Recaro Automotive factory in Clinton Township, Mich.\nThe company is celebrating the 60th anniversary of its premium seating division through myriad changes and the almost miraculous fact it wasn't gobbled up in the swirl of consolidations in the automotive supplier segment by breaking the same sort of barriers that's kept it alive.\nBest Travel Insurance Companies\nBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans\nEmil Kreycik, Recaro Automotive President and COO\n\u201cI think we did the opposite,\u201d said Emil Kreycik, Recaro Automotive President and COO during an interview at the company's Clinton Township, Mich. headquarters. \u201cThrough 2020 we extracted the business out from a larger business. Our focus has been how do we get strength in our organization? The other was not this need to feel like we needed to be gobbled up. We started off with a with a strong balance sheet and we've just continued to work through those kinds of downtimes like when we weren't producing for OEM seats we focused on how do we strengthen the organization to be more efficient to be more effective.\u201d\nRecaro AM Pro Racer SPG XL ORV and Cross Sportster ORV seats\nIndeed, Recaro produced a long list of firsts that include the first bucket seats, first retrofit seats for vehicles featuring foam upholstery and side bolsters, the first seat with integrated seat belts, the first seat for commercial vehicles with a shock-cushioning system and the first racing shell optimized for the usage of HANS (head and neck support system) to protect race car drivers.\nGoing back to its 1906 beginnings, Recaro Automotive has been responsible for a number of key ... [+] seating innovations.\nThrough six decades Recaro's gone through almost as many changes as its product line. Its true genesis occurred back in 1906 with the founding of Stuttgarter Carosserie- u. Radfabrik (Stuttgart Body and Wheel Factory)\nIn 1963 REutter CAROsserie became seating specialist, RECARO. It remained that way until 2011 when the Recaro Automotive Seating unit was purchased by licensing partner Johnson Controls, morphing into a business unit and premium brand for Johnson Controls spinoff Adient five years later.\nIn 2020 Adient sold its Recaro Automotive Seating business to Raven Acquisitions LLC, a Detroit based, privately owned investment corporation with Recaro operating as an independent corporate structure.\nEmploying about 500 people globally, Recaro has locations in the U.S., Germany and Japan.\nIts four product segments are:\n\u00b7 OEM: Premium brands, limited editions, high-end performance options\n\u00b7 Commercial vehicle: Mass transit, heavy-duty vehicles, military\n\u00b7 Aftermarket\n\u00b7 Classic: Aftermarkets, performance comfort seats, performance tunings\nNo matter its name, structure or ownership, adherence to certain key criteria has been a constant explained Nicole McElroy, Recaro Automotive Global Vice President of Product Development and Brand.\nNicole McElroy, Recaro Automotive Global Vice President of Product Development and Brand\n\u201cWe call it form follows human form. What form follows human is the philosophy of the engineering and design of our seats so it's always around the human ergonomics\u201d said McElroy during an interview. \u201cIt has to have some type of innovation to the product. It has to meet the comfort standards. It has to have quality execution, because that's what people are paying for and the safety is very important. If it's not safe we're not gonna have it out.\u201d\nDuring a quick stroll through a product display area, McElroy and Kreycik ran through Recaro's latest innovations starting with seating for commercial vehicles that must survive a ton of punishment over a long time for a broad range of drivers.\nA range of Recaro commercial seating that must be durable and last at least 10 years.\n\u201cIt has to go from a fifth percentile to the 95th percentile. It has to be able to last 10 years. They have to be able to sit over 10 hours. They have to be able to hold up to 500 pounds,\u201d said McElroy. \u201cHigh wear, ingress, egress.\u201d\nTo do that Recaro uses a material called \u201crhino vinyl\u201d that McElroy explains the company saw used in race cars that's washable and durable and can withstand punishment it can take from HANS safety devices.\nComfortable and safe seating for professional drivers is a financial concern for employer with Kreycik noting, \u201cWhen you look at industry we service their third biggest cost is workman\u2019s comp. The whole concept of form following the human body is actually what helps them reduce those expenses by making a more comfortable, more supportive seat for their operators.\u201d\nMcElroy turns our attention to some aftermarket seats designed to protect drivers in extreme conditions from serious injury.\n\u201cIf you\u2019re doing a loop, going really fast and high impact it basically dissipates the energy from hitting into the spine. It\u2019s almost like a coral hard foam and it has little air pockets like a coral and it takes that and separates the energy from going into the body,\u201d said McElroy.\nPro driver Vaughn Gittin Jr. sitting in a Recaro Automotive AM Pro racer SPG XL ORV seat.\nFor road and track, Recaro is using lightweight carbon fiber to produce a seat that's only 15 pounds.\nLightweighting is a key requirement as automakers boost production of electric vehicles since excess weight can reduce battery range.\n\u201cEverything we're doing with that product line is focused on lighter weight,\u201d said Kreycik. \u201cIt's a tough engineering problem to solve so that you can create more space in the floor for the batteries. So that is very, very critical to cars, and a little less so for SUVs. Every point in that design of that seat has been really focused on you know, optimization with EVs in the back of our mind.\u201d\nKreycik says Recaro is also well poised to pivot to serve a move to more on-demand vehicle production as automakers look to reduce costs and dealer inventories, noting, \u201cI think we're extremely well positioned for on demand. You know, there's obviously some risk involved in it. We make forecasts, we make assumptions. But our target is to be in a position of customer picks up the phone and make makes the call and says hey, I want this product and we can support our dealers within days no more than a few weeks.\u201d\nBoth McElroy and Krecik give credit to long time chief engineer of industrial design Frank Beermann who has been a leader and guiding light for a new generation of designers as well as the company\u2019s engineering team for the company\u2019s constant innovations and devotion to its key pillars.\nWhat's ahead for this sexagenarian seating company? Kreycik says Recaro will continue to focus on its broad customer portfolio of automakers as well as continuing to support the commercial and aftermarket businesses.\nIn addition, \u201cwe want to strengthen our presence to continue to build our dealer network, something that I would say in the past was, given the ownership, it was not really understood,\u201d said Kreyck, \u201cso we've made it a priority and we've actually seen significant growth since we've taken the business over.\u201d\nRecaro Automotive has expanded its product line to what's known as Classic Lifestyle Chairs\nExecutive seating, the new moniker for office desk chairs, is also a growth area according to McElroy along with what's known as sim seating used for high performance gaming.\n\u201cWe're adding some cool trim,\u201d said McElroy. \u201cPut in onto a sim rig, go head and start gaming.\u201d\nIndeed, some spectators at certain professional sports stadiums McElroy and Kreycik said they were contractually not permitted to name will be viewing contests from the comfort of Recaro seats.\nThrough all its changes McElroy says what's been a big reason Recaro continues to survive and thrive is, \u201cA very dedicated team that's very passionate about what we do. We would not be successful without the team that's within every region, because it's the people.\u201d\nKreycik is proud of how the company navigated production cutbacks and supply chain challenges brought on by the Covid pandemic declaring saying the privately-held company's balance sheet remains strong and is on track to maintain that trend.\nFrom his comfortable Recaro seat, Kreycik smiles as he declares, \u201cWe're just in a really good place.\u201d"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Live: News from Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Sony, Mullen, Vinfast and more in Las Vegas\nIf you can't be there in person, this is the next best thing\nWe've gotten a lot more automotive (and related) news from CES 2024 than we were expecting. There's been a ton of fun news and cool reveals as the show really gets going into high gear. With major reveals, updates and news from huge automakers and brands like Honda, Hyundai, Kia, Sony, Mercedes-Benz and Vinfast, there's plenty to keep automotive enthusiasts interested this year in Las Vegas.\nWe've already seen a few new vehicles (two-wheeled and four-wheeled), AI tech, infotainment upgrades, autonomous technology and even new tires. If that's not enough, we've covered electric boat motors from Mercury, autonomous tractors from John Deere and a couple flying car/drone/copter things.\nAnd we're not done yet. We'll also be bringing you live impressions from the event covering everything from debuts to random musings from the floor. And you can follow all the action live right here.\nTesla home systems to be integrated with Samsung\u2019s Smart Things\nComing soon: Tesla\u2019s universal wall connector, Powerwall 3 and Solar Inverter can be integrated into Samsung\u2019s Smart Things home ecosystem. The key thing here is the Powerwall. In the event of a power outage, Smart Things will now know how much power is available in the Powerwall, and therefore use its Smart Things AI to dictate how much power each of your Samsung appliances and other devices get/use. It also lets you monitor how much power your Tesla charger is using with the Smart Things app.\nWe try BMW's Remote Valet tech at CES 2024\nByron Hurd and James Riswick got to play 007 when they climbed behind the wheel, pedals and multiple displays of BMW's Remote Valet system and drove a BMW iX around a coned-off course. They take their martinis however you want to make them.\nVerge Motorcycles shows off TS Ultra electric bike at CES 2024\nFinland\u2019s Verge Motorcycles rolls its high-tech TS Ultra into CES 2024. Come for the hubless electric rear motor, stay for the advanced sensor safety package.\nHere's a full gallery of live images directly from the show floor in Las Vegas.\nBollinger's electric truck looks painful at CES 2024\nSenior Editor James Riswick: \"The Bollinger truck cabin has to be the most dangerous and painful interior I have ever seen, including old timey Model T era stuff. Hard metal edges everywhere, no padding anywhere. The armrests are wood for ouch sake.\"\nWe plow a field with John Deere tractor ... 1,300 miles away at CES 2024\nTurning tilling duties over to an autonomously operated tractor could therefore be a big-time time and money saver for farmers. Time for Tractorblog!\nHere at CES 2024, John Deere is showing that possibility is already reality. We got a chance to try out John Deere's autonomous tractor tech by tilling a field 1,300 miles away in Austin, Texas. The technology is currently in beta testing with actual owners/farmers throughout the country.\nMullen Five RS revealed at CES 2024, claims 1,000 horsepower\nMullen came to CES 2024 with some serious electrified firepower in the form of the Mullen Five RS.\nThe Mullen Five RS will feature dual motors with at least 1,000 horsepower and 850 pound-feet of torque and, surprisingly, a two-speed transmission. Those motors will apparently push the 5,070-pound to 50 in under 2 seconds and eventually up to a 200-mph top speed.\nRecaro shows off sim racing seats at CES 2024\nRecaro is showing off a range of advanced seating options for sim racing and endurance racing at CES 2024 in Las Vegas.\nThe Pro Supreme GT FPR seat, a product of a collaboration between Recaro Automotive and Ford Performance Racing, conceived specifically for the Ford Mustang GT3.\nMoving down the technology spectrum is Recaro FeelTech+, a set of seat insert pads that work with several different Recaro seats. It leverages what Recaro calls Metahaptics, offering immersive haptic and touch experiences for sim racing, e-sports and upscale video games.\nThe seats that can work with FeelTech+ are the Recaro Pro Sim Star, Recaro Profi SPG/SPG XL, the Recaro Pole Position, and the Recaro Sport C with haptics.\nHonda debuts new 'H mark' logo at CES 2024\nIt\u2019s been about 43 years since we\u2019ve seen a redesign of the familiar \u201cH mark\u201d that Honda so lovingly calls it. That changes today at the 2024 CES where Honda debuted a new H mark that is destined for future electric vehicles.\nMercury Marine electrifies boat motors at CES 2024\nYes, this is Autoblog. No, it's not Aquablog. No matter; these new electric boat motors, batteries and controllers from Mercury Marine are more than enough to float our boats (sorry).\nHyundai Mobion Concept does cool (orchestral) maneuvers (in the dark) at CES 2024\nIt also drives diagonally, projects crosswalks for pedestrians, warns others of obstacles.\nA post shared by James Riswick (@jamesriswick)\nThe eVTOL Flying Car from XPeng Aeroht has spinning blades right at head level\nThis is the eVTOL Flying Car from XPeng Aeroht, which as the name and eight carbon fiber whiring blades would suggest, is a flying car concept (among others from this CES and past ones).\nAll those blades fold into the body, allowing you to drive down the street without taking anybody\u2019s head off. And to be clear, that would absolutely happen. They\u2019re basically at neck level for almost every adult.\nVinFast showed the VF Wild electric truck at CES 2024. Here's what we know so far\nThe VinFast VF Wild electric pickup truck is definitely in the midsize range, so similar to a Rivian R1T or possibly a Toyota Tacoma. The bed certainly appears to be longer than Rivian's as-is. But like a Chevy Silverado EV, it can be extended with a midgate.\nThe design is Italian, but unlike the Pininfarina-designed VinFast lineup on sale in America today, this concept was done by Torino Design.\nThe interior looks quite upmarket with lots of brown leather and charcoal gray accent cloth.\nIt's definitely a concept, and as noted on the display, features such as the power midgate are not guaranteed for any production model, and we imagine that the truck has not yet been greenlit.\nThis is a Togg. It is from a Turkish company that makes cars. I guess?\nSenior Editor James Riswick: After examining the various displays and placards to no avail, I asked one of the many people working this stand the very pointed question of \u201cwhat is Togg?\u201d\nI received an answer of a three-pronged solution to eliminating carbon from your life through their Trumore app, energy storage facilities that let you shunt excess solar power from your power company to something you control for later use or donation (how, the presenter didn\u2019t know), and electric cars. Sorry, \u201cSmart mobility device.\u201d They were very pointed about that. The sedan showed here was unveiled today, but apparently Togg\u2019s SUV, the T10X, is for sale. Somewhere.\nI tried, I promise. But for a gigantic stand with a sea of people working at it, that was the best I could come up with. Well, unless I wanted to devote more of my life to Togg. I do not.\nThe Mansory Empower isn't at CES, but it looks like it should be\nCould it be that Mansory is looking to capitalize on flying car news that's sifting out of the Las Vegas hallways during CES 2024?\nMansory stresses that its Empower concept isn't an accurate preview of an upcoming production model. It acknowledges that \"no one can say for sure\" what the car of the future will look like, and that regardless of whether it flies, floats, or travels underground, buyers will always want customization options.\nTo repeat, the Mansory Empower is not at CES. But it sure looks like it should be, right?\nThe VinFast VF 3 is probably smaller than you think it is\nVinFast brought its itty bitty electric SUV, the VF 3, to CES 2024, though it's not technically new.\nA quick reintroduction of the VF 3: it's a little two-door SUV very much in the vein of the equally adorable Suzuki Jimny. In fact, it's actually smaller. At just 125.6 inches long, it's nearly 18 inches shorter than the Suzuki.\nVinFast is aiming for 125 miles on a charge. It didn't say what test cycle that's on. If it's on the WLTP test, that could end up being less for the U.S.\nApparently VinFast talked with U.S. dealers about models, and it was suggested the VF 3 could be offered for less than $20,000.\nWe got the biggest scoop at CES 2024\nJames Riswick, ard at work, getting the scoop here at CES ...\nMercedes-AMG and musician will.i.am developed a technology called MBUX Sound Drive\nMBUX Sound Drive that lets owners use their car as both a musical instrument and a recording studio. Although it sounds science fiction-esque, this system is headed to production later in 2024.\nOnboard sensors feed data to a new software that interprets the car's basic movements as sounds. For example, there's a steering sound, a braking sound, and an acceleration sound. So, MBUX Sound Drive lets the driver compose a song by driving. Instead of playing, say, a progression of G, D, C, and G chords on a guitar, on paper your new song might look something like brake, steer, accelerate, and brake.\nAt least Mullen got the mirror reattached...\nAssociate Editor Byron Hurd: \"They managed to replace the driver side door mirror mid-presentation.\"\nThe VinFast VF 3 sure is cool to look at\nThe Vinfast VF 3 has made a fan. Our own Joel Stocksdale: \"Holy crap the VF 3 is so adorable.\"\nHe's not wrong...\nSteering wheel from Magna detects blood-alcohol levels, other signs of driver impairment at CES 2024\nMagna, the global automotive supplier and manufacturer, showed off a new steering wheel at CES that is designed to detect driver impairment, including fatigue and blood-alcohol level. Embedded cameras study eye movements and body language in order to detect drowsiness or impairment.\nThis is not entirely different than existing systems used to determine driver inattention (see Subaru) or making sure drivers are paying attention to the road ahead (see Super Cruise).\nThe big item here, however, is the integration of sensors by Senseair that passively detect alcohol from the ambient air. It can apparently differentiate between breath from the driver and passengers, as well as determine blood-alcohol levels.\nVarious government entities have called for such technologies to prevent drunken driving. As long as the system really can differentiate between breath sources and levels, it certainly seems like a promising idea.\nMercedes-Benz shows off its new MB.OS at CES 2024\nToday at CES 2024, Mercedes says that the first vehicles that will host MB.OS will be its family of MMA platform vehicles, which will include its entry-level models like the CLA, GLA and others.\nOne of the big elements with this new infotainment system will be the AI-driven MBUX Virtual Assistant that runs on MB.OS.\nMercedes says its assistant lives by the principles of \u201cnatural, predictive, personal and empathetic.\u201d You can tailor it however you like via the settings, but it\u2019s designed to learn your routines, offer proactive suggestions and speak to you in a more emotional voice than typical car assistants do. It uses 3D graphics run by the Unity game engine to present itself as a \u201cliving star avatar\u201d to communicate with the driver or passengers in the vehicle.\nMercedes is apparently not a mammal, for it has laid an egg at CES\nSee visual proof here, courtesy of Autoblog's own James Riswick:\nWant to see inside? Sadly there's no yolk, but there is the \u201cMBUX Virtual Assistant\u201d that Mercedes-Benz says is \u201crunning on MB.OS.\u201d\nHyundai Supernal S-A2 VTOL shown off at CES 2024\nAt CES 2024, Hyundai's aircraft-specific subsidiary Supernal showed he latest development of its VTOL (vertical take-off and landing) aircraft called S-A2, along with some specifications.\nIt's an electric aircraft, and it features eight full-tilt rotors. The passenger arrangement is set at four plus the pilot. It's designed to cruise at 120 mph at 1,500 feet and handle 25- to 40-mile trips.\nThis cute 'lil bugger is the VinFast VF 3. These pics are live from CES 2024\nNow this thing looks adorable. It's small, which means for America it would probably be seen as an urban commuter. Which also means its estimated range of 125 miles might be sufficient. More to come.\nThis is the VinFast VF Wild electric truck at CES 2024\nWe don't know much about it yet \u2014 it's electric, of course, has a huge door opening and a power midgate \u2014 but as soon as we do, so will you. For now, here are some live pictures from the show floor.\nAnd here's the Honda 0 Series Space-Hub at CES 2024\nHonda's second concept, dubbed the Space-Hub, is described as a \"flexible space that immediately accommodates a variety of passengers and becomes a \u201chub\u201d that connects people to each other and the outside world,\" whatever that means.\nIt looks a lot like a Starfleet shuttlecraft that got tossed back in time and landed at Honda R&D. We could once say the same thing about the Dodge Caravan, but we wont. Oh, oops.\nBehold: The Honda 0 Series Saloon at CES 2024\nThis is the Honda 0 Series Saloon. It will be the first model in the 0 Series lineup, and Honda says it will be the flagship. It's built on a dedicated platform developed using Honda's M//M philosophy: man maximum/machine minimum. Translation: it's low, wide and spacious. And critically, it won't drive itself.\nWe have no idea how to describe what is happening at Mullen right now\nAssociate Editor Byron Hurd: \"I have no idea how to describe what is happening at Mullen right now. Benjamin Franklin\u2026. Tesla\u2026 Henry Ford and Ferry Porsche. And then the door mirror fell off.\"\nNo, we're not joking.\nGet a load of these Honda machines at CES 2024!\nAssociate Editor Byron Hurd: \"Honda is starting over \u201cfrom zero\u201d with a new series of lighter, smaller, more engaging EVs. Check out the doors on the Saloon!\"\nGoogle adds new features to Android Auto and cars with Google built-in\nElectric vehicles compatible with Android Auto can share real-time battery information with Google Maps \u2013 coming first to the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning\nStarting to roll out today, you can send the trip you\u2019ve planned on Google Maps on your Android or iOS phone directly to your car with Google built-in\nToday, Chrome browser is starting to roll out to select Polestar and Volvo cars in beta, and will be available in more cars later this year\nWatch shows from PBS KIDS and Crunchyroll, which are both now available in select cars with Google built-in\nThe Weather Channel app is now available for cars with Google built-in, giving you peace of mind on the road. Now you can stay up-to-date on changing weather conditions with hourly forecasts, follow-me, alerting and \u201cTrip View\u201d radar right from your dashboard\nGoodyear and Gatik expand the use of smart tire technology at CES 2024\nGoodyear and Gatik (a company in the in autonomous middle mile B2B logistics field) announced the expansion the use of Goodyear SightLine technology. It allows Gatik to record and interpret tire intelligence data regarding road conditions and tire health.\nGatik is celebrating Day 1 of #CES2024 with big news! We\u2019re integrating @goodyear intelligent tire technology into our autonomous fleet to advance the safety & efficiency of our middle mile operations. Read more: https://t.co/V1qiZ1qzjb pic.twitter.com/JrcwkWvBmv\nSmart tires. Who knew?\nAwaiting the Honda unveiling. This is one to watch, folks.\nAssociate Editor Byron Hurd: \"Waiting for the floor to open on day one of the CES 2024 public show. First stop: Honda.\"\nIndy Autonomous Challenge reveals race car at CES 2024\nA new race car meant for the Indy Autonomous Challenge that was just revealed at CES 2024.\nAs you can see, there ... um, no driver's seat, steering wheel or anything else that would allow a human to race the machine around a course. Hence the \"autonomous challenge\" bit.\nIt's a competition for colleges and universities around the world to develop and race each other in autonomous cars on real racetracks. This next generation of autonomous open-wheel cars will be taken to the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Monza and the Goodwood Festival of Speed to compete for big cash prizes.\nLamborghini may not sound like the type of carmaker you associate with CES, but maybe you should.\nOne of the exciting announcements Lambo made at CES 2024 is a new experimental track connectivity system called Telemetry X that leverages three technologies to help the driver set faster lap times: the Real-Time Remote Garage, the Biometric Data System, and the Digital Co-Pilot.\nSony drove the Afeela onstage with a PlayStation 5 controller\nWe already featured the Sony Afeela Concept on this live blog, but what we didn't show you is how the Japanese giant drove the electric car onto the stage at CES 2024. A yoke? Nope. A PlayStation controller!\n\ud83c\udfae Sony drives its new EV onstage with a PlayStation 5 controller #CES2024 pic.twitter.com/2Q6zcxmeRS\nSony Honda Mobility says the Afeela is still on track to be released later this decade, and it's making progress on both hardware and software.\nGoodyear makes tires greener, longer lasting at CES 2024\nGoodyear used CES 2024 to show off its new ElectricDrive 2 tires. Since EVs tend to weigh a lot, they can go through tires faster than owners expect. These new ElectricDrive 2 tires are designed to last a lot longer.\nGoodyear expects the tires to be commercially available in North America starting in May.\nThe Afeela is back! And it's... the same?\nSHM says it's been upgraded with better AI tech, but there's not much new to see here.\nKia's new PBV family is cute and weird\nKia's forthcoming lineup of PBVs is quite fascinating. I'm skeptical that the \"Human Centipede\" tricks will be valuable in the real world, but the emphasis on both loading and boarding from the tailgate makes me wonder why we haven't seen more rear ingress/egress tricks with electric vans and SUVs. You could probably fit four PV1s in a pull-through Texan parking space (imagine them side-by-side and nose-to-nose. Wild, right?\nThe best part about the Kia PBV vans? They're real, and they're coming soon.\nReviews Editor Zac Palmer: \"I would totally ride around in one of these Kia PBV vans if they sold it here. The modular body swapping sounds a bit aspirational on paper, but the idea is neat.\n\"The best part of the PBV reveal is that Kia actually plans on making these cute and useful vans. There\u2019s a whole lot of hot air typically associated with CES, so concrete production plans for as soon as 2025 sure are nice to see.\"\nKia shows off five versions of its Platform Beyond Vehicle, or PBV for short\nKia's Platform Beyond Vehicle isn\u2019t just one vehicle. In fact, there are five PBVs that were just revealed at CES \u2013 three versions of the Concept PV5, the Concept PV7 and the Concept PV1. All of them are electric.\nAll of the PV vehicles share a similar design language that can most succinctly be described as practical. They\u2019re van-like but without much of a front end to maximize the utility behind the driver and maintain a smaller overall footprint.\nRead the full story here.\nCES 2024 floor highlight: Volkswagen\nBetween other events, I cruised the Volkswagen display, which still had the ID.7 and updated GTI on the stand. Very much looking forward to trying out the GTI's updated tech when it arrives; it's so good to drive but so frustrating to live with.\nIt's a busy day at the Las Vegas Convention Center for CES 2024\nAutoblog Associate Editor Byron Hurd: \"Watching the Hyundai conference from the overflow room due to overcapacity on the main CES show floor.\"\nIt's a busy day at the Las Vegas Convention Center, folks.\nHyundai talks hydrogen and vehicle software at CES 2024\nHyundai let loose on some major plans for the future at CES 2024, mostly surrounding hydrogen and software.\nHyundai will be lumping basically every aspect of its hydrogen work including \"production, storage, transportation, and utilization\" under its HTWO brand (get it?).\n<News Editor Joel Stocksdale, who covered the news for Autoblog, is intrigued by all this cool-sounding hydrogen stuff>\nHyundai referred to its desire to have software-defined everything, or \"SDx.\" What this means is Hyundai will be working on creating its own app market, making development kits available for people and companies to develop apps for Hyundai vehicles. Why should Apple and Google have all the app (and data and monetization) fun to themselves?\n<News Editor Joel Stocksdale, who covered the news for Autoblog, reported that his eyes glazed over at the software stuff>\nClick here for all the details. Sorry in advance if your eyes are like Joel's when you're done reading through it.\nMullen shows of an electric truck and will later debut the Mullen FIVE RS, a \"high-performance EV crossover\"\nWe don't hear much from Mullen Automotive, but the company is on the scene at CES 2024 with several machines to show off. One worth mentioning is the Mullen Three, an electric Class 3 truck that's being shown in two forms.\nThe Bollinger B1 and B2 will also be there, and that reminds us how cool those super boxy off-roaders would have been to see out in the wild. Ah well, at least CES showgoers will get another look at 'em.\nMeet the #MullenTHREE, the electric workhorse redefining urban utility vehicles \ud83d\ude9aThis #Class3 low cab forward #EV truck features a robust payload, superior maneuverability, and versatile chassis.Stop by our booth at @CES to learn how you can elec-THREE-fy your fleet:Jan\u2026 pic.twitter.com/D1gRW0qPt8\nNVIDIA has its hardware and software all over the place at CES 2024\nYou might know NVIDIA mostly for its high-end computer technology, but the chipmaker is deeply involved in the automotive manufacturing world, too. Says the company's latest news release:\n\"Amid explosive interest in generative AI, the auto industry is racing to embrace the power of AI across a range of critical activities, from vehicle design, engineering and manufacturing, to marketing and sales.\"\nWith highlights from Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Pebble (the high-tech trailer company), robotaxi company Zoox and more, NVIDIA clearly has its hands and silicon all over the CES 2024 show floor.\nPanasonic introduces Neuron. Don't worry, it's super easy to understand. Right?\nPanasonic hit the stage at CES 2024 to announce its High-Performance Compute (HPC) system. It's named Neuron (clever, right?), and from what we can decipher, it's a computing platform that includes both hardware and software aimed at extending a vehicle's potential lifecycle by reducing the number of traditional high-cost components and replacing them with new versions that can be upgraded over the life of the vehicle.\nFor the truly techy car enthusiasts out there, here's Panasonic's overview:\n\"With a streamlined design, the Neuron HPC incorporates up-integration capability by consolidating multiple ECUs into one centralized nucleus to handle all levels of ADAS, chassis, body, and in-cabin infotainment features.\"\nThere's more at Panasonic's news site, but for the rest of us, maybe a video would make things easier to understand.

The company says,\"Global energy consumption has doubled in the past 50 years \u2013 and continues to grow by around 2 percent each year. Fossil fuels currently account for some 80 percent of global energy consumption.\"\nA couple highlights:\nAutomated valet charging (a CES\u00ae 2024 Innovation Award honoree)\nElectric cars featuring this new technology can drive themselves to an available parking space furnished with a charging spot. At the touch of a button on a smartphone, a robot charges the battery without any further human intervention. Once charging is complete, the vehicle maneuvers driverlessly to another parking space, leaving the spot free for the next car.\nBosch \"sees hydrogen as a key to meeting the world\u2019s energy needs in a climate-neutral way\"\nThe focus is currently on the mobile fuel cell, which recently went into volume production in Stuttgart. This lies at the heart of the powertrain system for heavy vehicles. Bosch has already received its first orders from truck manufacturers in Europe, the U.S., and China. The company is also working on components for a hydrogen engine, which converts fuel directly into energy without first converting it into electricity. When powered by green hydrogen, this engine is practically carbon neutral. The H2 engine is due to debut this year.\nUsage Certificate To Go and Vehicle Health Service\nThe feature analyzes battery data, determines the battery\u2019s condition, and helps extend its service life by up to 20 percent through optimization. The second service, aimed at fleet operators, offers features designed above all to prevent vehicle breakdowns.\nWhether on the road, at home, or in factories, we're driving forward the electrification of our #technologies for #sustainable energy use. \ud83c\udf43 Two examples are our heat pump for colder climates & our automated valet charging solution: https://t.co/imiMxFyAY5 #BoschCES #CES2024 pic.twitter.com/yzukGjVpX5\nLG announces production of EV chargers in the United States\nMore EV chargers in the United States is definitely a welcome development.

Located in Clinton Township, Michigan, the official ribbon cutting ceremony for the facility took place on Oct. 6. Earlier this year, Recaro Automotive was acquired by Raven Acquisitions LLC, and the opening of this facility marks a new chapter in the company\u2019s storied history.\nThe new, automotive facility will be responsible for OEM, commercial vehicle and aftermarket seats. Additionally, international shipments of seating materials and products will be processed through this specific plant moving forward. Recaro\u2019s most recent product launch, the brand\u2019s first-ever off-road seats, will soon begin production at Recaro Automotive HQ. These seats, known as the\u00a0Pro Racer SPG XLORV\u00a0and the\u00a0CrossSportster ORV, will come to market by the end of 2020 for customer purchase. To support these endeavors, the Recaro Automotive HQ will create job opportunities for workers within the Detroit area.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to announce the opening of our Recaro North American facility and a range of new job opportunities for individuals in the Michigan area,\u201d said Emil Kreycik, Recaro\u2019s president and CEO. \u201cAs we continue to present cutting-edge products, we\u2019re excited to open this advanced U.S. hub for production and innovation. Through our seat offerings, we\u2019re confident that we will continue to help our customers achieve peak performance and inspire a passion for driving.\u201d\nRecaro worked hand-in-hand with community leaders throughout the site selection and construction process. The official ribbon cutting, which featured a speech by Emil Kreycik and a product display, was attended by Bob Cannon, Clinton Township Supervisor and Jack Johns, project manager at Macomb County Department of Planning & Economic Development. Moving forward, private and socially distanced tours of the facility will be available by appointment for OEM customers and Recaro\u2019s marketing partners.\nFollowing the acquisition of Recaro Automotive Seating by Raven Acquisitions LLC, the company continues to focus on its core business \u2013 performance seats and ergonomic seats, as well as special applications. This new structure allows for shorter and faster decision-making processes with greater flexibility to better meet the requirements of the market, aftermarket, commercial and OEM customers.\nREMANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY\nMPA comprehensive clean-tech remanufacturing process produces superior performance and reliability, but it also makes a significant positive impact in terms of sustainability.\nManufacturers\u2019 Perspectives: The Aftermarket in 2024\nFind out what aftermarket parts manufacturers have in store for their businesses and what they\u2019re expecting for 2024 and beyond.\nA new year brings new growth opportunities, and according to several parts manufacturers, 2024 is showing positive signs. Vehicle miles driven is up, which means cars need more maintenance\u2014that means replacement parts. The average price of new cars has increased, meaning drivers will be holding onto their vehicles longer. With the average vehicle age at 12 years, opportunities for replacement part sales and tweaking the coverage, ordering and distribution of them abound for manufacturers and all stakeholders in the automotive aftermarket.\nMore than 770 new parts for passenger cars in North America were introduced by ZF last year.\nThe remanufactured Advantage clutches offer OE specifications at a more affordable price.\nThe move is part of HosePower\u2019s strategy to expand its hydraulic and industrial hose solutions and service operations.\nThe acquisition was finalized in December 2023 and allows TMD Friction to remain an independent entity with its own brand.\nThe 100% new part numbers cover more than 54 million VIO.\nThe campaign focuses on educating all stakeholders on recycling practices for vehicle batteries.\nAs part of the new strategy, Castrol will explore opportunities in battery thermal management, digital and service solutions and data center immersion cooling.\nThe company said its Restore & Protect motor oil removes engine-killing deposits with continuous use.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nOur Brands\nThe Business of Selling Parts\n\u00a9 Copyright\nBabcox Media Inc.

ChatGPT-enabled infotainment\nVolkswagen announced that it has integrated the AI-based chatbot ChatGPT into its IDA voice assistant, ushering in a new era in automotive technology.\nThe advancement was enabled by the firm's collaboration with Cerene Inc. via its Chat Pro system. The feature will be offered in the current generation of Volkswagen models based on its MEB and MQB Evo platforms and those that use its IDA voice assistant.\nVolkswagen\nBy integrating with Cerence Chat Pro, the innovation enhances the functionalities of the IDA voice assistant. Users will be able to control a range of functions spanning from infotainment and navigation to air conditioning control, all using voice commands. Additionally, it can also provide answers to general questions, ending those in-car arguments.\nThe integration of ChatGPT through Cerence Chat Pro is designed with a focus on user privacy and data protection by excluding access to any vehicle-specific information.\nThis feature will be accessible across a range of Volkswagen models from early 2024, including the new Tiguan and Passat, the new Golf, and the ID.3, ID.4, ID.5, and ID.7.\n4. Honda's 'O' EV lineup\nThe Japanese automaker unveiled its 'Honda 0 Series', a new electric vehicle (EV) lineup set to hit North American roads from 2026 onwards. The company also unveiled a brand-new emblem for the iconic 'H mark'. The emblem will be exclusively reserved for the upcoming generation of EV models.\nTwo concept vehicles in the Honda 0 Series were also premiered at CES 2024 \u2014 Saloon\u00a0and\u00a0Space-Hub. The Saloon represents the leading concept model within its new EV series, developed from the brand's philosophy of being \"Thin, Light, and Wise.\" The model, which is built on a new EV-only platform, features a low-floor, sporty dynamics, and efficient powertrains. The streamlined and futuristic design of the Saloon features a wedged nose, a flowing roofline, gullwing doors, and a high-set rear.\nThe Space Hub was developed\u00a0under the theme of \u201caugmenting people's daily lives\". The car features a panoramic roof and is designed to complement passengers seated facing each other at the back of the vehicle.\nWhile specific details on the powertrain and battery capacities available for the Honda 0 Series were not released, the company claims that all models will feature e-axles, which integrate the motor, inverter, and gearbox into the car's axle. Honda also claims these cars will support rapid charging, with a 15 to 80 percent charge taking less than 15 minutes.\nEnvisioning a greener automotive industry, Honda also shared its intention to make everything it produces and does carbon-neutral by 2050. The company confidently stated that it aims to sell only EVs and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) globally by 2040.\n3. Sony's updated Afeela EV\nAt CES 2024, Sony announced the updated Afeela, a concept EV that was originally unveiled last year, by driving it onto the stage using a PS5 controller. A joint venture project with Honda as part of Sony Honda Mobility (SHM), the Afeela is an evolution from Sony's Vision S concept.\nIn addition to its remote control operations, the company also showcased a range of updates to the Afeela concept. Along with offering an array of games, the company's collaboration with Epic Games has now enabled augmented reality (AR) mapping. Utilizing data from the car's myriad sensors, and powered by the powerful Unreal Engine 5, SHM now offers immersive 3D maps of the car's surroundings, enhancing safety for occupants.\nSHM also plans to utilize this technology in gaming and entertainment domains as well, for which it is collaborating with virtual reality player Polyphony Digital. The partnership aims to create an immersive experience within the car.\nIn a strategic move, SHM has entered into an agreement with Microsoft, tapping into the Azure OpenAI Service to create a conversational, personal, customized agent for Afeela. SHM is also unlocking the doors of Afeela's developer space to create a platform for creators and developers to innovate and construct applications and services compatible with the EV.\nSHM has announced that it will start taking preorders for Afeela in 2025, with deliveries scheduled to begin in the spring of 2026. With two behemoths in the technology and automotive space joining hands to innovate, we expect much more to come out of the Afeela project in the coming years.\n2. Snapdragon Digital Chassis\nQualcomm Technologies and Robert Bosch GmbH announced the automotive industry\u2019s first central vehicle computer that is capable of hosting both infotainment and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) functionalities on a single system-on-chip (SoC).\nThe advancement will enable a central system to handle tasks related to safety and security requirements, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and automated driving requirements.\nThe cockpit and ADAS integration platform utilizes the Snapdragon Ride Flex System-on-Chip (SoC), which is an advanced and adaptable solution designed to support mixed-criticality workloads and offer high-performance capabilities. \"With this cost-effective solution, we are paving the way for bringing even more ADAS functions into vehicles, including in the entry-level and mid-range segment,\" said Christoph Hartung, president of the Cross-Domain Computing Solutions division at Bosch, in a statement.\nmetamorworks/iStock\nQualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chasis is already offering a suite of functionalities starting with the Snapdragon Auto Connectivity Platform that provides seamless and secure connectivity, cloud services, and over-the-air updates for vehicles. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon Cockpit Platform provides immersive experiences with features like high-resolution displays, 3D audio, voice, and gesture recognition, and augmented reality for both drivers and passengers.\nOn the other hand, the Snapdragon Ride Platform utilizes AI and computer vision to drive advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving features, including lanekeeping, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance. Lastly, the Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud ensures secure and scalable cloud connectivity, data management, and analytics tailored for vehicles.\n1. World's first digital cockpit\nStellantis, BlackBerry QNX, and AWS have teamed up to unveil\u00a0a first-of-its-kind virtual cockpit for automobiles at this year's CES.\nPart of the group's Virtual Engineering Workbench (VEW), the platform will greatly accelerate the delivery of cutting-edge car technology to customers. The key to this acceleration lies in the utilization of QNX Hypervisor in the cloud from BlackBerry, which functions as a virtual lab for developing car controls and systems.\nThe platform enables the creation of \"realistic virtual versions of car controls and systems, making them behave just like they would in a real car, but without needing to change the main software that runs them, taking what used to take months to be achieved down to 24 hours in some cases,\u201d according to a statement from the company.\nThrough the utilization of QNX Hypervisor via AWS Marketplace, Stellantis can now introduce an advanced simulation of a virtual cockpit into a cloud-based environment. The collaboration between Stellantis and AWS, a prominent cloud services provider, was established in January 2022.\nAccording to Stellantis, the virtual cockpit platform is equipped with impressive tools for the virtualization of graphics, audio, and inputs from the touchscreen, mouse, and keyboard. \"Software is becoming increasingly crucial in vehicles, leading us to innovate in how we develop and validate it. With our virtual cockpit, we're revolutionizing not just our approach, but also that of our suppliers and partners in the industry,\" said Yves Bonnefont, Chief Software Officer at Stellantis, in a statement."

The feature will launch with the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, showing you the estimated battery level at arrival, suggesting charge stops, and estimating charging times along the way. Volvo EVs and some GM EVs already have this feature, and it\u2019s very helpful because it helps curb range anxiety. It adds predictability, offers more choice, and lets you select your route based on your charge without relying on the car\u2019s built-in navigation system.\nGoogle Built-In, the operating system used by Volvo and GM, among others, is adding the Chrome web browser (for use when parked). The system also adds The Weather Channel app to show you the weather along your route.\nHonda EV Concepts\nHonda brought two concept cars to debut what it calls the Honda 0 (Zero) Series, a new line of EVs that will launch in 2026. \u201cThe mobility we dream of is not an extension of the trend of \u2018thick, heavy, but smart\u2019 EVs,\u201d said Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda. \u201cWe will create a completely new value from zero based on thin, light and wise as the foundation for our new Honda 0 EV series to further advance the joy and freedom of mobility to the next level.\u201d\nThe concept above with the rectangular nose and gullwing doors is called the Saloon. Its stance is low and wide. Honda says a vehicle based on this concept will arrive in 2026, and it marks not just a new era for Honda electrification, but its styling is nothing like what we've seen from the brand so far.\nThe chunkier concept is called the Space-Hub. Honda didn\u2019t mention if we\u2019d see something in production based on this one, but it might preview what an Odyssey minivan might look like in the future.\nHonda 0 Series models will get the company\u2019s most advanced autonomous driving features. They will also have new e-Axles that the company says will deliver high levels of power and efficiency, along with a battery that Honda says will not degrade more than 10 per cent after 10 years of use.\nHyundai All-In on Hydrogen\nHyundai presented its vision for hydrogen-powered vehicles including passenger vehicles and heavy trucks going forward. The brand remains heavily invested in the tech and plans to develop new large-scale green hydrogen production solutions. It is also concentrating on tech that can deliver hydrogen for vehicles from organic waste (including manure) as well as from melting waste plastics.\nThe company said it expects to have vehicles using 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, enough to drive a passenger vehicle 3 billion km. For reference, passenger vehicle traffic in Canada is approximately 333 billion km per year.\nKia Shows Electric Vans\nKia brought a series of concepts for a future commercial electric van. The Platform Beyond Vehicle concepts offer innovative features like vehicle bodies that can be removed and swapped out quickly. Kia suggests that you could use the van for a taxi by day, a delivery van by night, and a camper on the weekend. Kia emphasized software in the concepts, with the goal of improved charge management and better fleet management. The first planned for production is the PV5, the second largest of the four, built at a new plant capable of handling 150,000 units per year.\nLamborghini Performance Biometrics\nThe Lamborghini Telemetry X concept is in-car tech meant to make you a better driver on track. It captures your biometric data for performance monitoring to help you train off the track and monitors your lap times, lines, and pedal performance to help make you faster. Lamborghini says the system offers proactive voice assistance in the vehicle to help you brake and turn at the right spot.\nMercedes Debuts New Infotainment System\nMercedes-Benz announced that its new MB.OS system, first announced two years ago, will make it into vehicles soon. It will offer an AI virtual assistant that Benz says will \u201ccreate an even more natural and intuitive relationship with the car.\u201d The company says the system will allow more natural interaction with the car\u2019s voice command system. It will also include enhanced 3D graphics for the navigation system that can show the driver hazards around the road. More apps will be added, including games, streaming, and even food-ordering apps.\nIn collaboration with Amazon Music and Audible, Benz will add Dolby Atmos to its Burmester audio systems. Benz says Atmos audio, used in movie theatres to provide a more immersive experience, should do the same for in-car listeners. \u201cImmersive audio storytelling enables our customers to benefit fully from the advanced sound technology in our vehicles. For us, unparalleled in-car entertainment is a further dimension of the hyper-personalized user experience,\u201d said Mercedes-Benz CTO Markus Sch\u00e4fer.\nVinFast Shows Cute EV and Wild Pickup Concept\nElectric startup VinFast Auto brought a pair of concepts including the minicar VF 3 and the VF wild pickup concept.\nThe VF 3 is on sale now in Vietnam and is making its debut for the rest of the world \u2013 though there are no details on Canadian availability. It\u2019s small, about half a metre shorter than a Mitsubishi Mirage, and offers an estimated 202 km of range, which isn\u2019t bad considering the $15k price tag in its home country.\nVinFast\u2019s first pickup, the VF Wild, is likely to be much more relevant to Canadians if it makes it to market. The Wild is about the size of a Honda Ridgeline, but powered by electricity. It offers a flexible bed with a midgate (the new EV pickup hot ticket) that lets you extend the bed by using the back seats of the cab, and it has clamshell doors like the best early 2000s trucks. It\u2019s still just a concept, though, with no announcements of any production plans.\nVolkswagen's New AI Assistant\nVolkswagen announced a new digital assistant called IDA, based on ChatGPT AI. VW says it will control infotainment including navigation as well as climate control. It can also answer general knowledge questions and have a conversation with you. The refreshed Golf will get the feature, along with the ID.3, 4, 5, and ID.7 models, as well as the new Tiguan, with arrivals starting in 2024.\nVW also showed off the refreshed Golf GTI. Though the hot hatch was masked by camouflage, we can see some of the detailing including new head and tail lights.\nRelated Articles\nAbout Us\nDealer Services\nResources\nPartners\nCustomer Support"

This allows operators to ensure that their drivers comply with seat-belt usage requirements and helps ensure that the belts are not being worn improperly when they are in use.\nRECARO RCP Concept SeatContinuing the success of the RECARO Sport C modular frame structure, the company advances the technology even further to provide OEMs with even more seating options in new vehicles.\nThe RECARO RCP (RECARO Comfort Platform) Concept unites two iconic products, the RECARO Sport and RECARO Ideal Comfort seats. Built on the RECARO Sport C seat frame, the Ideal Comfort Concept features a low block height and a seatback frame that can support an adjustable headrest. This backbone\u2019s modularity lets RECARO's OEM partners flex between a Pure Performance (RECARO Sport) integrated-headrest seatback or, for more comfort/touring-oriented applications, the Performance Comfort (RECARO Ideal Comfort) seatback with an adjustable headrest.\nBoth variants are displayed at the RECARO booth at CES and are equipped with all-electric 8-way adjustment.\nRECARO Pole Position RCF InfusionIntroduced in 2023 and available in both the RECARO Profi XL RCF and the RECARO Pole Position RCF, RCF Infusion technology broke the mold in how motorsports can embrace sustainability in an authentic and meaningful way by utilizing recycled carbon fiber.\nEach RECARO Recycled Carbon Fiber Infusion shell uses (on average) between 10 and 11% of the dry fiber instead of glass fiber strands. The materials in the shell include braided woven carbon, woven glass, and vinyl ester epoxy resin instead of polyester resin.\nAs a company known for being first-to-market with seating technology, RECARO\u2019s RCF Infusion works to eliminate some of the waste generated after track weekends by recycling carbon fiber that has been left behind while also increasing the strength and durability of the new racing shell through the manufacturing process.\nCES Panel - The Transformation of Motorsports: How Digitization is Driving SustainabilityRECARO Automotive\u2019s Global Vice President of Product Development and Brand Nicole McElroy will participate in a panel discussion around digitization\u2019s impact on sustainability and how that is helping to propel motorsport\u2019s ongoing transformation.\nDate: Tuesday, January 9Time: 9:00 \u2013 9:40 amLocation: Aria, Level 1, Joshua 8\nModerator:\nOther Panelists:\nTECHART GTstreet R FlyweightRECARO fans who visit the company\u2019s CES display will get to see the TECHART GTstreet R Flyweight seat, a thrilling collaboration between RECARO Automotive and renowned German tuning firm, TECHART, which specializes in enhancing Porsche products.
