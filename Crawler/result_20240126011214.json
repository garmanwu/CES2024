        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nRise Gardens\u2019 modular indoor smart garden gets an upgrade\nRise Gardens showed off at CES an improved version of its modular hydroponic smart garden for growing fresh vegetables indoors year round. It sounds like the manufacturer has addressed some of the issues we identified in our Rise Gardens Double Family Garden review, which was first published in August, 2021.\nThe company says the new Rise Garden Charcoal Collection features more durable electronics, a larger water reservoir, and is easier to assemble. The new charcoal color scheme, meanwhile, is meant as an homage to that material\u2019s historical use to increase soil fertility.\nBoth the original and the new Charcoal Collection of the Rise Garden let you grow up to 108 edible plants indoors with a minimum of fuss.\nRise Gardens\nIf you\u2019re unfamiliar with Rise Gardens, the company builds smart, mostly automated hydroponic growing systems featuring circulating water and integrated grow lights. Designed primarily for edible plants\u2014green leafy vegetables, tomatoes, herbs, and the like\u2014the indoor gardening system tracks the growth of your plants and sends push messages when they need liquid fertilizer, when the system\u2019s water reservoir needs to be refilled, and when the plants are ready for harvest.\nRise says this new model is also easier to clean. While our long-term review unit is still performing well and we\u2019re growing fresh produce in the dead of winter, all of the improvements Rise has identified will all be welcome.\nAuthor: Ed Oswald, Freelance contributor\nEd is a technology journalist, music nut, and gadget geek who hails from the somewhat small town of Reading, Pennsylvania.\nRecent stories by Ed Oswald:\nStreaming Media\nSmart Home\nSmart Assistants\nHome Security\nHome Entertainment\nHeadphones\nNewsletter"

        "raw_content": "Our Top Lawn And Garden Tech Picks From CES 2024\nIt may not feel like it right now, but spring weather is just around the corner. For gardeners and landscapers, now is the perfect time to get a head start on seed starting and strategizing before planting season arrives. Still, as cathartic as the great outdoors can be, gardening and lawn maintenance can be a thorough workout for the mind and body. The right tools can make all the difference, and the latest innovations in lawn, garden, and pest control categories were all on display at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada. For those unfamiliar with the event, CES is the largest technology convention in the world \u2014 and virtually every category you can think of is represented through product showcases from exhibitors, including the latest crop of lawn and garden equipment and products.\nHouse Digest explored CES 2024 in search of the best gardening, landscaping, and pest control tools at the show, from The Rise Roma, a hydroponic indoor garden that can raise full-grown tomato plants year-round, to the Novabot, a mowing robot that drifts like a Roomba across your lawn. And a heads up if you hate mosquitos: The Mosqitter may put an end to your least favorite pest just in time for your next backyard barbecue. So, close out your spreadsheets and set down those seed packets \u2014 it's time to take a closer glimpse at some of the best lawn and garden products at CES 2024.\nMosqitter - The Grand\nIf you're anything like us, mosquitoes on your property can be the bane of your existence in the summer months. Whether you're gardening or kicking back on the patio, these irritating insects can quickly put a damper on your day-to-day activities \u2013 and lead to endless itching by nightfall. But the days of decrying the United States government's ban on the mosquito-killing agent DDT in 1972 (per the U.S. Environmental\u00a0Protection\u00a0Agency) are over, thanks to the Mosqitter. Founded by Anastasiia Romanova, Mosqitter is a woman-owned pest control line that features an original full-sized model, The Grand, as well as an upcoming compact release known as the Mini. Using a combination of light, heat, and a proprietary blend of pheromones to mimic our mammalian scent, Mosqitter's The Grand is able to eliminate up to 93% of mosquitos in a given area without harming beneficial insect populations such as bees and butterflies.\nCurrently, Mosqitter fans can purchase The Grand, the original large-scale device that can neutralize roughly two acres worth of pests at a time, ideal for expansive yards, wooded areas, and waterside properties. For those with smaller gathering spaces, the Mini is ideal \u2014 and this compact version is due to be released in the fall of 2024. But if you're hoping to cull the local mosquito population sooner, you're in for a treat. Through the month of January 2024, the Mosqitter Grand will be available with a $400 discount code off of its $1,999 MSRP (CES2024) through the Mosqitter website.\nRise Gardens - The Rise Roma\nFor many gardeners, enjoying perfectly ripe, fresh tomatoes is one of the best parts of the summer harvest. But what if you could pluck ripe heirloom tomatoes from the vine in the dead of winter? It may sound like a foreign concept to those in certain growing zones, but Rise Gardens has unveiled a groundbreaking hydroponic system to supply tomato lovers with their favorite crop year-round. The Rise Roma is the company's latest indoor gardening system, designed to accommodate the needs of mature tomato plants. Using handy grow pods and a water reservoir, even novice gardeners can produce a beautiful bounty of better garden tomatoes in the comfort of their homes.\nHouse Digest had the pleasure of viewing the Roma up close and can attest that these healthy plants were indistinguishable from your (literal) garden variety Roma tomato vines. Plus, even foodies who aren't very fond of tomatoes can utilize Rise Gardens' latest launch. Despite its name, The Rise Roma is also capable of growing a variety of larger crops, from pickling cucumbers to melons. Those interested in owning a Roma of their own may purchase it directly from Rise Gardens, where it retails for $1299 and is available in a Cloud (white) or Charcoal (black) finish. The company will ship the base Rise Gardens unit to get your plants started right away, and the first fleet of Roma growing extensions will ship to customers in March 2024.\nMammotion - Luba 2 AWD Series\nWhile wandering the show floor at CES, we came across some sharp-looking robots traipsing along an artificial lawn. Though they looked like something straight out of science fiction movie, it wasn't long before we realized these industrious movers were made for lawn mowing. According to the company's representatives, the Mammotion's Luba 2 AWD is a landscaping robot that can effortlessly scale sloped lawns for hours on a single charge. We watched them zip up and down a steep, 'grassy' hill many times with ease, affirming Mammotion's claims right before us. Chugging along terrain like a robot vacuum over the carpet, the Luba 2 moves around a designated area to clip grasses up to four inches in height before returning to its charging base when it needs more power.\u200b\nThe Luba AWD 2 also has several attractive features for homeowners and groundskeepers, including the option to produce customizable printed lawn-cutting designs. So, if you've been searching for a way to propose to that special someone \u2014 or irritate that pesky neighbor \u2014 we're sure you'll find a way to put it to good use beyond basic mowing needs. At the time of writing, the Luba AWD 2 series is currently available for pre-order in the United States through the Mammotion online storefront. Models range in price from the Luba 2 AWD 1000 at $2,178 to the Luba 2 AWD 10000 at $4,099. As an aside, those looking to try the device for less may be interested in the Luba 2's predecessor, the\u00a0Luba, with models starting at $1,749.\nNovabot - N1000 and N2000\nLike robot vacuums, there are many robot lawnmowers on the market, and CES is a great opportunity for companies to demonstrate how theirs stand out from the crowd. The Novabot is one of these devices, and it took up the challenge with its N1000 and N2000 robots. The N1000 comes with an 0.75-acre mowing range, while the higher-end N2000 can cover 1.5 acres. Mowing areas can be broken down into multiple zones, so the bot can target desired areas while preserving others. Exact cutting routes can be mapped out in advance, and the robot knows where the boundaries are, so a perimeter wire isn't needed.\nOne of Novabot's standout features is its obstacle detection system. A combination of LiDAR and AI means it can detect objects as small as a golf ball and adjust its path to avoid them. This will prevent damage to the objects themselves, and, of course, protect the rather expensive robot from harm. The Novabot is also safe for use around children and pets \u2014 the device is designed to steer clear of them and will stop moving entirely if they get too close. The main drawback is that both models will cost you a pretty penny, with the N1000 retailing for $2,899 and the N2000 for $3,399. On the upside, interested shoppers can save $800 during the month of January 2024 by purchasing their mower through the Novabot website with the code 'CES2024'.\nReencle Home Composter\nIf you're interested in turning food waste and other organic materials into a potent fertilizer, composting is hands-down the best option around. Still, composting can intimidate some home chefs and gardeners, thanks to unpleasant drawbacks like odors, gasses, and laboriousness. That's where Reencle comes in, a small home composter that can turn food waste into fertile soil within 24-hours. The greatest advantage of the Reencle is its odor-fighting design, which allows you to process leftover scraps indoors without compost's characteristic scent wafting throughout your home. The unit itself is also quite quiet and compact, making it even more desirable for indoor use.\nCompost explosions, another common concern, aren't a problem with this handy home and garden gadget. A rotating arm mixes the compost, aiding decomposition through fermentation and eliminating the chances of a pocket of methane forming in the pile while saving you the trouble of stirring it yourself. There's also a cost saving element at play, as garden fertilizer essentially becomes free by using the sustainable device. If you're ready to begin your home composting journey, you can purchase the Reencle through the company's online storefront, where it retails for $499 and is backed by a one-year warranty.\nAnu Aeroponics\nAeroponic gardens are an increasingly popular solution for home gardeners and chefs alike, and Anu is one of the most exciting grow systems we viewed at CES 2024. While it looks more akin to a modern art piece than a sustainable food source, Anu is a breathtaking innovation in the world of aeroponic gardening in more ways than one. Similar to Rise Gardens, users select grow pods from Anu's catalog to start rearing the indoor garden of their dreams. On top of that, even those without green thumbs can benefit from the Anu, thanks to AI integration that helps optimize growing conditions, supporting both the garden and its owner.\nYou may notice that Anu looks a bit different than other gardening systems of its kind. That's because it uses an ultra-efficient proprietary technology known as rotary aeroponics, allowing you to grow a plethora of healthy herbs, vegetables, and more directly next to one another. Not only is this an enormous benefit to those living in small spaces, but the strawberry planter-like design is mesmerizing once the plants are in full bloom. We couldn't take our eyes off the brilliant cherry tomatoes and lush, leafy herbs as they spun like a carousel under Anu's grow lights. At the moment, the Anu is still in development, though we can't wait to see more from this blossoming startup."

Wi-Fi-enabled and app-controlled, there's no guesswork involved. Featuring smart hydroponic technology, the New Rise Garden is self-watering and self-fertilizing, and the app will tell you exactly when to add nutrients and water, lets you manage lights and track your growing progress, and even tells you when it's time to harvest. The system also features an Alexa integration for voice control. And, unlike other indoor smart gardens on the market, Rise Gardens' IoT connectivity is available to all customers, not just subscribers. The system will be on display and demoed at Amazon's Experience Area in the Venetian.\nAlso unique to Rise Gardens is a nursery system and three-part nutrients and pH management products to ensure the best possible growing success.
