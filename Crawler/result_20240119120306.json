These plans bolster CommScope\u2019s ability to meet U.S. supply demands driven by federal initiatives to bring \u2018Internet For All\u2019 \u2013 including in underserved and rural broadband markets \u2013 and will also enhance production capacity over the next four years. Increased production and creation of at least 250 new jobs will align with demand driven from states throughout the U.S. as they begin to disburse Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) Program funding.\n\u201cBroadband for everyone is no longer a luxury, but rather a critical necessity to participate in today\u2019s society and economic market,\u201d stated Chuck Treadway, president and CEO, CommScope. \u201cWe have long been committed to supplying our partners with the solutions necessary to bring broadband to everyone. Furthering our long-standing relationship with the State of North Carolina is a great next step to bring \u2018Internet For All\u2019, and we are thrilled to work with the State on this endeavor. This partnership not only contributes to the economic prosperity of Catawba County but also furthers our commitment to meet the objectives of the BEAD program. This exciting expansion continues to shine a spotlight on Catawba County and North Carolina as the hub that supplies the nation with fiber cable.\u201d\nCommScope currently has the capacity to manufacture drop cable at a rate of approximately 2 billion feet per year in its U.S. facilities \u2013 a level of production that will allow states and their partners to connect every underserved American as a part of the BEAD program. The expansion will further allow CommScope to manufacture the necessary cable to enable service providers to deploy broadband across the U.S. Capacity increase will align around loose tube production and additional fiber cable counts and styles needed for rural deployment, including CommScope\u2019s HeliARC\u2122 fiber-optic cable. First announced in March, the HeliARC fiber-optic cable is specifically designed for rural fiber network architecture.\n\u201cConnecting every household in North Carolina to high-speed internet is going to take a lot of fiber, and with this expansion CommScope is answering the call not only with American jobs, but North Carolina jobs,\u201d\u00a0stated N.C. Governor Roy Cooper. \u201cWe appreciate CommScope\u2019s additional investment in Catawba County and their confidence in our workforce to improve the nation\u2019s fiber-optic infrastructure.\u201d\n\u201cWe are honored CommScope has chosen Catawba County from which to continue to manufacture the cutting-edge technologies that will help bring about \u2018Internet for All\u2019 across our state and nation,\u201d Randy Isenhower, chair of the Catawba County Board of Commissioners, remarked. \u201cAs a company, CommScope remains one of our community\u2019s greatest success stories from its entrepreneurial origin to its present Fortune 500 global enterprise. Their legacy and impact continue to grow with today\u2019s announcement.\u201d\n\u2014END\u2014\nCommScope and the CommScope logo are registered trademarks of CommScope and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and other countries.

        "raw_content": "Catawba County reinvents itself as high-tech manufacturing hub\nAppeared as a sponsored section from the May 2019 issue\nBy Julie Cunnane\nCatawba County\u2019s effort to reinvent itself as a high-tech manufacturing hub is coming into focus.\nDriving into Hickory off U.S. 321 North, a new public art sculpture of two giant leaves marks the entrance to the city \u2014 a first hint Hickory is turning over a new leaf.\nDowntown shops are bustling and the square is full of people on a bright Saturday afternoon. A family pushes a stroller and walks a little dog as they pass a light blue construction sign that reads: Future City Walk.\nThis 5.2-mile stretch, patterned after Little Sugar Creek in Charlotte, will eventually connect the campus of Lenoir-Rhyne University to downtown Hickory (phase one) and continue along Old Lenoir Road (phase two) to the Lake Hickory Riverfront (phase three) where visitors will find shopping, dining, a bridge walkway over the water and public access to the water.\nScott Millar, president of the Catawba County Economic Development Corp., says construction should start this summer. Work has begun on relocating utilities and water lines along Main Avenue.\nIt\u2019s one of the city\u2019s large infrastructure projects to increase the livability of Hickory and attract new businesses. And it\u2019s working.\n\u201cIn the past several years, there\u2019s been an uptick in the business buzz in Hickory,\u201d says City Manager Warren Wood.\n[media-credit name=\u201dCorning Optical Communications\u201d align=\u201dalignright\u201d width=\u201d500\u2033][/media-credit]\nIn addition to recent expansions by longtime Hickory businesses such as Corning Optical Communications, a new company is coming to town \u2014 Isotopen Technologien M\u00fcnchen AG, headquartered in Germany. The radiopharmaceutical company chose Catawba County for its first U.S. manufacturing facility.\n\u201cThe [Hickory] area is planning for and embracing expansion, which will help attract talent and keep adding to the quality of life that is key to recruiting and retaining a skilled workforce,\u201d a company representative says.\nThe city\u2019s hope is for other companies to follow and for residents, both old and new, to enjoy lifestyle and economic improvements.\nIn 1961, Hickory boasted 46 furniture plants, 89 hosiery mills and 27 other factories, according to From Tavern to Town: An Architectural History of Hickory, North Carolina.\nBut in the last 20 years, Catawba County towns have struggled as two recessions hit, and many companies took their production overseas.\n\u201cBack in 1993 when I started with the city,\u201d Wood says, \u201cabout 50% of all employment in the Hickory metro area was manufacturing. Today, it\u2019s about 25%.\u201d\nThat\u2019s because between 2000 and 2013, 45,000 jobs were lost. \u201cWe were hit about as hard as anybody,\u201d says Wood.\nNow, in the buildings that once housed mills, townspeople shop, eat and drink, attend festivals, and buy local food at the popular Famer\u2019s Market in Union Square, the city\u2019s central business district.\n\u201cThe Hickory people are a resilient kind,\u201d says Catawba County Chamber of Commerce President Lindsay Keisler.\nIn 2010, with a public plan called \u201cInspiring Spaces,\u201d city officials began to take steps to reinvent themselves and reinvigorate the economy. The plan outlined the city\u2019s goals: Investing in improvements to the livability of the area, upgrading office and industrial space to attract businesses, and improving educational opportunities for the workforce.\nToday, as these visions are coming to fruition, Hickory and neighboring towns in Catawba County are well positioned for growth, led by advanced manufacturing technologies.\n\u201cIn 2014, Hickory voters approved a $40 million bond referendum to create a variety of amenities that would allow us to attract and retain a workforce. Since then, we secured another $50 million toward those goals,\u201d Wood says.\nThe potential development around the greenway could, by 2035, result in about $500 million in private investment, 8,000 jobs created, 1,750 new housing units and a jump in population of 3,500, says Assistant to the City Manager Yaidee Fox, citing a study the city commissioned.\nThe Riverwalk, another portion of the Hickory Trail initiative, will offer more shopping, dining and recreational amenities at Lake Hickory, as well as residential development and connections to other future amenities.\nCharlotte firm LandDesign has been hired to plan Riverwalk.\n\u201cThat river district has a tremendous amount of potential. \u2026 The river is right there, the short line train is right there, and there is a tremendous amount of boating opportunity,\u201d says Wood, whose office is in conversation with the operator of the privately held 17-mile short line about a possible dinner train excursion.\nThat area already is a bit of a regional destination, thanks to a system of mountain-biking trails known as Lake Hickory Trails, near the future Riverwalk. The Hickory Velo Club and the Rock N Road bicycle shop support a vibrant mountain-biking community.\n\u201cHickory tends to be the hub of the metro statistical area,\u201d says Tim Bolick of the Catawba EDC. The MSA includes Catawba, Caldwell, Alexander and Burke counties.\nAnother infrastructure project is covered by an N.C. Department of Transportation $650 million plan, a portion of which will be used to convert U.S. 321 to a \u201csuperstreet\u201d between U.S. 70 and Lenoir in Caldwell County, allowing easier traffic flow for an estimated 45,000 cars a day.\nFox adds that a $17 million federal grant will fund creation of a pedestrian bridge over the superstreet connecting the western parts of the city \u00ad\u2014 including the baseball stadium and airport \u2014 to the Riverwalk.\nThese projects will increase the lifestyle attractiveness of the whole region and enhance recruiting efforts for other economic opportunities.\nBig companies have already found Catawba County attractive. Apple and Bed, Bath & Beyond have data centers in Catawba County, Bolick says.\n\u201cWe\u2019re a mini-Silicon Valley with all the technology-related industry we have,\u201d Wood says, explaining that data centers need two things: power and water. Catawba County has plenty of both.\nHickory provides water to Apple\u2019s data center in Maiden. \u201cHere we say, \u2018Siri lives in Catawba County,\u2019\u201d Wood says.\nAlso in motion is the upgrading and modernization of local business parks and industrial areas to better support the advanced technology needs that today\u2019s industries require.\nAt Trivium Corp. Center, Corning Optical Communications is expanding. Additional work is being done to prepare for incoming company ITM\u2019s manufacturing facility.\nTransportation Insight, the second-largest privately held company in North Carolina, considered relocating. But it decided to stay downtown because of the planned City Walk and invested more money into its corporate campus, Wood says.\nOther companies headquartered downtown are CornerStone United, Hickory Springs Manufacturing Co. and Merchants Distributors Inc. These companies have long histories in Hickory and have been supportive of the community.\n\u201cOur downtown hasn\u2019t seen a remodel [like this] since the \u201980s,\u201d Wood says. \u201cWhat we have planned is really going to improve the area, and we are excited.\u201d\n\u201cWe are trying to reinvent our community and keep young people here,\u201d says former City Councilwoman Sally Fox, who served 20 years on the panel. During her tenure, she always worked to keep downtown relevant. \u201cIn [the] 1990s, we started a farmers market in downtown after the only grocery store there moved.\u201d\nMuch larger now, the farmers market is still located in Union Square and is open twice a week seasonally.\nFox lives near downtown within walking distance of her gift boutique, The Sally Co. She believes ring neighborhoods are a healthy support system for a downtown.\n\u201cThat was one best part of being on council \u2026 neighborhood development,\u201d Fox says.\nLivability is a relevant draw for companies looking to relocate. The city wants to continue to support a vibrant downtown district for young adults and families wanting to live, work and play there.\nAmenities and services abound for this community of more than 40,000 people. The region is home to two top-notch health care providers, Frye Regional Medical Center and Catawba Valley Medical Center.\nFrye Regional Medical Center is opening a brain center in April led by neurosurgeon Akram Mahoud, with several locations covering various brain specialties including sports medicine, family physicians for brain care, a psychiatry group and an inpatient behavioral health hospital. The community can now access care previously unavailable nearby for strokes, brain trauma or tumors, and many other neurological conditions.\nPatrick Broos, director of supply chain for Catawba Valley Medical Center, says that the system is one of the most collaborative he\u2019s seen, having worked at four others in the U.S.\nCVMC has a 258-bed acute-care facility and urgent-care facilities in addition to more than 25 primary or specialty practices.\n\u201cWithin Catawba County and all the municipalities here, there seems to be so much collaboration with education, business, and government working together \u2026 making Hickory and Catawba County sustainable for the future,\u201d Broos says. \u201cIt\u2019s a unique environment that my wife and I are excited about, particularly for our kids as they grow.\u201d\nThe Catawba Science Center and Hickory\u2019s aquarium are a part of the Science, Art and Literature, Together initiative that includes a community symphony, choral society, art museum and united arts council. The town operates its own 40,000-square-foot library near downtown.\nHickory\u2019s small-town community feel was highlighted last year in National Geographic Travel magazine\u2019s list for \u201cBest Small Cities for 2018.\u201d\nPopulation is growing as building permits for single-family homes increased more than 19% from 2016-18. There are 1,000 apartment units being built, and the average number of days a home is on the market is 45.\n\u201cWe\u2019re in a really good place,\u201d Wood says. \u201cAnd it\u2019s nice to be able to say that.\u201d\nHickory is in a good place geographically too. About 55 miles northwest of Charlotte, the city is 45 minutes from the Blue Ridge Parkway with Interstate 40 running east to west and U.S. 321 running north to south.\nWhen ITM was researching locations for a new facility, Hickory competed with other cities. Because of the short shelf life of the company\u2019s cancer-fighting product, being within an hour of an international airport was a deciding factor.\n\u201cHickory\u2019s location relative to Charlotte was attractive to us; it is a good balance between proximity to an urban setting [and] the benefits of a small-town setting with a strong sense of community,\u201d a company representative says.\nBy late 2021, the company projects to be fully operational with 137 employees.\nAs Hickory\u2019s economy grows, businesses are looking for quality workers.\nHKY4Vets is a collaborative program that offers introduction to Hickory and its business opportunities to groups of veterans transitioning back to civilian life every year.\nVeteran Billy Rickles found the employment he was seeking through an open house and job fair sponsored by the program after moving from Florida. Rickles was hired at Western Piedmont Council of Governments to start a code enforcement division. \u201cIt felt like a perfect fit,\u201d Rickles says.\nBy January, he was up and running with a mobile office. After three months, the department added other services including enforcing rules for discharges to sewer systems and American Disability Association compliance.\nRickles says the people at HKY4Vets worked hard to connect him with quality employers based on his career goals.\nHickory native Lindsay Keisler earned a business degree at UNC Charlotte and returned to her hometown to work with the Catawba Chamber of Commerce in membership. Nine years later as CEO, Keisler believes in a business-friendly climate that creates jobs for residents.\n\u201cThe pursuit of value and relevance is everyday,\u201d Keisler says on the Supportedly podcast aimed at encouraging entrepreneurship.\nThe Edison Project is the region\u2019s only entrepreneurial competition. \u201cWe have done this for eight years, and it has helped to grow our businesses in the four-county area,\u201d Keisler says. \u201cWe award $18,000 in seed money to the top three finalists.\u201d\n\u201cWe have historically had an entrepreneurial spirit here in Hickory,\u201d Wood says. He adds that several homegrown businesses survived challenges and are hitting their strides again, such as Sherrill Furniture, Century Furniture and Hickory Springs Manufacturing.\nExecutive Director Dan St. Louis says the key to his work at Manufacturing Solutions Center is, well, solutions. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who solves the problem, it just matters that the problem gets solved.\u201d\nMSC\u2019s mission has always been to keep manufacturing in the U.S. \u201cCollaboration is key,\u201d says St. Louis, who has been with the center since its inception in 1990. \u201cEveryone working together.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a theme heard often when talking with people from Catawba County.\nMSC offers testing and prototype development services for textile and furniture companies nationally. It is also involved in the development and commercialization of products by supporting four incubator companies whose innovative ideas are contributing to the entrepreneurial spirit in Hickory.\nOne such company is Textile-Based Delivery Inc., led by Jordan Shindler. The proprietary biomaterial it makes can be used to embed medicinal ingredients into fabrics that are released into the body of the wearer.\nCharlotte entrepreneur Mich\u00e8le Dal Cin also partnered with the MSC to develop product lines for her company, Benefic LLC.\n\u201cI started with a Hosiery 101 class offered by the MSC,\u201d says Dal Cin, who works with Mark Bess at Yu Apparel, an incubator company whose products are made with U.S. yarns.\n\u201cIt\u2019s all about quality for us,\u201d Bess says. \u201cWe find that if we put American-made yarns in our product, they will last twice as long.\u201d\nDal Cin says she enjoys working locally because she can personally oversee production and testing \u2014 something she couldn\u2019t do if she outsourced to China.\n\u201cThat\u2019s been a huge advantage in working with the MSC companies,\u201d says Dal Cin. \u201cThey are there to support the development of business here in North Carolina.\u201d\nThe MSC and Bess also connected Dal Cin to other local business partners, from a Raleigh-based designer to a Conover-based packaging company.\n\u201cSomething that sets us apart as a community and a true competitive advantage is collaboration,\u201d Keisler says. Other collaborative efforts support a growing need for the highly skilled workforce that advanced technologies manufacturers are seeking.\n\u201cWe just had a ribbon-cutting for a game changer for us \u2014 the Workforce Solutions Complex at the Catawba Valley Community College campus. It\u2019s an 80,000-square-foot facility that will train high-tech workers, both in the technical side and the industrial side.\u201d Wood says.\nThe CVCC complex will serve an additional 1,500 students for the technical skills education called for by local employers. The center is the result of a collaboration among three public schools with support of the county commissioners.\n\u201cThis is a niche in the marketplace to facilitate [our] manufacturing orientation. And it really does appeal to people that we\u2019re recruiting,\u201d Millar says.\nHe explains that companies looking at Catawba County often ask, \u201cHow do I get the people to make the product?\u201d\n\u201cThis [new complex] really answers that workforce question in a way that really nobody else in North Carolina is attacking as strongly,\u201d Millar says.\nAs \u201cHome of the Makers and Doers,\u201d Hickory is crafting a future too.\nClick here to see a PDF of the section\nEntrepreneurs revitalize advanced manufacturing\nN.C. health care leaders discuss myriad challenges\nOpinion: Nimbleness allows media entities to continue\nWestRock to close Lexington plant, lay off 153\nBaseball stadium in Leland off the table \u2014 for now\nNorth Carolina\u2019s \u2018Battery Belt\u2019 booms with new factories\nWood pellet giant Enviva skips bond payment\nEmail Address\nFirst Name\nLast Name\nCONTACT US:\n\u00a9 Copyright 2024 Business North Carolina.
