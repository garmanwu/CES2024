        "raw_content": "Sci-Tech Trends\nNingbo will devolve 102 municipal authorities to the Ningbo Area of Zhejiang Pilot Free Trade Zone next year. Involving 11 departments, this is going to be the largest delegation of municipal authority in the history of Ningbo, which will give the Ningbo Area even greater reform autonomy. With that, how to further enhance the core competitiveness of the free trade zone has become the key proposition of Ningbo in the next step.\nInnovative Achievements\nGet Recognized\nIn 2013, Shanghai Pilot Free Trade Zone was established. At that time, Ningbo, a large open-economy city, a nationally leading manufacturing town, and the world's largest port, was also looking forward to having one. Later on, when the Zhejiang Pilot Free Trade Zone became the first FTZ in the country to expand, three new areas: Hangzhou, Ningbo, Jinhua-Yiwu were listed. Since then, Ningbo has been resolved to seize the expansion dividend.\nOver the past year, focusing on the functional positioning, development planning, and enterprise demands of the free trade zone, Ningbo has strengthened the exploration of the pioneering and differentiated system and formed the \"3+7+10+20\" innovation achievement system.\nAmong them, Ningbo cases, such as \"remote port state control inspections\" of arriving foreign ships, \"three-in-one\" reform of maritime adjudication, and the new mechanism of bulk commodity trading and financing, were successfully selected as the top 30 institutional innovation cases in the province. Ten landmark achievements, including the industrial community integrated management service model, were regarded as \"first in China\" innovations. A total of 20 reform measures, such as Chinese non-five-star ship coastal piggy-back business, were selected into the top seven batches of ten landmark achievements in the province.\nPort, shipping, and trade are interdependent and mutually reinforcing. Many measures adopted by the Ningbo Area were brand new in China and have brought real trade convenience to enterprises. For example, through the innovative mechanism of \"Remote Port State Control Inspections\" for arriving foreign ships, the integration of traffic flow organization is implemented to effectively reduce the cost of waiting for ships and the occupation of dock and anchorage resources. It is estimated that the mechanism, which helped to effectively avoid ship deportment and production schedule changes, had reduced the average waiting time of a single ship by 10%, significantly improving the efficiency of port clearance.\nRecently, at the Conference on the High-quality Promotion of the China (Zhejiang) Pilot Free Trade Zone, the achievements of institutional innovations in the Ningbo Area were again welcomed by the provincial authorities.\nContinually Enhancing\nCore Competitiveness\nLast September, the Planning of China (Zhejiang) Pilot Free Trade Zone Extended Areas was released. According to the Planning, Ningbo will assume the strategic function positioning of \"one hub, three centers and one demonstration zone\" with a 46 square kilometer test area. Hence, to build an oil and gas resource allocation center is becoming the first of the \"three centers\".\nOil and gas industries are the biggest feature of Zhejiang Free Trade Zone. From \"an oil and gas resource allocation center\" to \"a whole industry chain of oil and gas\", Ningbo area will further improve the openness and better serve the national strategy.\nNingbo proposes to adhere to the synergistic development and misalignment with Zhoushan, accelerate the construction of international oil and gas resource allocation center, strengthen the green petrochemical industry cluster, accelerate the gathering of international oil giants and famous oil service companies, build a powerful digital energy trade platform, significantly increase the storage volume and trading scale of oil and gas and chemicals, strive to become a globally influential oil and gas and chemicals distribution center, pricing center and standard-setting center, and provide more powerful support for national energy security and primary product supply.\nAt the same time, a number of key foreign investment projects in Ningbo were speeded up. In October, the \"Matheson International Energy Trade Headquarters Project\" was signed in Ningbo. Matheson Energy (Ningbo) will build the first domestic LPG Internet of Things sales platform in the Ningbo area, and strive to become the world's largest LPG comprehensive operator by 2025 with an annual trade volume exceeding 100 billion yuan and import and export volume exceeding 30 billion yuan.\n\"We will take this project as an opportunity to rely on our existing industrial foundation and the latest policies of investment and trade liberalization and facilitation in the FTZ to speed up the development of 'industry + trade' and help with the initiative of becoming a new international energy trade center in Ningbo,\" remarked by the head of the company.\nLooking Forward to Higher\nQuality Development\nAt the foot of Fenghuang mountain in Beilun, in where was a parking lot of Harbor Park, a CBD of Free Trade Zone will be built, which will become the key platform for \"promoting innovation and entrepreneurship in emerging industries such as headquarters economy, industrial Internet, 5G+ and digital economy\" in the Ningbo Area of China (Zhejiang) Pilot Free Trade Zone.\nTo pursue higher quality, Ningbo needs to explore new drivers and foster new concepts. Especially in areas that reflect core competencies, the Ningbo Area needs to take the lead in planning.\nWith a focus on new material science innovation centers and intelligent manufacturing demonstration areas, which will be propelled by digital industrialization and industrial digitalization, the Ningbo Area continues to promote the deep integration of digital technology and real economy, highlighting the development of key materials and equipment.\nTo build a clustered area of R&D in new functional materials, the Ningbo Area has successively introduced five high-level scientific innovation platforms, such as the Ningbo Research Institute of BUAA, becoming home to more than 30 new material projects. They will help to further improving the level of new material research and development and cultivating advanced manufacturing clusters and characteristic industrial chains of rare earth magnetic materials industry.\nWe can continue to expect more breakthroughs. The Ningbo Area emphasizes the development of electronic information materials, high-end magnetic materials, and electronic chemical materials. For instance, the Chuanbi Island High-Performance New Chemical Materials Industry Project, with a total investment of 33 billion yuan, was recently finalized and hosted by the Ningbo Area."

        "raw_content": "App\nFor Zhou Yuhan, a senior manager with CNOOC Zhejiang Ningbo LNG Co Ltd, what amazed him most was the high efficiency and superb business environment his company witnessed in Ningbo area of Zhejiang free trade zone, especially during the construction of his company's recently launched bonded LNG warehouse, the first one of its kind in Zhejiang.\n\"It took only eight months between our first application and the final acceptance test of the warehouse. It's really amazing and stunning speed,\" Zhou said.\nChina (Zhejiang) Free Trade Pilot Zone in Zhejiang province has been making great efforts to further liberalize trade in the area as well as promote common prosperity and integration of the Yangtze River Delta region.\nThe zone was expanded last year after receiving approval from the State Council to add Ningbo, Hangzhou and Jinhua-Yiwu areas to its existing Zhoushan area.\nFirst set up in Zhoushan in 2017, the zone back then was made up of both inland and waterside areas covering 119.95 square kilometers. Last year, Zhejiang FTZ doubled its size when the three new areas were added.\nIn the first half, Zhejiang FTZ added 24,827 market entities, up 100.7 percent year-on-year, accounting for 8.6 percent of the newly added market entities in the province, and contributing 11.4 percent to the province's foreign investment.\nSimilar yet differentiated responsibilities\nCurrently, the four areas in Zhejiang FTZ are tasked with different development goals.\nZhoushan area has been forming a complete industrial chain for the oil and gas industry. Ningbo area focuses on the development of oil and gas, new materials, international shipping, global supply chains, foreign trade and intelligent manufacturing.\nHangzhou area has been accelerating the development of the digital economy, and Jinhua-Yiwu area has been building up a new international trade center.\nTake Hangzhou area, for example. It has attracted 97 projects with a combined investment of 75.4 billion yuan ($11.61 billion) over the past year, including six projects invested by Global Fortune 500 companies.\nThe new factory of Hangzhou Panasonic (Comprehensive Bonded Zone) Co Ltd was the first Global Fortune 500 project to break ground in Hangzhou area, with construction beginning in June this year.\nWith a total investment of 300 million yuan, the 2-hectare smart home appliance manufacturing factory is expected to be put into operation in April next year and generate nearly 8 billion yuan in production value in five years.\nIt is the attractive preferential policies and favorable business environment in Hangzhou area that have attracted so much investment.\nThe clustering of market entities has also laid a foundation for more preferential policies becoming available.\nGiven that more companies involved in the biomedical industry have settled in the area, Hangzhou published measures in July to support the industry in pharmaceutical research and development, as well as overseas sales, which will be first implemented in Hangzhou area.\n\"Ningbo area, since its launch, has witnessed the landing of 35 major projects, with a total investment of 23.58 billion yuan, and we have worked around the clock to secure our position in project introduction and facilitation,\" said Zhang Yan, director of the Office of Free Trade Zone in Ningbo.\nBy the end of August, 66 major projects have been put into use in Ningbo area of the China (Zhejiang) Pilot Free Trade Zone.\nThe projects were mainly involved in sectors like shipping logistics, smart warehousing, cross-border e-commerce, digital platforms and financial services.\nTheir operations are expected to generate more than 200 billion yuan ($30.77 billion) in annual revenue, while also bolstering the area's drive to become an internationally influential oil and gas resource distribution center.\nOver the past year, Zhejiang FTZ has introduced more than 40 preferential policies in terms of finance, taxation, talent and other areas to facilitate reform and opening-up while the four areas are being developed with different goals.\nFor example, Zhejiang Petroleum and Chemical Co is the country's only private enterprise to be qualified to import and export raw petroleum, refined oil products and low-sulfur oil when it was approved to import 14 million metric tons of raw petroleum and export 2 million tons of refined oil products and 390,000 tons of low-sulfur marine fuel oil in December.\nThe zone's Hangzhou area reformed the cross-border retail supply chain by integrating cross-border retail imports with product processing, which enables suppliers to process their products in the bonded area. Due to the system, PT Swift, a brand of edible bird's nests, built a production line in Hangzhou area last year. It can import raw materials from Malaysia, then process directly in the factory after receiving an order and the freshly stewed products will be delivered to consumers the next day.\nNingbo area was the first to join the Qualified Foreign Limited Partner (QFLP) program in the province last year, which encourages foreign investors to get involved in domestic equity investment programs.\nSome reforms in Zhejiang FTZ have been promoted in other cities across the country.\nThe reform in the entry and exit supervision of international ships by Zhoushan area was recognized as one of the best practices by the Ministry of Commerce, which improves the efficiency of international ships entering and leaving the port. The online business mediation platform launched by Hangzhou area was selected as one of the best practices in pilot service trade innovation programs by the State Council, the country's Cabinet.\nSo far, Zhejiang FTZ has launched 102 major projects, involving a total of 358 billion yuan in investments.\nFurther on, Zhejiang is planning to develop the FTZ into a demonstration zone for the development of the digital economy. According to the plan, the demonstration zone initially includes the entirety of Hangzhou, the first comprehensive cross-border e-commerce pilot area in the country, and later adds Ningbo and Jinhua in 2021 and 2022, respectively.\nJinhua-Yiwu, Ningbo and Zhoushan areas are jointly building up the Yiwu-Ningbo-Zhoushan corridor, which will become an economic powerhouse that helps form a new trade mode of small and bulk commodities.\nPromote common prosperity\n\"Building Zhejiang into a demonstration zone for achieving prosperity asks for the interconnected development between areas in Zhejiang FTZ,\" noted Hu Zhenfang, deputy director of the Zhejiang Provincial Department of Commerce.\nTo stimulate the development of surrounding areas in Zhejiang province, six interconnected innovation areas, including Hangzhou, Ningbo, Wenzhou, Jiaxing, Jinhua and Taizhou, were approved by the Zhejiang provincial government in 2019.\nThe second batch of interconnected innovation areas was announced in June, including Huzhou, Shaoxing, Quzhou and Lishui.\nCopyright\u00a9 www.gov.cn | About us | Contact us\nWebsite Identification Code bm01000001\nRegistration Number: 05070218\nAll rights reserved.

One may get the country of origin and date of arrival of imported products through scanning the code, which can ensure the \u201ctraceable origin, integrated data, available credit, and guaranteed quality\u201d. Since 2010, Ningbo Free Trade Zone has been investing special funds for operation and maintenance of the anti-counterfeiting traceability platform.\nThe promotion of the anti-counterfeiting and traceability QR codes has provided benefits for imported goods enterprises in the region. Tan Qiuju, Deputy Manager of the Marketing Department of Ningbo Ningxing Youbei Logistics Co., Ltd., told the reporter that the company only received a single consultation about the traceability QR code. \u201cUp to now, the sales volume on an e-commerce platform has reached more than 27 million orders this year, being doubled compared with that in 2018; the sales volume has been increasing year by year, but the number of complaints has been decreasing.\u201d\nIn order to further enhance the consumer confidence, the consumer rights protection agencies in 20 cities (districts and counties) in Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Shanghai signed the Cooperation Agreement on the Establishment of a Coordination Mechanism for Safeguarding the Protection of Consumers\u2019 Rights of Imported Goods in the Yangtze River Delta Region in March this year, which is also the first cross-regional collaboration mechanism specifically for the protection of consumers\u2019 rights of imported goods in China.\nShortly before the interview, the Consumer Protection Commission of Market Supervision Bureau, Ningbo Free Trade Zone received a complaint about the after-sales dispute to a cross-border e-commerce enterprise, which has established a complete green channel for the protection of consumers\u2019 rights under the agreement; therefore, with the mediation of the Consumer Protection Commission, the complaint was successfully resolved within five working days.\nAs reported, the Consumer Protection Commission of Market Supervision Bureau, Ningbo Free Trade Zone would accept about 300 cross-border e-commerce complaints each year before 2018. At the end of 2017, there was one cross-border e-commerce complaint per 100,000 orders, which, however, has been reduced to four per 10 million orders.\nFollowing the principle of \u201cquality first\u201d, Ningbo Free Trade Zone has implemented a series of strict product quality control measures, such as anti-counterfeiting and traceability QR codes and the mechanism of the protection of consumers\u2019 rights, which have helped cross-border e-commerce enterprises in Ningbo Free Trade Zone to realize the cumulative import volume of over RMB 100 billion.\nSong Yuchi, Party Secretary and Director of the Free Trade Zone (Export Processing Zone), Ningbo Market Supervision Administration expressed that \u201cthe FTZ has been providing better protection for cross-border e-commerce consumers, and can timely and efficiently deal with any problem or doubt about the products; there will be no worries, and all the consumers can be assured to consume.\u201d (Reporters: Fan Xiaolei and Cai Xiaoxin, Correspondent: Zhang Aitao)"

The price of the goods totals around RMB 194,000 and will be shipped from Ningbo to Amazon Warehouse in the United States.\nNingbo Customs, based on the characteristics of the Ningbo area of the Zhejiang Pilot Free Trade Zone, has rolled out a list of 15 tasks for 2023 centering on digital reform, striving to shape iconic achievements with Zhejiang characteristics.\n\u201cWith numerous policy dividends and better port business environment, Ningbo Customs will stand firm in the Ningbo area, strengthen regional linkage, deepen the innovation of customs supervision system in the pilot free trade zone, and create an optimal business environment to fully support the construction of the Zhejiang Pilot Free Trade Zone,\u201d said Hu Danchun, Deputy Director of the Free Trade Department of Ningbo Customs.\nThe innovative supervision mode of \"inspection before shipment\" for LCL goods of export has been well-received by enterprises for its pilot application in cross-border E-commerce exports. \u201cThrough extensive investigation and careful studies, a list of 15 tasks for 2023 has been formed from four dimensions: striving for replication and promotion nationwide, striving for the filing of innovative measures, focusing on promotion and integrating innovation,\u201d according to Chen Kaiyan, Chief of the Comprehensive Department of the Free Trade Department of Ningbo Customs.\nSince Ningbo saw the successful pilot application of the first batch of export overseas location in the special area in January 2020, Ningbo Customs has kept optimizing policy supply and started to apply the innovative supervision mode of \"inspection before shipment\" for LCL goods of export to forward warehouse of cross-border E-commerce export this year. This model \u201cpreposes\u201d a collection and distribution center at domestic ports to exert the functions of export goods storage of cross-border E-commerce, customs inspection and LCL shipment for faster goods turnover.\nNingbo Yaji Logistics Co., Ltd., a logistics provider for global export of Amazon, was the first beneficiary of innovative regulation of Ningbo Customs. \u201cOur export goods of cross-border E-commerce can be inspected and shipped in just one day at a lower cost, which took us 2 to 3 days in the past,\u201d said Li Feng, head of the company.\nNingbo Customs will cast its eyes over the development of the Zhejiang Pilot Free Trade Zone this year to further summarize its construction experience and achievements, while making pilot evaluations on its four new measures that have been registered with the General Administration of Customs of the PRC to enhance the depth and breadth of innovation. Also, it has put forward two new initiatives of \"inspection before shipment for LCL goods of export\u201d and \"new sampling and supervision mode for imported foods\" based on bottlenecks and development needs faced by ports and industries in the city, to strive for more first pilot projects nationwide to be launched in Ningbo. Additionally, Ningbo Customs will focus on project leadership and key breakthroughs, closely combine with the Ningbo area to build an international center for energy and chemical resource allocation, import more characteristic commodities from Central and Eastern European countries, and make explorations and innovations in bonded supervision of liquid chemicals, bonded mixed mining of non-ferrous metals, and merchandise import from Central and Eastern European countries.\nFurther, Ningbo Customs will deeply explore Ningbo's strengths in shipping logistics at ports and smart manufacturing to cultivate emerging industries, strengthen competitive industries, and present achievements in the construction of a free trade pilot zone with Ningbo characteristics, by means of 9 initiatives including supporting the import of raw materials in the new energy industry, promoting pilot projects for new marine fuel refueling, optimizing the import process of bulk commodities, creating a national hub for NEV exports, unblocking the import and export channels for automotive parts, and navigating the construction of a smart comprehensive bonded zone.\nThe pilot of container-based NEV export is a typical scenario of turning Ningbo Zhoushan Port to a national hub for NEV export. This innovation highlights the characteristics of Meishan Port and explores the pilot \"one-stop\" supervision of container-based NEV export, cutting the customs clearance period by 2 to 3 days and the cost by about RMB 800 to 1,000 per container. The effort, together with roll on/roll off shipment, has become a \"dual channel\" for NEV export, recording the export volume of 2,754 vehicles in 1,749 TEUs in the first quarter at Ningbo Port.
