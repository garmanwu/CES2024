Valeo SCALA\u2122\u00a03 offers advanced perception in all conditions, meeting the highest automotive industry quality and safety standards.\nLiDAR is proving an essential component of autonomous vehicle systems enabling vehicles to spot and react to obstacles in their environment that other sensing systems struggle with.\nFind out more\nValeo INEEZ\u2122 Air charging: Never worry again about charge cables\nCharging using cables, particularly in shared public spaces, can be a real headache. However, there is an alternative solution. The new Valeo Ineez\u2122 Air Charging system offers an efficient and lightweight solution to recharge a vehicle inductively, without any charge cables.\nValeo Ineez\u2122 Air Charging is the only wireless solution that uses an ultra low operating frequency, around\u00a03kHz, offering a lighter, simpler and safer charging experience.\nThe Valeo Ineez\u2122 Air Charging is compatible with all wallboxes available on the market today and supports charging for autonomous vehicles that can just drive themselves onto an inductive charging area.\nValeo Predict4Range: Our software solution to range anxiety\nManaging battery and motor temperature as well as maintaining optimal cabin conditions for passengers efficiently are key to maximizing range and battery life without compromising comfort. Valeo Predict4Range software predicts and drives the most efficient thermal management strategies for extended driving range (i.e. less charging stops with faster charging operations), and extended battery lifespan. The software integrates real-time data like outside temperature, wind speed, charging station maps, road elevation and electric vehicle parameters and offers up to\u00a024% more range in real conditions compared to traditional thermal management control.\nValeo Predict4Range also takes into account daily vehicle usage and can use additional parameters, such as routes, driving behavior and habits to precisely calculate and optimize energy consumption.\nValeo smart battery immersive cooling system: Unlocking the full potential of EVs\nValeo\u2019s smart immersive battery cooling system combines an efficient dielectric fluid with a smart hydraulic architecture to improve overall performance of electric vehicles in terms of safety, efficiency, speed of charge , longevity and reduced environmental impact.\nValeo\u2019s smart immersive battery cooling system reduces charging time by\u00a030% thanks to perfect cells\u2019 cooling and preheating when needed in winter or reduces the average compressor consumption on a whole driving cycle of\u00a05% to\u00a08% compared to current best-in-class battery coolers for a given charging speed.\nAlso, the large structural modules that embed the fluid are made of Valeo OrganoSheet material, which provides robust mechanical crash protection and is as light as aluminum but 50%\u00a0less carbon intensive.\nValeo ImagIn: Enjoy an immersive sound and light experience in your car!\nValeo and Sennheiser Mobility have combined their expertise to develop a unique multisensorial exploration where light meets an immersive sound audio system to create the illusion of a sound stage around each passenger, transforming every ride into a breathtaking soundscape.\nThe Valeo ImagIn interior lighting system is composed of projection modules, smart adaptable user-interfaces and software dedicated to projection and content management. Valeo ImagIn combines visual projected content with smart surfaces and sound for an immersive and intuitive experience for all passengers.\nZeekr 007: A personalized lighting experience for premium EVs\nA CES 2023 Innovation Awards and a finalist for the 2024 Automotive News PACE awards.

Using Valeo existing sensors and software, we create tailor-made solutions for gaming, relaxing or more global entertainment.\nValeo and BMW teleoperation parking maneuvers: park cars safely from miles away\nUsing cameras already in series production and relying on Valeo\u2019s V-Cloud secure platform, this solution developed with BMW gives a real-time live view of the surroundings and interior of the car, enabling teleoperation from a cockpit with high reliability. The ability to operate a vehicle safely and remotely has been developed for fleet management with use cases in automaker factories and for robotaxi companies.\nThermal camera with new partner FLIR: the world\u2019s smallest and most sensitive automotive grade night vision camera\nThe thermal camera is a key enabler to extend the detection of vulnerable road users, animals, vehicles and road edges in all driving conditions: day, night, sun and headlamps glare, fog, smoke, snow, rain or dust storm. Fusion of the long wave infrared sensed detail with the visible light domain improves visualization for the driver and, coupled with other sensors such as LiDAR or Radar, provides enhanced feature detection capability in challenging scenarios and higher speeds.\nFrom ADAS to ARAS: Valeo\u2019s solution for the safety of all riders\nValeo will present a smartphone app based on our expertise in computer vision and AI.
