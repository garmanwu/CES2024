This dedication to giving investors a trading advantage led to the creation of our proven Zacks Rank stock-rating system. Since 1988 it has more than doubled the S&P 500 with an average gain of +24.04%\nper year. These returns cover a period from January 1, 1988 through December 4, 2023. Zacks Rank stock-rating system returns are computed monthly based on the beginning of the month and end of the month Zacks Rank stock prices plus any dividends received during that particular month. A simple, equally-weighted average return of all Zacks Rank stocks is calculated to determine the monthly return. The monthly returns are then compounded to arrive at the annual return. Only Zacks Rank stocks included in Zacks hypothetical portfolios at the beginning of each month are included in the return calculations. Zacks Ranks stocks can, and often do, change throughout the month. Certain Zacks Rank stocks for which no month-end price was available, pricing information was not collected, or for certain other reasons have been excluded from these return calculations.\nVisit Performance Disclosure for information about the performance numbers displayed above.\nVisit www.zacksdata.com to get our data and content for your mobile app or website.\nReal time prices by BATS.\u00a0Delayed quotes by FIS.\nNYSE and AMEX data is at least 20 minutes delayed.

Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too.

Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power.

The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable.

It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024.

It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use.

The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

Through the adoption of Vuzix\u2019s waveguide technology and optical display components, Quanta is set to engage in mass production for smart glasses, with shipments expected to commence in 2024.\nThe\u00a0contract manufacturer\u00a0like\u00a0Quanta\u00a0has been strengthening its technical capabilities in the VR and AR domains in recent years, aiming to possess the capacity to provide comprehensive product solutions and seize opportunities in the flourishing virtual market.\nTrendForce\u2019s Insights:\nIn recent years, Quanta has actively invested in the AR glasses sector, including collaborative efforts with STMicroelectronics in late 2020 to develop a reference design for AR glasses and a $20 million investment in the Israeli AR startup Lumus in 2021.\nThe ongoing partnership with Vuzix, planning for complete device shipments, underscores Quanta\u2019s optimistic outlook on the application development and future business opportunities for AR glasses.\nGiven Quanta\u2019s key product and service areas spanning mobile computing, home entertainment, IoT, and smart manufacturing, the current trend of the metaverse positions VR and AR devices as crucial gateways to enter and add value to these domains.\nWith Quanta transitioning from a device supplier to a platform service provider and implementing a comprehensive development strategy of hardware-software integration, the continued focus on AR glasses holds the potential to expand profit margins for Quanta.\nVuzix, in collaboration with Quanta, has secured a prominent position in the VR and AR device market through its wearable display technology. Notably, Vuzix has developed the world\u2019s first Micro LED AR glasses and consistently received CES Innovation Awards from 2020 to the present year.\nTheir product highlights encompass AR technology for swim goggles, the establishment of a comprehensive smart glasses platform featuring microLED and waveguide technologies. The recently unveiled Ultralite S, focused on sports and fitness scenarios, seamlessly integrates with smartphones or smartwatches to display real-time activity data and information on the glasses, earning it the CES 2024 Innovation Award.\nWith Vuzix possessing critical optical technology and components across a broad product range, the collaboration aligns well with Quanta\u2019s AR transformation, particularly enhancing Quanta\u2019s QOCA telemedicine cloud platform in the medical field. The synergy between the two marks a harmonious and mutually beneficial partnership.\nIn addition to Quanta, various contract manufacturers\u00a0have been actively enhancing their technological capabilities in the VR and AR industry through collaborations, mergers, and investments. Notably, Foxconn\u00a0has been investing in and collaborating with key players in the VR and AR device market since 2022, including XRSPACE, Varjo, and the early part of 2023 with Jorjin.\nLooking at other contract manufacturers, GoerTek works with major clients like Meta, Sony, and PICO, Luxshare has Apple Vision Pro assembly orders, and Pegatron has handled products for Microsoft HoloLens and Oculus, while Quanta has been involved with Microsoft Mixed Reality Headset.\nTherefore, for Foxconn and other companies aiming to enter this field, adopting more investment and collaboration strategies, or even directly acquiring key tech firms, will be the fastest way to rapidly strengthen their competitive position in the VR and AR market.\nLooking at the overall supply chain of the VR and AR virtual device industry, the efforts of assembly plants to strengthen their technical capabilities go beyond providing assembly outsourcing. To a certain extent, this is also aimed at developing the ability to offer complete product solutions, catering to a broader customer base.\nGiven that these devices prioritize image precision and real-time capture, high-end products require more components and sensors. Moreover, the non-uniform design of head-mounted devices adds complexity to the assembly of VR and AR devices.\nAdditionally, not all companies have the resources and industry competitiveness, as in the case of Meta and Sony, to independently develop head-mounted devices from scratch. For many, obtaining a more comprehensive product solution and then making adjustments is a more practical approach. This necessitates contract manufacturers\u00a0to have enhanced VR and AR technology and ODM capabilities. This way, amidst the flourishing opportunities in the virtual market, they can offer complete head-mounted device solutions.\nRead more\nRecent Posts\nRecent Comments\nArchives\nCategories\nMeta"

        "raw_content": "10 wearables (and health devices) you might have missed at CES 2024\nCES 2024 has now come to a close, and we need a well-earned rest after a week of chasing down wearables across downtown Las Vegas.\nHighlights were the Movano Evie, new Garmin Lily 2, and some promising consumer smart glasses.\nBut the halls of the Expo were full of interesting wearables, far too many to report individually.\nRead on for some of the wearables you might have missed from this year's show.\nVuzix Ultralite S\nWareable\nA follow-up to the Ultralite and new for CES 2024, the sportier-looking Ultralite S also features an incognito mode so people can\u2019t see the text or visuals through the front of the smartglasses.\nVuzix is still focused on the enterprise market, although Ultralite is an OEM product that companies could use as the basis of consumer products.\nWe got to try the Ultralite S on the show floor and had a variety of demos including turn-by-turn directions, text-to-speech, and translations.\nThe Ultralite S is seriously impressive in terms of the form factor, but still very basic in the quality of the heads-up display visuals. It\u2019s also quite hard to focus on the text, and I closed one eye to read long passages of text.\nPete Jameson, COO of Vuzix revealed to Wareable that it was working on a microLED solution that would be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for smart eyewear \u2013 which was still \u201ca year and a half\u201d away.\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nWareable\nSennheiser announced the Momentum Sport, a brand new pair of heart rate monitoring headphones, which use Polar algorithms to track your workout performance.\nThe Powered By Polar device features an optical heart rate sensor, and temperature sensor and broadcasts over Bluetooth, so it can be used by Pelotons, smartwatches and your smartphone.\nBut you can plug them into Polar Flow, and get performance analytics such as Training Load Pro, Training Benefit, and even body temperature measurements.\nStelo by Dexcom\nWareable\nWith Abbott getting into consumer CGMs with Lingo, it's no surprise that Dexcom has its product coming too. It's launched Stelo, a pared-back version of its G7 CGM, which is designed for Type 2 diabetics to understand their glucose levels. The app will track spikes and provide insights into the foods that cause high blood sugar.\nNextSense earbuds\nWareable\nThe NextSense project was born out of Google X, which certainly caught our eye \u2013 and it\u2019s led to two different products. The original project was a pair of EEG earbuds designed to offer an early warning for epileptic seizures.\nThat will be a few years away, but the same technology is being used for the NextSense sleep earbuds.\nThe same EEG tech will read your brain evaluate your sleep strategies, and enable users to work out the best way to get decent sleep. The EEG can power sleep sounds and soundscapes but also inform users about the effectiveness of treatments such as melatonin.\nIt's set to launch at the end of 2024.\nInvoxia Minitailz\nWareable\nThis pet tracker is a GPS tracker for dogs and cats \u2013 that also acts as a fitness tracker and wellness monitor. It tracks heart rate, will detect Afib, and also uses AI to warn if your pet\u2019s behaviour is changing. It can be retrofitted to your pet\u2019s existing collar.\nAmira Terra\nWareable\nThis menopause wearable will detect hot flashes from the wrist and track them within the partner app. There\u2019s also a cooling element, which uses cold water to chill a pad, which can be placed on a bed or seat to cool the body until the feeling passes and aid in better sleep.\nIdentifyHer\nIrish startup IdentityHer uses a stick-on sensor to track the symptoms of menopause. The sensor sticks to the chest, and tracks key menopausal symptoms, without the need for self-reporting.\nThe mix of sensors will track temperature, hot flashes, anxiety, and sleep. With so little research into menopause, IdentifyHer aims to help women manage their symptoms, and assess the effectiveness of treatment packages faster.\nMindLink Air\nWareable\nThese eye-tracking glasses from Canadian start-up AdHawk are designed to track the health of the brain.\nCapturing eye movements, the Mindlink Air glasses will record eye behavior and movement, blink activity, pupil dilation, gaze behavior, fixation depth, and fixation depth.\nVia the app, Mindlink will report on mental focus, and cognitive load and even assess your reading speed.\nBenzamin AI sleep controller\nBenzamin\nThis South Korean startup puts a sensor under your mattress to detect vital signs during sleep.\nThat might not sound particularly innovative, but there\u2019s more than meets the eye.\nAs well as detecting heart rate, breathing rate, and other metrics via vibrations through the mattress, it will also vibrate back, syncing to your heart rate, which it claims can boost autonomic system activity by 146% and parasympathetic nervous system activity by 116%.\nWhat does all that mean? Better sleep \u2013 but only if you live in South Korea because that's where it's launching first.\nErgoSportive smart bed\nWareable\nThis connected bed base turns your existing mattress into a smart bed and can hook up to your Garmin smartwatch. The bed base can track heart rate and respiration rate, tracking your sleep in real-time and manipulating the mattress to aid your rest. Examples could include lifting the mattress under the head if you\u2019re snoring.\nInterestingly, the bed is part of the Garmin Connectable program. That means it will populate Garmin Connect with sleep metrics if you don\u2019t want to wear your smartwatch to bed.\nHow we test\nBy James Stables\nJames is the co-founder of\u00a0Wareable, and he has been a technology journalist for 15 years.\nHe started his career at Future Publishing, James became the features editor of T3 Magazine and T3.com and was a regular contributor to TechRadar \u2013 before leaving Future Publishing to found\u00a0Wareable in 2014.\nJames has been at the helm of Wareable since 2014 and has become one of the leading experts in wearable technologies globally. He has reviewed, tested, and covered pretty much every wearable on the market, and is passionate about the evolving industry, and wearables helping people achieve healthier and happier lives."

The new Vuzix Z100 smart glasses are on display at CES 2024 and connect workers to AI.\nVuzix Z100\nBehind the sleek and modern work glasses from Vuzix is software connecting a worker to artificial intelligence. They are safety glasses certified and made to be worn all day. Right now, the glasses are only offered as a developers\u2019 edition but they represent a new look for safety glasses. The work glasses seamlessly connect the user to AI optimization tools.\nWhat they do\nThe smart glasses connect industry workers with AI tools to help in the workforce. While wearing the glasses, workers can get real-time updates and notifications. With AI, the glasses give work process applications, workflow, and task confirmations. Vuzix Z100 glasses increase the data feed from finger scanners, sensors, controllers, and other equipment. With smart glasses, workers can also get language translations, and health and workout statuses.\nGlasses display the information right in front of your eyes. Vuzix uses a custom microdisplay engine combined with monocular waveguide optics. This provides a display with a crisp image that shows real-time information.\nPaul Travers is a President and Chief Executive Officer at Vuzix and says, \u201cThe Z100 takes enterprise use of AR smart glasses to the next level, providing workers with a hands-free wearable that is indistinguishable from a pair of standard glasses.\u201d\nBeyond Work\nVuzix is going beyond the workforce at CES 2024. Smart glasses meant for sport and fitness are being showcased at CES after receiving an innovation award. The Vuzix Ultralite S AR smart glasses use the same technology as the Z100 but are for people who are into sports and fitness. Because of the technology used in the glasses, they connect with a user\u2019s smartphone or smartwatch. Messages, health, and fitness updates appear right before a user\u2019s eyes.\nThanks to Vuzix Incognito technology, the glasses virtually eliminate the eye-glow or forward light.

This represents the Company's twentieth consecutive year taking an award at CES, a significant milestone which speaks to Vuzix' track record of innovation and longevity in the AR industry. The announcement was made ahead of CES 2024, the world's most influential technology event, happening January 9-12 in Las Vegas, NV.\nVuzix' Ultralite S AR smart glasses deliver the most fashionable and lightweight pair of AR smart glasses ever assembled. Aimed in part at sports and fitness users, but boasting a sleek design that will appeal to a broad range of customers, Vuzix Ultralite S delivers hands-free, wireless connectivity to the information from the wearer's smartphone or smartwatch, in their wearer's line of sight when requested. Advanced waveguide optics and micro-LED displays create a crisp, see-through image of\u00a0 directions, messaging, health and fitness information, and even workplace data. Vuzix Ultralite S also employs Vuzix Incognito technology, virtually eliminating the eyeglow or forward light found with other waveguide-based solutions. Users will stay hands-free and connected to the information needed while on the go, see visual responses from their AI bot inquiries, but still remain aware of their surroundings thanks to the heads-up display. The Vuzix Ultralite OEM Platform can be customized for different styles, colors, and technology configurations to give consumers the look and feel for their individual lifestyles.\n\"The Ultralite S is but one example of the attractive and functional configurations possible with our Ultralite OEM Platform,\" said Paul Travers, President and Chief Executive Officer at Vuzix. \"We will continue to expand the design and performance of smart glasses products based on this platform as we continue to work with potential end customers on a white label basis.\"\nLearn more about Vuzix Ultralite\u2122 OEM solutions and contact our OEM team.\u00a0To experience use case based demos of our products, visit us at Booth #16991 this January at CES.\nThe CES Innovation Awards program, owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)\u00ae, is an annual competition honoring outstanding design and engineering in 27 consumer technology product categories.

As a result, we've identified opportunities to reduce or discontinue investments in certain areas while maintaining our investment and focus on initiatives that should deliver the most impact long-term. These organizational changes will include reductions of our global staff across all major areas of our business, including Sales and Marketing; General and Administrative; Research and Development; and Manufacturing Overhead,\" Mr. Travers continued.\n\"We anticipate that these proactive actions will result in a reduction of our cash annual operating expenses of approximately $8 million or 25%, once fully implemented. Looking forward, these collective actions should help us to improve our operating margins and significantly reduce cash losses, even during challenging demand environments while certain markets continue their slow but consistent evolutions,\" Mr. Travers concluded.\nThese broad-based cash cost reduction measures are expected to result in a material operating result contribution in 2024.\nPreliminary Fourth Quarter 2023 Revenue\nVuzix today also announces its preliminary revenues for the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2023. Fourth quarter revenue is expected to be approximately $2,100,000. Total product sales for Q4-2023 rose by 36% over Q3-2023, reflecting continuing commercial demand for Vuzix' AR smart glasses. Offsetting this improvement was a 72% sequential decline in realized engineering services.\nMr. Travers further commented, \"We have long discussed the lumpiness of smart glasses orders and engineering services. We are very optimistic about Vuzix' long-term prospects, including our increasing focus on our core technology for OEM and white label programs.\u00a0 The Company currently has the largest OEM engineering services and related products order book in its history and realizing the revenue from it is related to timing on deliveries and hitting certain milestones.\u00a0The changes announced today are in line with our goal to deliver shareholder value as the AR smart glasses industry grows and we continue to execute on our focused strategy.\"\nVuzix' fourth quarter revenue results are preliminary and unaudited and subject to change in connection with the completion of Vuzix' quarterly and year-end closing process and review procedures. As a result, these preliminary results may differ from the actual results that will be reflected in Vuzix' consolidated financial statements for the quarter ended December 31, 2023, which are expected to be released when the Company files its Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC within the next 60 days.\nAbout Vuzix Corporation\nVuzix is a leading designer, manufacturer and marketer of Smart Glasses and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies and products for the enterprise, medical, defense and consumer markets.

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nCES 2024: The Best in Travel Tech, From Personal Planes and a will.i.am.-Designed Mercedes-Benz Sound System to an AI-Enabled E-Bike\nApple Vision Pro Is Available for Pre-Order: Here's When You Can Get the New VR Headset Online\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office. It\u2019s expected to launch on Amazon this year.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nKendra Wilkinson Reflects on Her Time as Playmate After Depression Diagnosis: \u201cPlayboy Really Messed Up My Whole Life\u201d\nLana Del Rey Channels Old Hollywood Screen Sirens in Skims\u2019 New Valentine\u2019s Day Campaign\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Is Available for Pre-Order: Here\u2019s When the New Smartphone Starts Shipping\nSee the Cover of the Next \u2018Percy Jackson\u2019 Novel\n(Exclusive)\nGreen Carpet Fashion Awards Set L.A.
