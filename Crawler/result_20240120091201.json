Here\u2019s how it works.\nSennheiser and Shokz crank up the volume with our 3 favorite headphones of CES 2024\nThese are the top headphones of CES 2024 \u2014 but they won't come cheap\nLooking for a new pair of headphones? Take a look at a few of the top headphones and earbuds announced at CES 2024. Sennheiser and Shokz led the pack with new over-ear headphones, a pair of premium wireless earbuds, and a refresh of Shokz\u2019s OpenSwim bone conduction headphones.\nHere\u2019s what we know so far.\n1. Sennheiser ACCENTUM Plus\nFirst up is Sennheiser\u2019s ACCENTUM Plus over-ear headphones. These are a new addition to Sennheiser\u2019s mid-range line-up, bringing in some favorite features from their flagship MOMENTUM range, but at a slightly more affordable price.\nLaunching on February 20th at $229.95, the ACCENTUM Plus features Sennheiser\u2019s Adaptive ANC noise canceling, 50 hours of battery life per charge, Bluetooth 5.2 connectivity and touch controls built into the earcup.\nThe touch-enabled earcup is one of the features Sennheiser brought over from its MOMENTUM headphones, and I\u2019m excited to see it added to the ACCENTUM Plus. Instead of poking around on your headphones for specific buttons, you just use tap gestures on the touch-sensitive earcup for controls like volume and song skipping.\n2. \u00a0Sennheiser MOMENTUM True Wireless 4\nSennheiser also announced a refresh of their flagship in-ear headphones, the MOMENTUM True Wireless 4. The True Wireless 3 was one of our Editor's Choice picks in 2022, so we have high expectations for the next generation in this line. The True Wireless 4 earbuds feature a slew of premium upgrades for both connectivity and sound quality, including Bluetooth 5.4, Auracast support, Adaptive ANC and more.\nThe MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 has Snapdragon Sound Technology\u2019s aptX, which brings several quality and latency improvements. It helps cut out background noise and emphasize your voice on calls, optimizes music streaming quality, and minimizes lag.\nThe MOMENTUM True Wireless 4 gets about 7.5 hours of listening time, which isn\u2019t much compared to on-ear or over-ear headphones, but the charging case helps make up for that. There are three metallic color options available including silver, graphite and copper (my personal favorite). They\u2019ll all be available starting on February 15th for $299.95.\n3. Shokz OpenSwim Pro\nEver wanted to listen to your favorite playlist or podcast during a morning swim? Shokz is making that a lot easier with a much-needed update to their OpenSwim bone conduction headphones.\nThe new OpenSwim Pro is IP68 waterproof and includes 32GB of onboard storage, 8 times as much as the original model had. Plus, the Pro edition has Bluetooth 5.3, a major upgrade considering the original OpenSwim didn\u2019t have Bluetooth at all. You also get about nine hours of battery per charge and a built-in microphone.\nFor those who aren\u2019t familiar with bone conduction headphones, they sit next to your ears and emit sound through vibrations the bones in your skull pick up. This means you can listen to audio content without covering your ears, which is great for swimming, running or anytime you want to be able to hear your surroundings.\nThe OpenSwim Pro is expected to launch sometime in 2024, although Shokz hasn\u2019t announced a specific price or date yet.\nStay in the know with Laptop Mag\nGet our in-depth reviews, helpful tips, great deals, and the biggest news stories delivered to your inbox.\nBest headphone deals in January 2024\nShokz OpenMove sport headphones hit lowest price yet in Amazon Winter Sale\nBest gaming laptop deals in January 2024\nBy Laptop Mag StaffJanuary 17, 2024\nBy Mark Anthony RamirezJanuary 17, 2024\nBy Momo TabariJanuary 17, 2024\nBy Sarah ChaneyJanuary 17, 2024\nBy Stevie BonifieldJanuary 17, 2024\nBy Madeline RicchiutoJanuary 16, 2024\nBy Hilda ScottJanuary 16, 2024\nBy Madeline RicchiutoJanuary 16, 2024\nBy Hilda ScottJanuary 16, 2024\nBy Rael HornbyJanuary 16, 2024\nBy Sarah ChaneyJanuary 16, 2024\nLaptop Mag is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

        "raw_content": "Archives\nCategories\nMeta\n\ufffcCES 2024: Shokz OpenSwim Pro Combines the Best of The Line\nShokz makes a variety of earbuds for sports enthusiasts, including both its OpenSwim and OpenRun models for swimmers and runners, respectively, as well as the OpenFit pair I recently reviewed that\u2019s ideal for those who work out in a gym, run, or do other activities. At CES 2024, the company launched the OpenSwim Pro that, while most appealing to swimmers, is the model in the line that combines the best of features from the full line-up.\nShokz earbuds stand out thanks to the use of bone conduction technology. Rather than plug into your ears, they sit on your ears, some even around your neck, for a more comfortable fit. The OpenSwim Pro Bluetooth sports headphones also employ bone conduction technology with an ultra-lightweight frame and open-ear design.\nThey have a flexible nickel-titanium alloy frame with a soft silicone material and biofit design that Shokz says affords a secure fit, even with a swimming cap and goggles. But they aren\u2019t just for swimming: you can wear them while running, cycling, working out in front of the TV or at the gym, or even for phone calls while working from home or at the office. Press a single button in the Shokz app to switch between Bluetooth streaming and MP3 listening modes. With the latter, you can load playlists into the 32GB storage space, which is enough to hold about 8,000 songs.\nThe OpenSwim Pros were devised based on the feedback from swimmers. They say they love the OpenSwim buds but have expressed a desire to be able to use Bluetooth outside of the water as well.\nThese earbuds are designed with Shokz\u2019s PremiumPitch 2.0+ to produce clear sound, powerful volume, and rich bass, says the company. There are three EQ modes: swimming mode, vocal booster mode, and standard mode. When using them for phone calls, you can leverage the two mics and noise and echo cancellation.\nOpenSwim Pro has an IP68 rating so they can be worn for up to two hours submerged in two metres of water. Expect up to nine hours of battery life and a quick charge feature. Transition seamlessly between products thanks to multipoint pairing and Bluetooth v5.3 for a quick and stable connection.\nOpenSwim Pro will be available later this year. Have a look at them in our video from CES 2024.\nFOLLOW SOCIALS\nYou Might Also Enjoy\nTargus CitySmart EVA Pro Backpack Review\nI took the Targus CitySmart EVA Pro with me to ...\nMasterbuilt and Kamado Joe Reveal New Smokers, Connected Grills at CES 2024\nMasterbuilt and Kamado Joe were two of many brands showing ...\nBest Buy Canada & Bell Rebrand The Source Into Best Buy Express\nBest Buy Canada has teamed up with Bell Canada to ...\ncontact us\nJohn Thomson\n[email\u00a0protected]\nmobile: 416-726-3667\nChristine Persaud\n[email\u00a0protected]\nOur website uses cookies to improve your experience.

The five-day monster Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas allows tech industry visitors to gaze into future development plans from all kinds of tech companies ahead of the official product releases.\nSo far this year we've seen some remarkable tech developments. From massive strides in the world of display technology to artificial intelligence and the robotic invasion that's expected to take over our homes, gardens and workspaces over the next 12 months. More excitingly for me as audio editor though, is the riot of new audio products on the horizon, from the mind-blowing $750,000 (no, that's not a typo) Sonus faber Suprema speaker system, to the latest products helping to streamline our audio setups and deliver the highest quality listening experiences.\nHere's a rundown of my favorite audio picks announced at CES 2024 set to energize our ears with great sound in the year ahead.\nLuxury speaker system\nSonus faber Suprema\nPriced at\u00a0$750,000 / \u00a3695,000 / AU$1,119,980 for the full loudspeaker system, these are without exception the most expensive speaker system I've ever seen. Announced by luxury Italian loudspeaker specialist Sonus faber at CES 2024, they're easily one of the most expensive products at the Las Vegas event, and the new Suprema embodies the height of luxury and the ultimate experience for audio and design enthusiasts.\nTom's Guide readers will already know of the sumptuous $1,999 Omnia wireless speaker system, one of the best one-box music systems available. But by some margin, this is the high-end speaker company's most ambitious project ever.\nBuilt to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, the Suprema demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship.\nThe lavish Suprema speaker system is built to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, and demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship using luxurious materials including carbon fiber,\u00a0wood,\u00a0solid aluminum, and genuine Italian leather.\nThe Suprema system features 2 main lute-shaped columns weighing in at 242.5 pounds each (around 110kg) configured as a 4/5-way system\u00a0with\u00a08 front-firing speakers plus 2 back-firing drivers. The full Suprema system's matching elliptical subwoofers weigh 227 pounds (around 103kg) each. They are fitted with 2 powerful 15-inch (38cm) transducers\u00a0featuring forged carbon fiber membranes and\u00a0a neodymium magnet motor system\u00a0to ensure it delivers powerful bass notes down to 16Hz.\nLastly, the dual mono and fully balanced electronic crossover manages the integration between the Suprema main columns and subwoofers and offers\u00a0versatility while maintaining the maximum integrity of the audio signal.\nIf you have pockets (or a bank vault) deep enough, the remarkable Suprema speaker system is produced on request and available to order from the Sonus faber website.\nBest desktop audio solution\nFiiO R9\nAlthough FiiO launched several new products at CES 2024, the most eye-catching is the flagship R9 desktop streamer and headphone amp/DAC. Aimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices, including wired and wireless headphones, active speakers, smartphones and PCs.\nIt supports 6.35mm and balanced 4.4mm wired headphones connections and there's a balanced 4-pin XLR output. With a power output of up to 7300mW, FiiO says that the R9 is capable of driving both low-and high-impedance headphones.\nAround the back, there's an HDMI ARC port, SD and USB ports, plus optical, coaxial, and ethernet inputs, with the FiiO R9 also supports 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and has Bluetooth 5.0 on board with support for high-quality codec including aptX HD and LDAC.\nAimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices.\nWith 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DACs, the FiiO R9 is equipped to handle full hi-res PCM audio files up to 32-bit/768kHz, native DSD512, and features MQA decoding. The 64GB of onboard storage is expandable to 2TB via SD card, meaning your personal collection of audio files can be played back using the FiiO Music app. Streaming applications for all the best music streaming services (and more) can be downloaded and installed via either the Google Play Store or FiiO Store apps to deliver audio in its native quality.\nThe Full-HD 6-inch color touchscreen display on front is designed to provide easy system navigation, and the R9 comes supplied with a Bluetooth remote control too.\nThe FiiO R9 will be available from mid-January, priced at $1,499 / \u00a31,399 (around AU$2,239). For more information head to the FiiO website.\nBest soundbar audio partnership\nKlipsch Flexus series\nSpeaker specialist Klipsch and AV amp maker Onkyo unveiled a surprising partnership at CES 2024 with Klipsch's new Flexus series of soundbars, subwoofers and satellite speakers. The new lineup includes the Flexus Core 100 ($299) and 200 ($499) soundbars as well as the Sub 100 subwoofer and Surr 100 surrounds.\nOnkyo is probably most frequently associated with some of the best AV receivers that use power amplifiers and surround-sound decoders, both of which are crucial for soundbars.\u00a0According to a Klipsch representative, \"all of the non-passive components\" \u2014 amp included \u2014 are made by Onkyo, which bodes well for integrated speakers systems and quality control thanks to the company's technical know-how.\nThe Flexus series of products are due out by April with further innovations to the lineup coming sometime in the future. Read the full Klipsch Flexus story on their debut at\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0and what we made of the new series during a private listening demo.\nBest home cinema speaker series\nFocal Aria Evo X series\nPriced a little less lofty than Sonus faber's made-to-order Suprema loudspeaker system (top), French audio specialist, Focal, unveiled new iterations of its Aria series speakers earlier this week at CES 2024. They're still high-end though compared to majority of the best Bluetooth speakers we cover at Tom's Guide, and the updated series builds on the original Aria 900 passive loudspeaker series launched in 2013.\nThe new Focal Aria Evo X collection consists of five speakers designed for both music and home cinema, making them ideal options for the best AV receivers, although there's no mention of Dolby Atmos height speakers. The new series of speaker models includes the Aria Evo X N\u00b01 ($2,398 / \u00a31,299) compact bookshelf speaker, Aria Evo X N\u00b02 ($4,798 / \u00a32,999), N\u00b03 ($5,198 / \u00a33,499 ), N\u00b04 ($5,998 / \u00a33,999) floorstanding speakers, and Aria Evo X ($999\u00a0/ \u00a3699) center speaker.\nAs you'd expect from any new loudspeaker series, the next-gen Evo X incorporates sonic improvements said to upgrade performance including a woofer redesign for more powerful lows. The new line\u2019s midrange and bass speaker drivers are all made from Focal\u2019s iconic flax cone said to achieve a natural sound and a rich, immersive listening experience, and includes that \u2018M\u2019-shaped inverted dome tweeter for extended high frequency performance.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X speaker range is available already in black high gloss, walnut and moss green high gloss finishes. More information can be found at the Focal website and via specialist dealers.\nBest wireless streaming turntable\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe new Victrola Stream Sapphire record player comes with a modern day tech twist that offers better-than-Bluetooth wireless integration with high-quality vinyl playback to wirelessly connected speakers and devices over Wi-Fi. It looks like an ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience, as well as possibly enticing a few vinyl fans to return to the format, too.\nBuilding on the DNA of its flagship\u00a0Stream Carbon\u00a0turntable, the Victrola Stream Sapphire includes multiple wireless connectivity options (as well as wired Ethernet connectivity) \u2014 all controlled via the Victrola app. There's the ability to stream vinyl to a Sonos speaker or multiple Sonos speakers simultaneously around the home. You can also opt to stream to UPnP networked devices such as\u00a0KEF's LSX II Wireless\u00a0Hi-Fi speakers (pictured) and Roon systems (a music management solution that integrates networked storage devices and music streaming service to connect via AirPlay, Chromecast, and Roon Ready connectivity) with support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nAn ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience.\nDespite offering comprehensive wireless connectivity, there are also RCA outputs at the back that allow you to connect the Victrola to wired systems or powered speakers. The Stream Sapphire turntable has a traditional MDF plinth with walnut veneer and is fitted with adjustable-height aluminum feet with vibration isolation. There's an upgraded motor design, too, that powers the belt-driven record platter. A carbon-fiber tonearm with removable head shell and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge (worth $240) complete this turntable's audiophile credentials.\nVictrola says that the Stream Sapphire is for the vinyl lover seeking more options for high-quality wireless audio fused with beautiful design and premium components. It's expected to sell for $1,499 (around \u00a31,180 / AU$2,800) when it goes on sale in spring 2024 at\u00a0Victrola.com.\nBest wireless earbuds with audiophile sound\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nSennheiser unveiled three new products at CES 2024, but the most interesting to audiophiles like myself is the Momentum True Wireless 4. The new premium earbuds will bring the popular series bang up to date for 2024 with stacks of new features and audio enhancements incorporated into a slightly smaller design. Sennheiser bills the new version as its most capable earbuds yet, and from what I've seen, they could easily be set to rank among our\u00a0best audiophile headphones\u00a0of 2024.\nWith improved connectivity that's built on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology with aptX lossless sound quality and ultra-low latency, the new flagship will be able to stream music at higher quality via compatible devices, beating the AirPods Pro 2 in the race to lossless audio. There's Auracast support too, along with improved Adaptive ANC, evolved signature sound tuning, and an upgraded battery system. Plus, there's a Qi charging case and quick charging over USB-C.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds are expected to be available to pre-order from the\u00a0Sennheiser website\u00a0from next month, and will cost $299 / \u00a3259 (approx. AU$499).\nBest bone-conduction headphones\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra\nStraddling the line between audio, fitness and AI verticals, the Mojawa's HaptiFit Terra is an integrated smart sports device that combines haptic technology, bone conduction audio and AI Sports Trainer. As someone who's always listening to a motivational playlist when training at the gym, this Mojawa could help fitness fans to the next level.\nAlthough I haven't managed to try them out just yet, I am intrigued by Mojawa\u2019s claims that the HaptiFit Terra delivers a first-of-its-kind integrated smart sport experience for athletes to up their game, shifting fitness tracking from post-workout to real-time. The over-ear design is said to be lightweight and comfortable, providing dynamic sound and sports tracking. Mojawa says: \"The audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals with insights such as heart rate, pace, step count, calories, swimming lap and distance, and more for users to adjust their speed, set new personal records, and achieve more.\"\nThe audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals.\nLike the new Shokz OpenSwim Pro that I mentioned in my best headphones and earbuds at CES 2024, the Mojawa connects via Bluetooth and has 32GB of storage so users can train without their phone, and it's protected to IP68 making it a useful all-in-one option for swimmers. Battery life runs to 8 hours and recharges are said to complete in just one hour.\nThe Mojawa HaptiFit Terra will be available in March for $299 and is available for pre-order now via the Mojawa website with $100 off.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Although it's only Day 1 and the event is only just getting going, from what we've seen so far, 2024 looks like a big year for headphones. Especially those fitted with the latest tech developments to enhance the user experience in ways we never imagined.\nThere have been plenty of tech news stories filtering through from big and small audio brands attending the world's largest consumer electronics show, unveiling intriguing new developments for the year ahead.\nFrom Wi-Fi headphones and wireless earbuds that are capable of achieving the best-ever audio quality over Bluetooth, to headphones that help you work more productively and smart accessories that change the way we interact with our wireless earbuds. CES 2024 really does have something for every kind of headphones listener.\nHere's my pick of the 5 best headphones and wireless earbuds at CES 2024 so far.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\n1. Unity headphones\nAlthough officially unveiled in April 2023, Unity's headphones have been causing a stir among the high-end audio fraternity for their full lossless audio support up to 24-bit/96kHz from networked devices and streaming services over Wi-Fi. They're also equipped with storage for a small hi-res music library, Bluetooth connectivity, and come bundled with an adapter for wired listening, meaning you're covered for those times when Wi-Fi connectivity isn't available.\nFitted with dual-core processor, memory, storage, and a 9-axis IMU for accurate head-tracking motion detection for codec agnostic decoding of spatial and immersive audio in real-time, they are one of the most high-end audio developments we've seen in the wireless headphones market in recent years.\nUnlike most of the models being shown at CES 2024, the Unity headphones are already on sale. You'll need deep pockets though as they cost $2,199 / \u00a31,765 / AU$3,265 via the getunity.com website. Look out for our full review coming soon.\n2. Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro\nKicking off CES 2024 by winning a CES Innovation Award, the Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro headphones have already made a significant impact at the Las Vegas show as one of the first electroencephalogram (EEG)-enabled wearables intended for the consumer market.\nMade in partnership with the Neurable AI platform announced in December, they integrate neurotechnology into a new version of Master & Dynamic's popular MW75 noise-canceling headphones with sensors integrated into the fabric parts of the frame. The sensors are designed to track the wearer's brainwaves to help them identify focus periods, recognize signs of stress, and discover optimal mental well-being conditions analyzed via a Neurable AI app for iOS or Android. Neurable says that the data is stored in secured locations in an encrypted and de-identified form.\nThe Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro headphones are available to pre-order now via the\u00a0neurable website costing $649 (around \u00a3510 / AU$669).\n3. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nOne of the key features grabbing my attention from Sennheiser's trio of new models announced at CES 2024 is the introduction of the next-gen Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds with aptX Lossless Audio and Auracast support.\nBuilt on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology, the Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity with ultra-low latency and lossless audio allows them to stream music at higher quality via compatible playback devices.\nBolstering this is Auracast, which enables wireless streaming to an unlimited number of nearby audio devices. The new premium wireless earbuds by Sennheiser are the first I've heard of to officially mention the feature since it was announced by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG)\u00a0in 2022. It's an exciting development that feels a long time coming, and could mean that wearers are able to listen in to devices in public spaces such as TVs at airports, waiting rooms, and gyms, as well as public address system announcements, bringing accessibility and assistive listening to the next level.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds are expected to be available to pre-order from the\u00a0Sennheiser website\u00a0from February 15 priced at $299 / \u00a3259 / (approx. AU$499).\n4. JBL Live TWS 3 Series\nFocussing more on the smart charging case than the audio tech inside these mid-priced wireless earbuds, the JBL's Live TWS 3 Series earbuds look to continue JBL's desire to shake up the humble charging case and change the way we interact with them.\nI confess that I didn't see the development coming. But it's one that's proving very popular, and borrows tech from the much-loved JBL Tour Pro 2 ($249) wireless earbuds that arrived this time last year. The new series comes in 3 wearing styles, including Buds, Beam and Flex solutions with the different designs built to match your requirements depending on your lifestyle.\nThe updated charging case brings JBL's 1.45-inch LED touchscreen tech to all three designs in the series, and makes the charging case the main control device. Owners will have full control of almost all features and functions without needing to access the JBL Headphones app.\nAs well as the smart charging case, the buds are said to be equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nThey will be available in four new colorways including purple, blue, silver and black. The price is expected to be $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199 when they go on sale at JBL.com from mid-June 2024. Look out for our full review nearer the time.\n5. Shokz OpenSwim Pro\nIf you like listening to music or podcasts while you're wild water swimming or pacing up and down the lanes of the indoor pool, then Shokz' OpenSwim Pro is made for you. Unlike the original Shokz OpenSwim that had only 4GB of storage and no wireless connectivity, the Pro's are Bluetooth and MP3 compatible sports bone-conduction headphones, meaning you can stream your favorite audio content both in and out of the water. They have 32GB storage capacity, which means they're capable of storing up to 8,000 tracks at MP3 quality.\nLike the original Shokz OpenSwim that rank at the top of the\u00a0best waterproof headphones for swimming, the new Pro version have an open-ear design and an ultra-lightweight frame that the company says makes them the perfect design for swimming, running or cycling, while still maintaining situational awareness.\nUse under water\nDesigned with Shokz\u2019 PremiumPitch 2.0+ technology, the headphones produce clear sound, powerful volume, and a rich bass. There are three EQ modes \u2014 a swimming mode, vocal booster mode and standard mode. They also work for phone calls and are fitted with two microphones and echo cancellation.\nThe OpenSwim Pro have an IP68 rating allowing users to use their headphones for up to\u00a0two hours submerged in two meters of water. Users can also expect up to nine hours of battery life, combined with quick charging. They're said to transition seamlessly between devices, thanks to multipoint pairing and the use of Bluetooth v5.3 providing a quick and stable connection.\nAlthough there's no exact release date available just yet for the OpenSwim Pro, Shokz says that the on-sale date and price will be confirmed in the coming weeks.

        "raw_content": "News\nFinance\nSports\nEntertainment\nLife\nShokz debuts its OpenSwim Pro waterproof bone conduction headphones at CES 2024\nThis multi-sport headset offers Bluetooth 5.3 and 32GB of onboard storage.\nShokz has making Bluetooth bone conduction headsets for years, including a personal favorite: the OpenRun Pro. However, you may have overlooked one of company's more niche variants. In 2019 the company launched a model called Xtrainerz, a bone conduction headset with an IP68 waterproof rating, 4GB of onboard storage and no Bluetooth. This was pitched as an all around training headset with a focus on swimmers. Recently it was renamed OpenSwim, but today at CES 2024 in Las Vegas the company has announced its improved successor, the OpenSwim Pro waterproof headphones.\nAs with many products being announced at CES this year, the OpenSwim Pro supports Bluetooth 5.3. The big change is that it includes Bluetooth at all, making it a more useful all-around headset and less specifically targeted to swimming or triathlon use. The OpenSwim Pro also has 32GB of onboard storage, which is a healthy bump from the previous 4GB limit.\nYou get nine hours of battery life (one extra hour from the previous gen) and we\u2019re told that it offers fast charging, although those details haven\u2019t been provided yet. If it matches up to other Shokz models, that would be 1.5 hours with just five minutes of charging, which I\u2019ve found immensely useful. If you\u2019re actively using these while swimming, you can only be submerged for two hours without tempting the limits of its IP68 waterproof rating.\nThe sound quality for this model should be similar to the OpenRun model, with 8th-gen bone conduction tech. The need for a more enclosed design means it can\u2019t quite match the slightly bassier output of the OpenRun Pro, which uses venting to enhance the low end. This model does have microphones, however, which is a new addition for the OpenSwim series. It certainly seems to be a necessary feature for a Bluetooth headset, so it\u2019s a welcome addition.\nThe Shokz OpenSwim Pro will be available later in the year, although pricing and a specific launch date have yet to be determined. Those interested in receiving updates can sign up on the Shokz website.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12. Keep up with all the latest news from the show here."
