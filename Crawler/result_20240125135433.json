        "raw_content": "TechRepublic\nAccount Information\nAccount Information\nShare with Your Friends\nCES 2024: 5 Top Business Tech Trends\nYour email has been sent\nCES 2024: 5 Top Business Tech Trends\nAlthough CES is consumer-focused, many of the tools and technologies at the large trade show in Las Vegas can help businesses. Here are our picks for the most noteworthy products and trends at CES 2024, including versatile laptops, a handheld generative AI assistant, elegant TVs and mixed reality for immersive training or meetings.\n1. Generative AI integrates with laptops and apps\nGenerative AI like ChatGPT has become the hottest thing in tech over the last year, so it\u2019s not a surprise that generative AI is present at CES in a big way.\nWindows 11 laptops from Dell and other manufacturers will have a dedicated Windows for Copilot button for Microsoft\u2019s natural language AI assistant.\nIntel, Qualcomm, AMD and NVIDIA are working on building the capacity to run generative AI directly into their hardware. NVIDIA debuted Chat with RTX, which is a demo app for personalizing a generative AI model to search through content including chats, documents and videos on a Windows RTX PC or workstation.\nGenerative AI in retail at CES 2024\nIn addition, generative AI appeared in retail applications at CES 2024, with Walmart debuting it on a \u201csocial commerce platform\u201d called Shop With Friends.\nVolkswagen puts ChatGPT in cars\nVolkswagen is putting ChatGPT into its cars, allowing a busy professional to ask the generative AI to perform tasks while on the go. It\u2019s hard to say whether these use cases will prove as or more desirable than existing voice-based (but not generative) AI assistants in the long term.\n2. Productivity gadgets emphasize speed and ease\nThe hottest gadget at CES 2024 was the Rabbit R1 (Figure A), a handheld, generative AI-based device that could not only revolutionize the way people interact with apps but possibly replace the smartphone as a person\u2019s primary screen.\nThe R1, which is currently available to pre-order for $199, runs on what Rabbit calls a Large Action Model, as opposed to a large language model. The user can speak a command (e.g., \u201cBook a flight\u201d) and the R1 will simply do it without the user needing to open an app or the device needing to connect to an app using an API.\nThe Rabbit R1 is the most dramatic instance of the major productivity trend at CES 2024 of letting generative AI be the interface between the user and their tasks, making the online services and decisions in between essentially invisible.\nSEE: While ChatGPT was integrated with other tech at CES 2024, OpenAI opened the GPT Store. (TechRepublic)\n3D and wireless monitors provide more screen options\nLenovo debuted its Lenovo ThinkVision 27 3D monitor, which lets users transform 2D images into 3D content quickly; this could be a productivity boost for creative professionals. Meanwhile, Samsung introduced a new cable-free multi-monitor setup that won CES 2024 Best of Innovation in computer peripherals and accessories.\nWi-Fi 7 is proliferating\nThe Wi-Fi Alliance is starting to roll out certifications for Wi-Fi 7, meaning more devices will be able to run Wi-Fi 7\u2019s higher data throughputs for applications like virtual reality. TP-Link, UniFi, MSI and Acer released Wi-Fi 7 routers at the show.\nMore about Innovation\n3. Multiple-in-1 laptops give professionals options\nSeveral laptops that double as tablets were highlights of CES 2024. For instance, HP\u2019s Spectre x360 2-in-1 Laptop PC and Dell\u2019s new XPS line were both shown off.\nASUS introduced the Zenbook DUO (2024) UX8406 (Figure B), which comes with two screens and a keyboard and can convert into five modes total: a laptop with keyboard, two touch screens, dual screen, desktop mode (depending on whether the screens are oriented to the keyboard horizontally or vertically) or sharing mode (using both screens to show data or presentations).\n4. Qualcomm, automakers and others promote virtual and mixed reality products\nQualcomm\u2019s Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chip is expected to appear in a Samsung virtual or mixed reality headset later this month. Qualcomm has already released a reference device that could compete with the Apple Vision Pro.\nMixed and virtual reality were elsewhere at CES, too, with BMW researching mixed reality glasses for driving.\n5. Curved and transparent TV screens catch the eye\nA transparent TV screen could be an impressive set piece for a home office, turning into an art object instead of just a black rectangle when you\u2019re not using it. The Samsung Transparent MICRO LED and the LG Signature OLED T (Figure C) are showstoppers.\nA wide variety of large, curved monitors for gaming were shown off at CES 2024. Another trend was reducing glare on TVs, such as with the glare-free coating on the Samsung S95D OLED TV.\nEditor\u2019s note: TechRepublic is covering CES 2024 remotely.\nSubscribe to the Innovation Insider Newsletter\nCatch up on the latest tech innovations that are changing the world, including IoT, 5G, the latest about phones, security, smart cities, AI, robotics, and more.

        "raw_content": "Baseus Just Rolled Out an Unprecedented Innovative GaN Power Strip\nHONG KONG, Oct. 31, 2022 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Baseus Technology Ltd., the industry-leading consumer electronics brand is here with a new GaN power strip under the series name PowerCombo.\nWhen speaking of power strips, the typical picture people all have is a flat plate with outlets, sometimes in the form of a tower, and with a couple of standard USB ports. To break that stereotype and give users a brand new experience in contrast with regular power strips, the Baseus PowerCombo Pro 40W Power Strip was designed. It's the baby of a power strip and GaN charger.\nBaseus PowerCombo 40W Hybrid GaN Power Strip\nCompared to its predecessor the PowerCombo 65W and PowerCombo 100W, in case of a power spike due to a severe storm, the digital circuit monitors then automatically cuts off the power of outlets when power surge is detected to protect all the electronic devices from getting damaged, where as most traditional power strip lakes efficiency using temperature sensor requiring the power strip to reach a specific temperature even devices are already damaged. A surge protector essential to have for places or regions with stormy weather.\nIn addition to that, the built-in smart chip uses the BDIP Baseus Digital Intelligent Power technology to monitor plugged-in devices 86400 times a day to ensure users' and devices' safety all-day-long, whilst providing overpower, overvoltage, overcurrent, undervoltage, fire-resistant, and short circuit protections. The LED halo around the power button indicates the current status according to pulsing speed. It pulses slowly when working at full load, flashes quickly when abnormality is detected, and solid blue when the power strip is turned ON.\nMoving to charging interfaces, as a power strip, it features 3 outlets where 2 are on the left and right side while 1 is on top surface allowing to plug in and power several devices at a time, for instance, a TV, soundbar, and speaker, and without having to worry about a big power adapter taking up more space than just one outlet.\nAs a GaN charger, there is 2 PD USB-C and 1 USB-A ports in addition built on the front part designed to provide 40W simultaneous charging, ideal to have on a drawer next to the couch or on nightstand to charge an iPhone and other portable devices max at 20W fast charging through each USB-C port. The best combination would be an iPhone and iPad, or an iWatch.\nAs it adopts the Gallium Nitride (GaN) material, like any GaN based product, the surge protector is compact enough not to occupy excessive space on desktop, has a better temperature control, and compact enough to carry in luggage especially on a family trip or business trip to basically charge and power portable devices like smartphone, laptop, tablet, switch, steam deck, iWatch, Bluetooth speaker, and more. The concept was to replace multiple chargers with a single one.\nThe Baseus PowerCombo 40W Power Strip is an all-in-one desktop charging solution, and it is now available on big platforms like Amazon, AliExpress, and other online shopping websites.\nGallery:\nImages of products are available here.\nAbout Baseus\nFounded in 2011, Baseus is an industry-leading consumer electronics brand integrating design, research and development, production and sales. Baseus operates and creates products highlighting \"Practicality & Aestheticism\". By 2021, Baseus garnered 96 international industrial design awards including Reddot, IF, iDEA, Golden Pin, G-Mark, and Pentawards, whilst amassing up to 1325 patents.
