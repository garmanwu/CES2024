AFWERX Challenge is a fast and efficient way to solve a mission-critical problem and create positive impacts for the Department of Defense. (U.S. Air Force photo / Matthew Clouse)\nAFWERX Challenge brings companies, academia and the government together to collaborate via workshops, crowdsource idea campaigns and showcase events to quickly find solutions. While the standard government contracting process can take multiple years, technologies vetted through the Challenge model move from selection to formal agreement in 12 weeks, on average.\n\u201cThe Challenge process includes many opportunities for industry and academia to learn about Air and Space Force needs and ask questions,\u201d said Cayley Dymond, AFWERX Challenge lead. \u201cIt is very approachable, even to folks who don\u2019t have a deep military knowledge.\u201d\nTopic areas and capability gaps are brought to AFWERX from Air Force and Space Force sponsor teams across the major commands.\n\u201cTypically, our team tackles bigger problems where the user doesn\u2019t have one specific solution or solution provider in mind,\u201d Dymond added. \u201cSo our team does the market research, finds out what is out there and helps users tap into parts of industry they may not have connections to.\u201d\nAFWERX Challenge participants brainstorm\nsolutions at Capital Factory in Austin, Texas, Aug. 22, 2023.

(U.S. Air Force photo / Jennifer Bryant)\nA Challenge Definition Workshop gathers subject matter experts from industry, academia and government to discuss and define the problem, preferred direction of outcome and potential solutions. All participants help create a Challenge statement and the evaluation criteria that will be publicized in the solicitation.\nA Crowdsourcing Open Innovation Campaign is launched to solicit solutions to the Challenge statement. Innovators from industry, academia, the government and \u00a0international allied partners can submit solutions to a panel of DOD experts. The top evaluated ideas are invited to the pitch and showcase.\nThe pitch and showcase brings together the selected solution providers and potential government customers to deliver a private pitch, followed by a Q&A session and demonstration to further evaluate solutions.\nThe AFWERX Challenge team brings together contracting officers to expedite the process for selected companies to continue development and deliver solutions.\nThe process allows for rapid deployment of these innovative solutions to the warfighter and the potential for any DOD entity, not just the initial government sponsor, to contract with the selected companies for up to a year after the date of the Challenge showcase.\n\u201cWe interacted with several stakeholders, labs and other companies that we didn\u2019t know existed and got instant feedback,\u201d said Todd Newton, vice president of business development at Jetoptera. \u201cThat feedback allows our small business to quickly make modifications to your product and provide innovative products to the warfighter faster.\u201d\nSince 2018, AFWERX has hosted 49 Challenges, received more than 7,600 solutions and awarded $78.8 million for 122 prototypes. According to Dymond, the biggest AFWERX Challenge success story to date was the Sky High Relief challenge. In 2021, 56 companies were invited to pitch a new female bladder relief solution for aircrew flying 8 to 10 hour missions strapped to an ejection seat. The Challenge was also the first to award prize money for selected solutions.\nOf those 56 companies, 10 were awarded approximately $100,000 and one company was awarded $250,000 under the authority of USC 3719. \u00a0One of the 11 companies, Airion, has a female bladder solution that will begin flight testing in December 2023.

(Courtesy graphic)\n\u201cI would definitely recommend an AFWERX fellowship to anybody who wants a challenge and likes a fast-paced working environment,\u201d said Chris Heckman, a current AFWERX fellow. \u201cYou get to learn about new technologies and accelerate them to the warfighter, which is very exciting.\u201d\nAFWERX fellowships are designed to cultivate a better understanding of current industry trends, broaden innovation perspectives and expose Airmen and Guardians to programs with a DAF- level impact. The fellowships include a professional development curriculum, allowing selectees to refine their project management capabilities and expand their skill sets.\nFellows can expect to support a range of projects, including major command outreach, accelerating and transitioning Airmen and Guardians\u2019 ideas to the field and participating in a Small Business Innovation Research/Small Business Technology Transfer contracting sprint.\nTraditional fellows will be assigned to one of AFWERX\u2019s divisions for four months. Heckman, an Air Force Life Cycle Management Center HH-60 Pave Hawk program manager with five years of acquisition experience, is assigned to AFVentures because his background and skill set aligned best with that division. Its mission is to fund emerging technologies via government and private capital to deliver Air Force and Space Force capabilities and broaden access to disruptive innovation.\nChris Heckman, left, AFWERX fellow, and his co-workers tour an air traffic control tower during the fall program management review at Eglin Air Force Base, Fla., Oct. 26, 2023. AFWERX program management reviews bring a full-time remote organization together for in-person meetings and provide employees opportunities to connect face-to-face. (Courtesy photo)\n\u201cIt was definitely a unique experience for me and was good to learn a different side of acquisitions,\u201d Heckman said. \u201cThe process in AFWERX is so much faster than what I\u2019m used to and getting technologies to the field quickly will hopefully help us gain an advantage.\u201d\nHeckman is part of the Strategic Funding Increase and Tactical Funding Increase team and is responsible for inputting contract data, creating data analysis dashboards and sending emails to contract-awarded small businesses to make sure they are meeting milestones and to offer support as needed.\nHeckman said his most memorable highlight was attending the AFWERX program management review at Eglin Air Force Base, Florida, in October and meeting his co-workers in person. The fellowship experience has been so much fun that he doesn\u2019t want it to end.\n\u201cOnce you find something that you enjoy doing, you want to keep learning more and more about it and it has kept me engaged,\u201d Heckman added.\nFellowships are open to all ranks of the Air and Space Forces, Reserve, Guard and government civilians. Both full-time and part-time fellowship positions are available, and are primarily being offered virtually, making them accessible to applicants regardless of location.\nFeatured News\nSenior Leader Priorities\nInnovation\nMAJCOM News\nQuick Links\nCareers\nConnect"

CMMC is a key component of the Department\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expansive defense industrial base (DIB) cybersecurity improvement effort aimed at simplifying and streamlining the process to help businesses improve their cybersecurity.\nThe program is designed to ensure that defense contractors and subcontractors are compliant with existing information protection requirements described in NIST SP 800-171/-172 for controlled unclassified information (CUI) and federal contract information (FCI). Additionally, as discussed in the proposed rule, CMMC requires cybersecurity assessment at only three levels, starting with basic safeguarding of FCI at CMMC Level 1.\nThe DoD estimates overall program costs will be reduced by allowing for self-assessments for Level 1 and some Level 2 assessments and minimizing cost to industry for Level 3 assessments by having Government assessors from Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity Assessment Center (DIBCAC) conduct these assessments.\nClick here to learn more: https://ow.ly/MH7750QsiZV\n.\n.\n.\n#AFWERX #DoD #Government #CMMC #cybersecurity #federal #CUI #FCI\n44,665 followers\nThe curtains have closed on an eventful CES 2024 in Las Vegas for our AFWERX team!

It looks very similar to a Shark Tank item. We do a call to the air force and we say \u201cWhat are your great ideas?\u201d And it proceeds its way up through various headquarters, and it makes its way to the Pentagon, and ultimately in February we have six finalists who stand in front of our chief of staff and secretary of the air force.\u2019\nAFWERX announced the second winner of its Spark Tank competition in February 2019. The competition, which is the culminating event of the crowdsourcing platform IdeaScale, brings forward new ideas to top military officials including bringing integrated communication to respirators and additions to airdrop mechanisms to improve their reliability.\n\u2018Another way that we have approached innovation at the base level is that we have base level innovation offices, and this is very important with regard to the effort philosophy in that we did not request that say \u201cyou ought\u201d or \u201cyou shall have an innovation office at all of your 200 bases\u201d. Instead we said \u201cwe\u2019ve got one or two here\u201d, starting in California, and they seem to like what they\u2019re doing,' Maue said.\n\u2018And so we have grown from an initial Spark cell to 44 different bases now having innovation offices, not because it was demanded of them by senior leaders, but because it\u2019s that authentic growth that we see a value adding function here, we want to adopt that practice.\u2019\nAFWERX currently has three physical innovation hubs, in Washington DC, Austin and near Las Vegas. The Vegas location is the largest of the three, although Maue said that they all \u2018bring their own unique string to the overall ecosystem\u2019.\nWith the Pentagon continuing to explore\u00a0multi-domain operations (MDOs), AFWERX is working to provide solutions to the MDO problem sets.\n\u2018In April we held a challenge workshop where we asked for, in an unclassified setting out in Las Vegas, with over 100 attendees, some from the army, some from the navy, there were a few international services there as well. And along with industry academics researchers who gave some great discussions about AI, some talking about data, some talking about the MDO problem. We worked together over the course of two days to develop this series of statements in April. These statements were then placed on the AFWERX website,' Maue explained.\n\u2018As a result of putting out that challenge, we received 317 submissions. We had a series of judges who looked at the submissions and then selected what appeared to be the top 100. They came out and had exhibitor tables in July. And from there we picked a list of the top 30 finalists that we want to see advanced. We\u2019re looking at 19 to 21 November to have deeper presentations.\u2019\nShephard also spoke to Maue about what successes AFWERX has had so far. Maue told said that \u2018typically our timeframe is we would like to see something happen in around 18 months, so we\u2019re watching some of these origin stories come to their conclusion.\u2019\nOne of the main successes to date came from the winner of the first Spark Tank: MSG Bartek Bachleda. His creation was a new platform for the boom operators of KC-135 Stratotankers, intended to dramatically reduce injuries \u2013 in particular back and neck issues.\nHis design, after small tweaks, is currently undergoing a second round of testing. Maue said that \u2018it\u2019s quite possible that by the end of the year, start of next year, these prototype platforms will be adopted within the KC-135.\u2019\nAFWERX has also been working to redesign and replace the existing fixed wing helmet used by pilots and aircrew to develop an alternative that is lightweight and comfortable, with improved noise protection and better thermal management.\nMaue said three \"very solid\" prototypes had been selected with a fourth under investigation, and were now under testing to go into the active duty.\nThe Shephard News Team\nAs part of our promise to deliver comprehensive coverage to Premium News and Defence Insight \u2026\nShare to\nSOF Week 2023: Commander, Special Operations Command - Korea interview\nUPDATED: Romania orders Polaris DAGOR special operations vehicles\nSOF Week 2023: GSOF reflects on a successful first SOF Week (video)\nSOF Week 2023:\nCACI International Inc displays EW capabilities (video)\nSOF Week 2023: Helping small companies do business with USSOCOM (video)\nUPDATED: Romania orders Polaris DAGOR special operations vehicles\nSOF Week 2023: USSOCOM to consolidate Program Executive Offices into single entity\nSOF Week 2023: Commander, Special Operations Command - Korea interview\nYou may also like\nBayraktar TB3 makes international debut at UMEX\nNorthrop and Mitsubishi partner to enhance Japan\u2019s air and missile defence network\nTaiwan to widen seven air force runways\nSky high diplomacy: Saudi Arabia's fighter jet puzzle entangles Eurofighter, Rafale and global alliances\nMore from Five Eyes Connectivity Special Report\nPodcast: Five Eyes Connectivity - Canada\nIn this episode of the Five Eyes Connectivity podcast, we look at the unique situation faced by Canada and how its military is responding to a rapidly changing world.\nPodcast: Five Eyes Connectivity - Australia and New Zealand\nIn this episode of the Five Eyes Connectivity podcast, we hear how two of the smaller militaries in the Five Eyes alliance \u2013 Australia and New Zealand \u2013 are responding to a rapidly-changing world.\nPodcast: Five Eyes Connectivity - The United Kingdom\nIn this episode of the Five Eyes Connectivity podcast, we hear how a rapidly shifting threat environment is driving a transformation of British military capabilities.\nPodcast: Five Eyes Connectivity - The United States\nIn this episode of the Five Eyes Connectivity podcast, we dive into the connectivity issues facing the US military and its further development of the Multi-Domain Operations concept.\nAustralian CHORUS is on song\nThe Australian Department of Defence announced on 11 May that it is exploring ways to integrate laser-based optical and RF communication technologies onto a single \u2026\nTactical data link provider expects major new order this month\nLooking to the future of the Multifunctional Informational Distribution System Joint Tactical Radio System (MIDS JTRS), BAE Systems expects an imminent new production contract and \u2026\nConnect with us on socials\nNews\nShephard\nTerms and Conditions|Privacy Policy|\u00a9 2024 Shephard Press Limited (The), All rights reserved.\nSite by\nOr login\nStay up to date with our Newsletter"
