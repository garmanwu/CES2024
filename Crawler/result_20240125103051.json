NTT has acquired property from Lerner Enterprises in Gainesville, Va. where it plans to develop 2 million square feet of data center space, supporting 336 megawatts (MWs) of capacity.\nThe 103-acre campus will provide room for long-term growth for NTT and its customers in Northern Virginia, where the company already operates a major campus in \u201cData Center Alley\u201d in Ashburn, the primary cloud hub in Loudoun County.\nNTT says the Gainesville project will become its single largest campus, with plans for four two-story data center buildings, with the first scheduled to come online in the second quarter of 2024.\u00a0 The design will also offer \u201cdedicated self-contained areas for large-footprint deployments\u201d to support hyperscale clients.\n\u201cThe development of a new data center campus in Virginia is testament to our huge growth and momentum across North America\u201d said Doug Adams, President and CEO at NTT Global Data Centers Americas. \u201cThis strategic purchase of land is just one of the many steps we\u2019re taking to accelerate our data center footprint across the country.\u201d\nNTT Global Data Centers Americas is in the midst of a major expansion, with construction projects underway across the U.S. to add more capacity.

As a result, the demand for data centers to support this shift has never been higher. As one of the largest data center providers in the world, NTT is well placed to support this reliance, and we\u2019re focused on supporting our customers as their needs continue to change,\u201d\nData Center Developers Look Beyond Ashburn\nNorthern Virginia has become the global capital for cloud computing, and is home to hundreds of data centers. That includes many hyperscale facilities operated by Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, as well as data center developers who support their growth.\nData center development in Prince William County has accelerated in recent years as development parcels grow scarce near the regional data center hub in Ashburn in Loudoun County. There is now a growing cloud cluster near Manassas, and land speculation from developers has boosted property values, with recent transactions valuing data center development sites at nearly $1 million an acre.\nThere is now an estimated 5.3 million square feet of data center space in Prince William County, with another 8 million to 10 million square feet in the development pipeline, according to a recent report.\nThe NTT project is part of a data center building boom in Gainesville around the intersection of Route 66 and 29 (Lee Highway). The NTT property is across the highway from Gainesville Crossing, a large campus from Corscale that will feature 2.3 million square feet of data center space and 306MW of utility power.\nBoth projects are west of the proposed Prince William Digital Gateway, which could add millions of addition square feet of data centers and has generated lively debate about the appropriate location for future development in the county.\nNTT Accelerates Global Data Center Expansion\nThe Gainesville campus is part of an ongoing global expansion for NTT, which plans to increase its data center footprint to more than 1,000 MWs in 20 countries by the end of 2022. NTT says its data centers in Prince William will be sustainable, as part of the company\u2019s commitment to achieving net-zero emissions across its data center operations by 2030.\nIn addition to its U.S. campuses, NTT Global Data Centers recently announced the opening of data centers in Madrid, Navi Mumbai in India, and its largest data center in Indonesia in Jakarta. NTT Global Data Centers also has ongoing construction that will deliver new data centers in Germany, India, and Johannesburg later this year.\nIn the U.S., each campus is designed for multiple data centers, which allows customers who want contiguous space to easily add capacity in adjacent data halls or buildings. Here\u2019s a look at the company\u2019s US footprint:\nIn 2018 NTT Global (then known as RagingWire) launched its primary campus in Data Center Alley in Ashburn, shifting to greenfield construction, customized from the ground up to support the company\u2019s vision for Internet-scale campuses.\nThe first building, VA3, is a 16 MW data center featuring a mix of vault designs from 2 megawatts to 6 megawatts of power capacity, as well as a large room for multi-tenant retail colocation. VA4 and VA5 are 32-megawatt buildings with expanded and standardized vaults, and VA6 will feature NTT\u2019s new 36-megawatt design \u2013 two floors, with three 6-megawatt data halls on each floor.\nAt least three more data center buildings are planned for the Ashburn campus, totaling 224 megawatts of capacity. The Prince William campus will be 50 percent larger, providing a next phase of growth for NTT and its clients from 2024 forward.\nHaving capacity can provide an advantage, especially as customers seek accelerated delivery timelines to meet demand for cloud services.\n\u201cOne of the things our client base has told us that they appreciate how we build ahead in our markets,\u201d said Adams in a recent conversation with DCF.\nRich Miller\nContinue Reading\nAmazon Plans Major Data Center Expansion in Virginia's Spotsylvania County\nDCF Tours: NTT Global Data Centers Americas' Dallas TX1, Garland, Texas\nSponsored Recommendations\nData-driven Asset Performance Management White Paper\nA Guide to Understanding the NFPA 70B Code Changes\nNestl\u00e9 Nescaf\u00e9 perks up power reliability with EcoStruxure\u2122 Asset Advisor\nNFPA\u00ae 70B just got overhauled\nVoices of the Industry\nJumpstarting your Data Center Decarbonization Journey\nLatest in Cloud\nThe Eight Themes That Will Shape the Data Center Industry in 2024\nScorecard: Looking Back at Data Center Frontier\u2019s 2023 Industry Predictions\nThe Top Data Center Industry Stories of 2023\nWhite Papers\nThe Data Center Edge of Tomorrow: Five Critical Ways Digital Twins and AI Will Impact the Network\nSponsored\nNestl\u00e9 Nescaf\u00e9 perks up power reliability with EcoStruxure\u2122 Asset Advisor\nIoT EcoStruxure Ensures Continued Learning at Bainbridge Island School District\nNFPA\u00ae 70B just got overhauled"
