This was\u00c2\u00a0the first time for Disheng to participate in the CES exhibition, and was also the first time to participate in an\u00c2\u00a0exhibition in the United States. Therefore, this exhibition is an important opportunity for Disheng\u00c2\u00a0to go deep into the US market.\nIn order to acquire new customers, the team members comprise of senior executives of our\u00c2\u00a0company, and are directly led by the general manager and deputy general manager. There is no doubt that they have extensive knowledge of the\u00c2\u00a0factory and products, and they are\u00c2\u00a0more convincingly introduce core competence\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0our production, product research and development which attracts visitors in many aspects. During the exhibition, our participants were able to chat smoothly with customers, and the topics continued to amuse each other, creating a natural and harmonious atmosphere. Moreover, they were\u00c2\u00a0neither humble nor overbearing. When facing customers, they took\u00c2\u00a0the initiative to ask many questions to them in order to better understand the other company and its market conditions, so as to provide customers with reasonable products and price plans.\nDongguan Disheng Technology Electronic Co., Ltd was founded in 2016 and has been specializing in all kinds of smartphone screen protectors and mobile phone accessories such as chargers and cables. At CES\u00c2\u00a02023, Disheng mainly showed our iPhone 14 series\u00c2\u00a0of tempered film and chargers with a variety of power options\u00c2\u00a0to customers. Moreover, our exhibitors even bought the exhibition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00c2\u00a0samples at a discount. The scene was once hot, and there was an endless stream of people coming and going. This not only attracts more people to pay attention to us and shortens the distance between each other, but also allows potential customers in the crowd to further understand the use of our products. In addition, this kind of activity can also reflect the interests and usage tendencies of customers, and help us better understand product market trends. The effect of this exhibition is very ideal, which is very meaningful and beneficial to us, so Disheng\u00c2\u00a0has gotten\u00c2\u00a0the same booth - No.\u00c2\u00a053771\u00c2\u00a0in 2024. We look forward to meeting new and old friends here again in January next year.\nIn a sense, what we sell is not a product but a factory. Disheng's current main business is OEM and ODM.\u00c2\u00a0In order\u00c2\u00a0to provide\u00c2\u00a0more people with OEM/ ODM service, we want to let more foreign\u00c2\u00a0partners know us. Through the exhibition,\u00c2\u00a0we hope that they can understand the strength of our factory in terms of management, products, certificates, etc. Exhibiting our flagship products in many countries and places is the most effective means under the current circumstances. We will let customers recognize Disheng's products first, and welcome them to visit our factory at any time. Through long-term communication and exchanges, we will finally achieve win-win cooperation between the two parties.\n\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0Our 2023 American CES exhibition tour of Disheng has ended, but the pace of progress has not stopped. Now, we are preparing for the upcoming Global Sources Hong Kong Consumer Electronics Show in April, and look forward to meeting you at AsiaWorld-Expo from April 18th to 21st. In addition, we also made it clear that we will participate in the German IFA exhibition in June, the Dubai GITEX exhibition in August and the Global Sources Hong Kong exhibition in October.
