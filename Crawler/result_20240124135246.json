After a strong showing of AI advancements on their lifestyle products at the show, Samsung is now ready to introduce AI into their smartphone division with the newly announced Galaxy S24 series. In fact, the tagline of the unveiling was \u201cGalaxy AI is here\u201d and boy is there a lot to unpack.\nIt\u2019s a new year and that means it is time for a refresh of products from Xiaomi\u2019s budget brand, Redmi.

Powered by a 16.9-kW\u00b7h battery, the model features a 75-kW electric motor capable of 0-60 mph in 2.8 s and a top speed of 125 mph.\nThe second new model is the Senmenti X Hyper GT, a performance touring motorcycle. With a WLTP-estimated range of at least 250 mi on a full charge, DC power outlet, adaptable riding position, and adjustable equipment, it is said to offer a combination of rideability, comfort, and \u201cluxurious performance,\u201d with a top speed of 125 mph.\nLastly, the Senmenti 11 is a sleek, futuristic concept of a high-performance motorcycle. Sharply styled with sleek panels, oversized wheels, and an aggressive stance, the concept is designed for thrill-seekers and adventurers. No detailed specifications for it were released, but Horwin says it will be capable of a 0-80% charge in under 30 min, like the other products in the Senmenti line.\n\u201cThe U.S. is obviously a critical sales market for any EV company,\u201d said Wendsor Zhou Wei, CEO and Founder of Horwin. \u201cAs vehicle manufacturers transition to an all-electric future, Horwin is already ahead of the curve, thanks to years of developing advanced 5G-enabled manufacturing processes enriched with artificial intelligence to pioneer a more sustainable future.\u201d\nAmong the Senmenti series\u2019 technology highlights is the IM (Intelligent Mobility) chassis intended to address the balance of performance, range, and weight. The chassis features a highly integrated structure that enables more battery range, reduces unnecessary wires and connection parts, and provides efficient thermal management. It is said to contribute to a longer range, higher performance, and lower power waste in operation.\nThe company\u2019s AI-powered ARAS (Advanced Rider Assistance System) is designed to increase personalization by collecting data to understand the rider, preventing accidents, and enhancing rider protection and confidence. It includes 360-degree vision, adaptive cruise control, lane detection, intelligent high-beam switching, and sentry mode.\nA sophisticated thermal management system features 3-in-1 electrical control, a modular connection, and intelligence to minimize unnecessary heat generation, support pre-heating in low temperatures, and provide insulation during stationary charging. \u201cMicropower grid\u201d charging capabilities can power a variety of electric devices, appliances, and other Senmenti motorcycles.\nThe company is also working on self-balance technology for future generations.\nAll three new Horwin models launched and unveiled at CES are now available for pre-order with a fully refundable $100 deposit via the company\u2019s website. The first 500 pre-booking customers who order a new Senmenti 0 will receive three years of free charging nationwide, lifetime OTA push upgrades, and \u201can amplification\u201d of the $100 deposit that translates to a $900 discount on the down payment.\nKevin Jost contributed to this article.\nRelated\nJoin the movement\nBecome a part of the Futurride.com community to receive updates from our team, our weekly enewsletters, and full access to our content.\nYou have successfully joined!\nShare:\nAbout The Author\nGary Mason, a Futurride contributor, is a storyteller and communications professional with more than 10 years of experience in the automotive industry.

Scheduled from January 9 to 12, 2024, CES 2024 will showcase some of the latest and greatest innovations in the tech and electronics industries, including some notable new products in the e-mobility space.\nWe\u2019ve talked about Horwin on multiple occasions in the past, as the Chinese electric mobility company has developed quite a strong presence in Europe. In the US, the company will be headquartered in California, and focus on accelerating the adoption of electric two-wheelers with the launch of premium models. For starters, the Senmenti 0, an electric scooter that was unveiled at EICMA 2023, will be the first production model on offer, and will carry an MSRP of $16,800 USD. Meanwhile, the company is also set to showcase two new concept models called the Senmenti X and Senmenti 11.\nIn terms of specs and features, Horwin says that the Senmenti 0 can be charged to 80 percent in just 30 minutes, and is compatible with most home charging stations. The powerful electric scooter has a top speed of 125 miles per hour, and offers a claimed range of up to 186 miles on a single charge. Other impressive features include intelligent vehicle networking thanks to Horwin\u2019s AI-powered Advanced Rider Assistance System (ARAS).\nHorwin wants to sweeten the deal for the first 500 pre-booking customers of the Senmenti 0 by throwing in three years of free charging, lifetime OTA updates, and a $100 USD deposit.\nApart from the Senmenti 0 electric scooter which is pretty much ready to hit the road, Horwin will also be showcasing two concept models called the Senmenti X and Senmenti 11. The Senmenti X is clearly a futuristic model that focuses on performance and long-distance capabilities. Horwin says that it has at least 250 miles of range, and even flaunts adjustable ergonomics to tailor fit the preferences of individual riders.\nMeanwhile, the Senmenti 11 is all about urban exploration, and takes the form of a futuristic evocation of our standard naked streetfighters today. Its compact design and high-power electric motor make it the ideal machine for riders looking to add a bit of thrill to their daily rides.\nIn an article by Roadracing World, Horwin founder and CEO Wendsor Zhou Wei expressed excitement towards the brand\u2019s expansion into the US market. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to introduce Horwin and tell our story to new audiences.

        "raw_content": "Horwin makes US electric motorbike debut \u2013 but at a price\nHorwin\u2019s flashy flagship electric motorbike, the SENMENTI 0 production model, has just made its US debut at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nBest classified as a maxiscooter, the SENMENTI 0 is likely to compete against other high-performance, futuristic-looking models such as the BMW CE 04 electric motorbike.\n\u201cHorwin comes to the market with a dream to disrupt, trailblazing with pioneering technologies that propel the mobility industry towards a sustainable future,\u201d explained the company.\nIt\u2019s true, Horwin has often helped embrace several new technologies and trends in the electric motorcycle industry, including being one of the first to roll out a multi-speed manual gearbox for light electric motorcycles several years ago.\nBut this time, the result is a bit pricier\u2026 to the tune of an expected US $16,800. That\u2019s how much the Horwin SENMENTI 0 is expected to retail for in the US. Order books are already open and a $100 deposit snags prospective riders three years of free charging. Details on how that perk will work are scarce, but considering the bike\u2019s built-in 30-minute DC fast charging capabilities, it could mean a free pass at certain charging networks.\nSo what does $17k get you in an electric maxiscooter? For starters, there\u2019s a massive 16.9 kWh battery. That\u2019s larger than almost every flagship electric motorcycle out there these days. In fact, the company claims that it could offer a mixed highway/city range of up to 186 miles (300 km).\nThat big battery helps dump some serious power into the drivetrain, too. The 74 kW (100 hp) electric motor is powerful enough to offer a 0-60 mph time of just 2.8 seconds. It also gets the bike up to a top speed of 125 mph (200 km/h), though most riders will be unlikely ever to find a place to take advantage of that figure.\nThe 507 lb (230 kg) SENMENTI 0 also features an Advanced Rider Assistance System (ARAS) that is \u201cdesigned to increase personalization as the system collects data to understand the rider, preventing accidents and enhancing rider protection and confidence.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not entirely clear when the bikes will be ready for deliveries, but test rides for reservation holders are expected to begin in Q3 2024.\nThe company also showed off two concept vehicles. The SENMENTI X Hyper GT is described as \u201cthe ultimate performance touring motorcycle\u201d with a WLTP-estimated range of at least 250 miles (400 km), as well as the SENMENTI 11, which is described as an even higher performance motorcycle designed \u201cfor thrill-seekers and adventurers.\u201d\nAs Horwin founder and CEO Wendsor Zhou Wei explained:\n\u201cWe\u2019re thrilled to introduce Horwin and tell our story to new audiences.

As part of this effort, they\u2019ll be showcasing a trio of electric motorcycles.\nThe first is the $16,800 Senmenti 0, which is billed as a sporty and versatile urban adventure bike. Horwin didn\u2019t go into many specifics, but the model features angular lines and distinctive lighting units.\nThe bike measures 84.4 inches (2,144 mm) long and has a seat height of 31.2 inches (792 mm).

It feeds an electric motor developing 99 hp (74 kW / 101 PS) and 659 lb-ft (894 Nm) of torque. This setup enables the bike to accelerate from 0-60 mph (0-96 km/h) in 2.8 seconds, before hitting a top speed of 125 mph (201 km/h). The company also said it can go from a 0-80% charge in as little as 30 minutes with a DC fast charger.\nThe bike is currently available for pre-order and U.S. deliveries are slated to begin in the fourth quarter of this year.\nThe model will be followed by the Senmenti X in 2025, which is being previewed by a similarly named concept. It\u2019s a \u201cHyper GT\u201d that is designed to be the \u201cultimate performance touring motorcycle.\u201d\nLooking like something from a Tron film, the concept has illuminated wheels and a futuristic fairing. The company didn\u2019t say much about the bike, but we can see X-shaped lighting units, a simulated engine, and a sizable seat.\nThe bike is equipped with a 25.9 kWh battery pack, which provides an estimated range of 250+ miles (402 km) in the WLTP cycle. The concept also sports a 99 hp (74 kW / 101 PS) motor, which enables the bike to hit 60 mph (96 km/h) in less than four seconds.\nLast but not least, the Senmenti 11 is slated to arrive in 2026.

        "raw_content": "Horwin Enters U.S. Electric Motorcycle Market with Trio of Innovations at CES 2024\nIn a strategic move to capture the American electric motorcycle market, Chinese manufacturer Horwin is gearing up to make a notable debut at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024. The company plans to unveil a trio of electric motorcycles, each designed to offer a unique blend of performance, style, and cutting-edge technology.\nLeading the charge is the Senmenti 0, a sporty and versatile urban adventure bike priced at $16,800. Horwin, while remaining tight-lipped on specific details, highlights the model's distinctive angular lines and unique lighting units. Measuring 84.4 inches in length with a seat height of 31.2 inches, the Senmenti 0 promises a dynamic riding experience.\nSee also: Horwin Unveils \u201cProject Horizon\u201d Electric Scooter: Promises 300 KM Range Starting at $15,957\nOne of the standout features of the Senmenti 0 is its AI-powered advanced riding assistance system. This system, according to Horwin, aims to enhance personalization by collecting rider data to prevent accidents and boost rider protection and confidence. Safety is further emphasized with adaptive cruise control, blind spot detection, and front/rear collision warning systems. The bike also boasts automatic high beams, a 360-degree vision system, hill descent control, lane detection technology, uphill assistance, and a Sentry mode.\nSee also: Horwin SK3 Electric Scooter : Specifications, Range, and Price\nWeighing in at 507 lbs, the Senmenti 0 is equipped with a formidable 16.9 kWh battery, offering an impressive range of 186 miles. The electric motor churns out 99 hp and a robust 659 lb-ft of torque, propelling the bike from 0-60 mph in just 2.8 seconds, with a top speed reaching 125 mph. Charging convenience is addressed with the capability to go from 0-80% charge in as little as 30 minutes using a DC fast charger. Pre-orders for the Senmenti 0 are already open, and U.S. deliveries are scheduled to commence in the fourth quarter of this year.\nFollowing the Senmenti 0, Horwin has its sights set on the Senmenti X, expected to hit the market in 2025. Described as a \u201cHyper GT\u201d performance touring motorcycle, the concept version offers a glimpse of a futuristic ride with illuminated wheels, a sleek fairing, and a 25.9 kWh battery pack. Horwin estimates an impressive range of 250+ miles on the WLTP cycle, powered by a 99 hp electric motor capable of accelerating the bike to 60 mph in less than four seconds.\nSee also: Land Moto Announces Second Production Run of District Electric Motorcycle with Lowered Prices\nThe ambitious lineup extends to the Senmenti 11, slated for a 2026 release. A minimalist concept previewing this model showcases vertical lighting units and split rear wheels, with the intriguing addition of \u201cvariable body covers in different styles,\u201d suggesting customizable aesthetics.\nHorwin's CEO, Wendsor Zhou Wei, expressed enthusiasm about introducing the brand to new audiences in the U.S., recognizing the pivotal role the market plays for any electric vehicle company. He looks forward to showcasing the advantages of riding an electric motorcycle to a diverse range of riders.\nU.S. Excludes Electric Vehicles with Chinese Batteries from Tax Credits, Impact on Korean Battery Industry Uncertain\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "Motorcycles of CES 2024: AI-driven tech steals the spotlight\nEvery January, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) attracts tech giants, automakers, electronics brands, and startups to Las Vegas. With more than 40 categories represented, this year's event showcased all corners of technology, from Hyundai\u2019s electric air taxi to voice-controlled bidets.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) stood center stage this year, with Volkswagen announcing a ChatGPT-supported digital assistant and Samsung unveiling an AI-driven robot. Electric motorcycle manufacturers were no exception, and innovations revealed by two brands \u2014 Verge and Horwin \u2014 stole much of the spotlight.\nVerge TS Ultra and Starmatter software\nVerge introduced the TS Ultra model at CES 2023. According to the Finland-based company, its flagship electric produces 201 horsepower, generates 885 foot-pounds of torque, and reaches a top speed of 124 mph. The Ultra\u2019s 20.2 kWh battery reportedly nets 233 miles (on a single charge) and charges from zero to 80% in just 25 minutes. If those claims sound optimistic, they\u2019re only matched by Verge\u2019s Starmatter software.\nAt CES 2024, Verge debuted an updated TS Ultra, monitored by its Starmatter intelligence platform. Utilizing six cameras (three rear-facing and three front-facing) and radar units fore and aft, the Starmatter Vision system expands the rider's \u201cspatial awareness\u201d with a \u201c360-degree view\u201d of the motorcycle's surroundings. The system then relays potential hazard alerts to the user via the new Starmatter TFT display.\nThe safety-oriented sensors aren\u2019t the only hardware keeping tabs on the TS Ultra\u2019s every move. A GPS module and an accelerometer also record vehicle data, while cellular, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth compatibility keep the model connected. By processing and analyzing the collected data, Verge\u2019s AI can \u201cbuild powerful machine learning models\u201d that adapt the TS to the user\u2019s riding habits.\nVerge already equips the range-topping model with safety aids like traction control and ABS along with comfort features such as cruise control. The firm plans to periodically refine those systems and the Starmatter algorithms by distributing \u201cdeep core updates\u201d via over-the-air (OTA) technology.\nThe first Starmatter-equipped Ultras are slated to start shipping in Q4 2024 and Verge \u201cupgraded\u201d all existing reservation holders to the tech-laden trim. Fortunately, the TS Ultra\u2019s price tag remains $44,900 in the United States. Verge isn\u2019t the only electric mobility brand extolling the benefits of artificial intelligence, though.\nHorwin Senmenti series\nNot to be outdone, the Horwin Senmenti 0's spec sheet also skews toward the sensational. From its 659 foot-pounds of torque and 99 horsepower to its 125-mph top speed, the model\u2019s claimed capabilities appear excessive for an urban electric scooter. DC fast charging supposedly recharges (0-80%) its 16.9 kWh battery in 30 minutes and Horwin lists a 186-mile range.\nSimilar to Verge\u2019s TS Ultra, the Senmenti 0 relies on front- and rear-facing millimeter-wave radar, dual front cameras, and a four-camera \u201csurround-view system.\u201d The captured data and footage feed the model\u2019s AI-powered Advanced Riding Assistance System (ARAS), which identifies risk factors and includes traffic sign recognition and lane detection features, Horwin says.\nThe firm also maintains that ARAS \u201ccollects data to understand the rider, preventing accidents and enhancing rider protection and confidence.\u201d That information isn\u2019t restrained to the owner\u2019s individual scooter, either. The Senmenti 0\u2019s vehicle-to-vehicle networking technology also connects to nearby Horwin models, enabling voice communication and information exchange between multiple units.\nWhile local data sharing poses its own concerns, information sent back to the manufacturer may cause more unease among U.S. customers. Recently, the Chinese company established its U.S. arm, Horwin America, in California. Only Senmenti pre-orders and deliveries will determine whether Horwin\u2019s stateside presence eases those potential data security concerns.\nInitial Senmenti 0 shipments are scheduled to begin in November and customers can secure a reservation by placing a $100 deposit. To stoke interest in the $16,800 electric scooter, Horwin offers three years of free charging and free lifetime OTA updates to the first 500 pre-order customers.\nArtificial intelligence stands to impact nearly every part of our lives, including motorcycling. If Verge and Horwin\u2019s CES presentation suggested anything, it\u2019s that the AI-aided future is closer than many of us anticipated. Now, Verge and Horwin must back up their claims by bringing the TS Ultra and Senmenti 0 to the U.S. market by late 2024. After all, AI-powered systems can\u2019t improve the safety of a bike that you can\u2019t ride.\n877-792-9455\nTell us what you love or what we need to fix."
