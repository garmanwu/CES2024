        "raw_content": "ZEISS at CES 2024\nMultifunctional Smart Glass for a wide range of application\nJena, Germany / Las Vegas, USA | 14 December 2023 | ZEISS Group\nZEISS will be at the 2024 edition of CES, the world\u2019s largest tech event, taking place from January 9\u201312 2024 in Las Vegas, to present its Multifunctional Smart Glass technology. This disruptive technology permits the optical activation of transparent media. It combines four basic functions \u2013 projection, detection, illumination and filtering to open up entirely new holographic possibilities, from smart home solutions through to augmented reality head-up displays with minimal installation space. ESA and NASA space missions have carried this trailblazing ZEISS technology on board for many years. It is also well established in the semiconductor and medical technology sectors. At the CES \u2013 Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall, W306 \u2013 ZEISS will present its industrial solutions with equipment and processes for mass production. With microoptical and holographic surfaces, they are suitable for everyday use: for more safety, interactivity, efficiency and comfort.\nReplication technology enables industrial-scale hologram production for the first time\nAt the heart of the ZEISS technology is a thin, transparent layer to which ultra-high-precision optics are attached in the smallest of spaces. It is characterized by transparency of over 92 percent combined with maximum clarity. It makes it possible for holographic technology to be used in applications where limitations of installation space, weight and costs previously stood in the way. The holographic functionality can turn any glass surface (windows of buildings, transparent screens, side windows of vehicles) into an on-demand screen for communications.\nIn the past, holograms were limited to small production runs. With the replication technology developed in the ZEISS laboratories, the fully automated duplication of a master hologram in large quantities is now possible for the first time. Roman Kleindienst, Vice President ZEISS Microoptics: \u201cThis technological milestone for holography can be compared to what the invention of letterpress printing meant for writing. That's why we call it the 'Gutenberg moment' for holography.\u201d\nHolography in the car: clear benefits for safety and comfort\nAugmented Reality HUDs have many advantages in cars: Drivers obtain all of the input they need without taking their eyes off the road. The selected information that they want or need appears within their field of vision. Other benefits are the simple functionality and additional comfort: Holographic 3D content permits\u00a0more design, branding, guidance and information functions. For example, side and rear windows can be used for eye-catching Car2X communications. It is also possible to black out window glass or make projected text and images visible only from the inside or outside. Video content is also supported. As a holographic lighting system \u2013 on brake lights of cars or two-wheeled vehicles \u2013 the ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology, with its 3D imaging, opens up new levels of design freedom for light signatures.\nHolographic augmented reality head-up displays based on ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass project important information ahead of drivers so they can keep their eyes on the road.\nWith its 3D representation, ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology opens up entirely new design possibilities for light signatures.\nZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology allows 3D control elements to be displayed as holographics \u2013 in other words, light projections \u2013 in the form of switches or controls on clean black-panel surfaces.\nZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology offers complete freedom to position a transparent camera wherever it is needed.\nZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology can turn a window pane into a wide-area light source or a projection surface \u2013 or even use it to generate energy.\nFloating switches in vehicle cockpits or smart homes\nA remarkable example of the new design possibilities presented by ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass can be seen in floating switches. These are holographic, 3D human-machine interfaces based on the unique transparent layer from ZEISS. They allow 3D control elements to be displayed on demand as holographics \u2013 in other words, light projections \u2013 in the form of switches or controls on clean black-panel surfaces. They are activated by voice or gesture control only when needed. This gives a clean, contemporary look to vehicle interiors or the controls of smart household appliances.\nTransparent camera\nZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology permits the integration of a transparent camera \u2013 a \u201cholocam\u201d \u2013 that uses coupling, decoupling and light guiding elements to divert incident light to a concealed sensor. This eliminates the need for cutouts or installation space in visible areas for cameras or sensors in the exterior for following distance alerts or parking sensors or in the interior for fatigue detection systems.\nThe ZEISS technology also delivers significant added value for entertainment electronics products such as screens and displays that have integrated cameras. For example, the placement of the holocam at the center of the screen will allow participants in videoconferences to make eye contact. The transparency of the holographic layer has only a minimal effect on the brilliance of the image reproduction.\nIt is also possible to detect spectral components as additional information to complement the visible image. The resulting data provide insights into environmental contamination such as air pollution and UV exposure.\nInterior lighting plus energy generation\nOther applications of ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology can be found especially in the smart home. For example, innovative interior lighting can be realized through special holographic decoupling elements in exterior glass that is almost indistinguishable from natural light. Window panes can be illuminated evenly over wide areas \u2013 with adjustable lighting moods to complement existing smart home solutions.\nGlass surfaces can also generate energy. The microoptical layer in the window pane absorbs incident sunlight and transmits it in concentrated form to a solar cell. This combines the advantages of conventional windows \u2013 natural light and an unrestricted view \u2013 with the additional benefit of efficient energy production.\nAs a result, the innovative ZEISS technology will make surfaces available for power generation in the future that could not previously serve that purpose: office building facades and windows of highrise apartment buildings and other residential housing. This creates new opportunities to capture energy anywhere that glass panels are used.\nSystem technology provider instead of hardware producer\nThe innovative ZEISS technology has the potential to completely rethink parts and components in terms of design and function in many application fields. As a system provider, ZEISS does not wish to produce the components itself. Instead it will provide the unique industrial-scale replication of holograms in the form of a transparent layer to manufacturers or suppliers who wish to enhance their products and provide them with new functions. For this purpose, ZEISS is creating an entire ecosystem: from the first step through to the finished hardware, along with unrivalled advisory services and design support.\nNadine Tusche\nMarketing and Communications\nZEISS Microoptics\nAbout ZEISS\nZEISS is an internationally leading technology enterprise operating in the fields of optics and optoelectronics.

        "raw_content": "Everything About Metrology\nZEISS at CES 2024\nMultifunctional Smart Glass for a wide range of application\nZEISS will be at the 2024 edition of CES, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest tech event, taking place from January 9\u00e2\u20ac\u201c12 2024 in Las Vegas, to present its Multifunctional Smart Glass technology. This disruptive technology permits the optical activation of transparent media. It combines four basic functions \u00e2\u20ac\u201c projection, detection, illumination and filtering to open up entirely new holographic possibilities, from smart home solutions through to augmented reality head-up displays with minimal installation space. ESA and NASA space missions have carried this trailblazing ZEISS technology on board for many years. It is also well established in the semiconductor and medical technology sectors. At the CES \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Las Vegas Convention Center West Hall, W306 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c ZEISS will present its industrial solutions with equipment and processes for mass production. With microoptical and holographic surfaces, they are suitable for everyday use: for more safety, interactivity, efficiency and comfort.\nReplication technology enables industrial-scale hologram production for the first time\nAt the heart of the ZEISS technology is a thin, transparent layer to which ultra-high-precision optics are attached in the smallest of spaces. It is characterized by transparency of over 92 percent combined with maximum clarity. It makes it possible for holographic technology to be used in applications where limitations of installation space, weight and costs previously stood in the way. The holographic functionality can turn any glass surface (windows of buildings, transparent screens, side windows of vehicles) into an on-demand screen for communications.\nIn the past, holograms were limited to small production runs. With the replication technology developed in the ZEISS laboratories, the fully automated duplication of a master hologram in large quantities is now possible for the first time. Roman Kleindienst, Vice President ZEISS Microoptics: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153This technological milestone for holography can be compared to what the invention of letterpress printing meant for writing. That\u2019s why we call it the \u2018Gutenberg moment\u2019 for holography.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nHolography in the car: clear benefits for safety and comfort\nAugmented Reality HUDs have many advantages in cars: Drivers obtain all of the input they need without taking their eyes off the road. The selected information that they want or need appears within their field of vision. Other benefits are the simple functionality and additional comfort: Holographic 3D content permits\u00c2\u00a0more design, branding, guidance and information functions. For example, side and rear windows can be used for eye-catching Car2X communications. It is also possible to black out window glass or make projected text and images visible only from the inside or outside. Video content is also supported. As a holographic lighting system \u00e2\u20ac\u201c on brake lights of cars or two-wheeled vehicles \u00e2\u20ac\u201c the ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology, with its 3D imaging, opens up new levels of design freedom for light signatures.\nFloating switches in vehicle cockpits or smart homes\nA remarkable example of the new design possibilities presented by ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass can be seen in floating switches. These are holographic, 3D human-machine interfaces based on the unique transparent layer from ZEISS. They allow 3D control elements to be displayed on demand as holographics \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in other words, light projections \u00e2\u20ac\u201c in the form of switches or controls on clean black-panel surfaces. They are activated by voice or gesture control only when needed. This gives a clean, contemporary look to vehicle interiors or the controls of smart household appliances.\nTransparent camera\nZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology permits the integration of a transparent camera \u00e2\u20ac\u201c a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153holocam\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd \u00e2\u20ac\u201c that uses coupling, decoupling and light guiding elements to divert incident light to a concealed sensor. This eliminates the need for cutouts or installation space in visible areas for cameras or sensors in the exterior for following distance alerts or parking sensors or in the interior for fatigue detection systems.\nThe ZEISS technology also delivers significant added value for entertainment electronics products such as screens and displays that have integrated cameras. For example, the placement of the holocam at the center of the screen will allow participants in videoconferences to make eye contact. The transparency of the holographic layer has only a minimal effect on the brilliance of the image reproduction.\nIt is also possible to detect spectral components as additional information to complement the visible image. The resulting data provide insights into environmental contamination such as air pollution and UV exposure.\nInterior lighting plus energy generation\nOther applications of ZEISS Multifunctional Smart Glass technology can be found especially in the smart home. For example, innovative interior lighting can be realized through special holographic decoupling elements in exterior glass that is almost indistinguishable from natural light. Window panes can be illuminated evenly over wide areas \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with adjustable lighting moods to complement existing smart home solutions.\nGlass surfaces can also generate energy. The microoptical layer in the window pane absorbs incident sunlight and transmits it in concentrated form to a solar cell. This combines the advantages of conventional windows \u00e2\u20ac\u201c natural light and an unrestricted view \u00e2\u20ac\u201c with the additional benefit of efficient energy production.\nAs a result, the innovative ZEISS technology will make surfaces available for power generation in the future that could not previously serve that purpose: office building facades and windows of highrise apartment buildings and other residential housing. This creates new opportunities to capture energy anywhere that glass panels are used.\nSystem technology provider instead of hardware producer\nThe innovative ZEISS technology has the potential to completely rethink parts and components in terms of design and function in many application fields. As a system provider, ZEISS does not wish to produce the components itself. Instead it will provide the unique industrial-scale replication of holograms in the form of a transparent layer to manufacturers or suppliers who wish to enhance their products and provide them with new functions. For this purpose, ZEISS is creating an entire ecosystem: from the first step through to the finished hardware, along with unrivalled advisory services and design support.\nPost navigation\nWritten by:\nSouvik Mitra\n1,307\nPosts\nRelated Posts\nJenoptik introduces a new diode laser and presents a versatile range of photonic solutions at SPIE BiOS and Photonics West\nIMTEX FORMING 2024: Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Largest Exhibition on Metal Forming and Manufacturing Technologies Gets Enthusiastic Response from the Manufacturing Community\nCarl Zeiss India Redefines Manufacturing Standards at IMTEX 2024, Empowering \u2018Make in India\u2019 with Direct Access to High-End Metrology Solutions\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

This layer, with transparency exceeding 92 percent, serves as the canvas for holographic projections and can turn any glass surface into an on-demand screen for communications with maximum clarity.\nZeiss\n\u201cThis technological milestone for holography can be compared to what the invention of letterpress printing meant for writing,\u201d said Roman Kleindienst, Vice President of Zeiss Microoptics, in a statement, describing the technology as the \u201cGutenberg moment\u201d for holography.\nThe replication technology introduced by Zeiss breaks the conventional constraints of small production runs, enabling the large-scale production of holograms for the first time. This technology has already found applications in space missions conducted by ESA and NASA, as well as in the semiconductor and medical technology sectors.\nBeyond the screen\nOne of the most intriguing applications of Zeiss's technology is the \"holocam,\" a transparent camera seamlessly integrated into glass panels. The holocam leverages coupling, decoupling, and light-guiding elements to divert incident light to a concealed sensor.\nThis technology eliminates the need for visible cutouts or installation space for cameras and sensors, introducing a sleek, unobtrusive design, and could find its place in parking sensors of cars and driver fatigue detection systems.\nAnother interesting application of the holocam would be videoconferencing where placing the holocam at the center of the screen would allow participants to make eye contact naturally, with the technology\u2019s brilliant transparency causing the slightest of effects on image reproduction.\nZeiss envisions its technology being utilized not only for entertainment purposes but also for environmental data collection, including monitoring air pollution and UV exposure.\nZeiss\nHolograms Everywhere\nBesides the transparent camera, Zeiss will also showcase augmented Reality Head-Up Displays (HUDs) for cars at CES 2024, offering drivers a seamless and safe interface for crucial information without diverting attention from the road.\nThe technology could extend beyond dashboard displays, transforming side and rear windows into platforms for Car2X communications, blacking out window glass, or showcasing projected text and images visible only from specific angles.\nBeyond the automotive sector, Zeiss sees potential in smart homes, where holographic 3D control elements can appear on flat surfaces, activated by gestures or voice commands. The transparent layer could also facilitate interior lighting innovations and energy generation through the absorption of sunlight, presenting new possibilities for power generation in office building facades and residential windows.\nZeiss is positioning itself as a system provider rather than a hardware producer and aims to offer OEMs the means to enhance their products with this groundbreaking technology."
