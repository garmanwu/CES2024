The Health Foundation Platform makes it easy and quick for health tech companies to integrate clinical grade AI which analyses medically relevant expressed behavior into their products.\nThis groundbreaking technology uses mobile phones or tablets running advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze facial expressions and vocal behavior to provide digital health companies and their customers with deeper, more measurable and reliable customer insights more securely and faster than ever before.\n\"By combining computer vision and natural language processing, our Health Foundation Platform can decode the nuances of human emotion and behavior in real-time,\" says Professor Michel Valstar, Founding CEO of Blueskeye AI. \"Our technology allows us to surface insights that would be impossible to detect with the naked eye or ear, and which are difficult to both quantify and measure.\"\nUsing the Health Foundation Platform companies can monitor customer engagement, satisfaction, and even spot the early warning signs of serious illness. The powerful clinical grade AI can be integrated rapidly into digital therapeutics platforms, clinical trial or treatment companion apps, extending their capabilities, making them more powerful and allowing additional services to be offered.\nHow it worksThe Health Foundation Platform uses machine learning embedded in mobile phones or tablets to monitor changes to peoples' facial and vocal behavior whilst they undertake one of a number of specialist tasks. This data can be used to identify and track emotions. The Platform can also assess fatigue, pain, muscular atrophy, anxiety and depression. It could even identify the early signs of conditions which have an effect on the face or voice, such as, Autism, ADHD, Parkinson's or Alzheimer's.\nBlueSkeye collaborates closely with digital health companies to design the optimal assessment for a digital interaction with the user. By undertaking the assessment customers generate rich behavioral data. BlueSkeye's specialist staff benchmark this data at scale against best current measurement methods to establish the extent to which the technology will reliably enable or enhance the company's offer. This\u00a0rigorous approach ensures BlueSkeye's face and voice analysis AI is suitable for digital health applications before deployment.\nThe Platform's core technology is already in use in the UK's National Health Service (NHS) where the company is undertaking a clinical trial of its use for assessing anxiety and depression amongst pregnant women.\nChief Investigator, Dr Neil Nixon, Associate Professor in Psychiatry at the University of Nottingham and Consultant Lead for the Nottingham Specialist Depression Service described the trial as:\n\"An important trial, assessing the potential for artificial intelligence to detect early indications of perinatal depression. Our partners, including expert patients and clinicians, continue to shape the development of this technology so that positive results will also translate into more effective NHS care.\"\nBlueSkeye AI is also working with a number of global automotive manufacturers on the integration of the technology into the next generation of intelligent cabins. BlueSkeye also works with FMCG, social robotics and fitness and wellbeing hardware providers.\n\"By using BlueSkeye's clinically validated AI, digital health companies can unlock new levels of insight and understanding of their customers,\" says Professor Michel Valstar, Founding CEO of Blueskeye AI. \"This paves the way for more personalized, proactive and predictive healthcare as we usher in a new era of next-generation, AI-enabled digital health and wellbeing.\"\nBlueSkeye will be giving demos of The Health Foundation Platform at CES 2024.\nTo learn more about BlueSkeye visit the website at https://www.blueskeye.com or stop by BlueSkeye's at Booth 8935 LVCC North Hall.\nAbout BlueSkeye AIProfessor Valstar co-founded BlueSkeye AI in April 2019, with Dr Anthony Brown (CTO) and\u00a0 Chief Machine Learning and Software Engineer Dr Timur Almaev. BlueSkeye's products build on over 18 years of research by Prof Michel Valstar and his team in the Affective Computing (AC) and Social Signal Processing (SSP) field. Valstar has published over 100 peer-reviewed publications, which have been cited over 17,000 times and an h-index of 51, making him the second most cited person in the field of SSP.\nBlueSkeye launched its first product, the software development kit (SDK) B-Social, at CES in Las Vegas in January 2021. B-Social helps developers use the company's software to create more interactive social robots. BlueSkeye also launched an SDK for use in the automotive industry earlier this year, reacting to strong demand from this sector for improved in-cabin AI sensing.

Linked to an app, it provides you with a list of choices if it isn't entirely sure which bird is feasting that day.\nBird Buddy can also provide a live video feed using the camera inside the feeder so you can watch for yourself and save clips and images of the visiting avians.\nThe base model is $239 which is steep for a bird feeder with a smart doorbell inside and you'd want the solar panel roof for an additional $299 unless you want to charge every week.\nDespite the cost our reviewer liked Bird Buddy in part due to a lack of ongoing subscription fee and high quality video.\nThe Flappie AI-powered cat flap\nA post shared by flappie (@flappiedoors)\nA photo posted by on\nFlappie is the latest smart pet technology to embrace AI vision. The device has motion sensors and AI vision technology to spot when your feline friend tries to bring small animals into the house.\nThe Swiss startup says the AI-powered cat door isn\u2019t perfect in every instance, but can correctly identify whether your pet has prey in its mouth in at least 90% of cases.\nIf the AI in Flappie detects a \"gift\" then it locks the door and won't allow the cat inside until it drops its prey. The company says the goal is to teach cats not to bring the creatures into the house.\nOne of the founders did admit that a clever cat could drop the mouse, get the door open and then pick it back up and make a run for it, but that on the whole, it should work.\nIt can also detect a microchip and ensure the cat only opens for a specific pet. It'll launch in the US later this year after an initial rollout in Europe.\nLG\u2019s home-patrolling AI robot\nAnnounced before the event, the LG \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d robot is a small device that can use AI vision technology to monitor pets and home appliances.\nIt patrols your home for any issues, fixes what it can and where it can\u2019t deal with it the cute little gadget reports the issue to its owners.\nLG claims it can also read human emotions, and monitor your home environment \u2014 with temperature, humidity and air quality on the agenda \u2014 to ensure everything is as efficient as possible.\nThe bot is also capable of recognizing your face and voice, ready to meet you at the front door when you arrive home. Part security patrol, part butler, it can also manage and control your smart appliances.\nSamsung's Ballie home robot\nSamsung's new Ballie robot is proof of its commitment to go \"all in\" on AI at CES 2024. The rolling robot has a built-in projector that can display content while it rolls.\nThe advanced AI in Ballie can greet you at the door but also come to you when you call to it. And it can project content when you ask it.\nIt has built-in front and rear cameras to detect and analyze its surroundings and can even learn recurring user patterns to automate various functions.\nAI-powered lights for gaming sessions\nSmart lighting isn't a new thing, we've had LED strips able to react to the environment or bulbs linked to Alexa for some time. This year at CES it is getting an upgrade thanks to advances in generative and vision AI.\nGovee is one of the companies involved in AI lighting, revealing its upgraded Gaming Sync Box Kit 2 and Neon Rope Light 2 at CES 2024.\nLinked to your gaming PC or console, its CogniGlow algorithm responds to what is happening in the game and adapts the lighting for a more immersive experience.\nLighting to monitor your mood\nNobi has unveiled its smart ceiling lamp that uses AI vision technology to detect and prevent falls, monitor health and even track activity patterns.\nIt is being pitched as a tool for the senior living and mobility markets and will be available in the U.S. this year.\nLepro has also announced a new suite of AI-powered home lighting products that use natural language processing to analyze voice commands and tailor the lights based on what you ask, rather than having to set the tone in an app.\nThey can also use facial recognition to analyze the emotional state of a user and change the lighting to match their mood.\nSnore tackling smart pillow\nThe Motion Pillow has been given a wireless upgrade. This is a health technology device that claims to be able to improve sleep and tackle snoring.\nThe AI-powered pillow includes a wireless device that monitors sleep sounds, detects snoring and activates airbags in the pillow to reposition the user's head.\nThe company says being able to move the head improves airflow and removes any disturbances in the nose without causing sleep interruption.\nThe Motion Pillow is normally $699, a lot for a pillow and sound box. At the moment, during CES 2024 it has been reduced to $420 on the Motion Pillow website.\nA mood-boosting smart mirror\nThe Baracoda BMind is an AI-powered smart mirror that will not only tell you that you really are the fairest of them all, but improve your mood at the same time.\nUsing natural language processing to analyze the sentiment of whoever is staring at their reflection, it can provide affirmations and visuals to boost their mood.\nBMind's AI looks through expressions, gestures and tones, adapting to what it determines to be the mood of the user. It can then provide a light therapy session or a guided meditation session to manage stress.\nIt can also help you brush your teeth with an on-screen guide, analyze your skin and monitor the temperature in the bath water. Coming out in the U.S. later this year, it will be priced somewhere up to $1000.\nSamsung fridge turned AI home hub\nSamsung has gone \u201call-in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its phones and home appliances. This includes a new AI Family Hub+ technology that is designed to bring together different appliances.\nit is initially being built into the new Bespoke 4-door flex refrigerator, unveiled at CES. This includes internal cameras and AI vision capable of identifying individual food items. It can then suggest recipes based on what you have in stock.\nAI grill that can cook a steak in minutes\nTom's Guide had the chance to see the SeerGrills Perfecta at CES 2024. This smart grill can ensure you get a perfect cook on anything and do so 10 times faster than other grills. With 360 degree cooking, it promises an even cook without the need to flip a burger or steak, according to the company.\nPerfecta uses dual vertical infrared burners to pulse and move horizontally, reaching as high as 1,652\u00b0 F. The result is a high-tech grill that can cook a 1-inch ribeye steak in as little as 90 seconds and four chicken breasts in 2 minutes and 30 seconds.\nIt uses artificial intelligence to monitor all aspects of the food, environment and cooking process. This includes the temperature and texture of the food.\nRobot vacuum phone home\nrobot vacuum maker Roborock has a new flagship vacuum and mp called the S8 MaxV Ultra that includes a voice assistant, robot arm and video calling functionality.\nLaunching at CES 2024, the S8 MaxV can be controlled without the need for another device \u2014 just speak to it and tell it what to clean.\nThe built-in camera allows for AI-powered obstacle avoidance in addition to ability to call its owner, or have the owner call in remotely.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

I'm super excited. The annual Consumer Electronics Show is always at the very beginning of the year and for me is a great measure of how far Blueskeye AI has come as a company. For our first CES in 2022 we were hosted by the UK's Department of International Trade, with a small desk in their pavilion in the startup section. We didn't have a well-defined product and were testing the market - and came home with a clear direction because of the large number of potential customers we spoke to! In 2023 we graduated to the main CES hall, with a stand in the brand-new Digital Health Zone. It was exciting and we got absolutely constant footfall, with lots of interest from the automotive pharmaceutical industry, exactly the direction we had chosen based on CES 2022.\nThis year, 2024, we're on a stand that's four size that of last year, with double the number of staff manning it, three super well prepared demos, professional videos, stand design, and social media campaigns. Perhaps most importantly, we've already loaded up our diary with scheduled demos with our target customers. CES is where we go to connect with our existing and potential customers, and by the looks of things, 2024 is going to be a good one for Blueskeye, bucking the trend of other startups in the current difficult economic environment.
