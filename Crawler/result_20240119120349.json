         "raw_content": "Wallonia, the francophone region of Belgium, long ago recognised the need to revitalise its post-industrial economy.\u00a0In 2005, with a nod to the post-war bailout of Europe by the US government, Wallonia devised and began to implement what it calls 'the Marshall Plan'.\nThis was an ambitious scheme for the promotion of public-private sector synergies in a number of high-value-added industry sectors. The aim was to facilitate the region\u2019s export capacity, while encouraging new partners and investor companies, some of whom may otherwise have overlooked Wallonia\u2019s potential. Were they to have, it would not have been for the lack of a strong story to tell.\nAdvertisement\nBelgium has a complex history (and perhaps a complex future). But a part of that tapestry is Wallonia\u2019s identity as one of Europe\u2019s major hubs in the industrial age. The steel mills and factories are not yet silent: Arcelor Mittal remains an important investor and employer in the region. But it has been long understood that Wallonia needs to transpose its educated workforce, strategic location and techno-industrial heritage into a new paradigm of industry if it is to thrive and compete in the 21st century and beyond. This means taking advantage of its not inconsiderable assets.\nAWEX support\nAmong Wallonia's assets is its proximity to other important European markets, including the rest of Belgium (Flanders), Germany, Luxembourg, France, the Netherlands and the UK. Karelle Lambert, business development manager of AWEX, Wallonia\u2019s investment and export promotion agency, points out that companies based in Belgium have access to some 60 million consumers within a four-hour road journey.\nBelgian workers also possess some of the best language skills in Europe (and some of the highest productivity rates).\u00a0But a clincher, arguably, is the support that AWEX is prepared to give to investors and exporters in its efforts to secure the region\u2019s continued exposure and competitiveness.\nOne of the most important industry groupings for the region is the pharmaceuticals and life sciences sector, worth about \u20ac3bn per annum to Wallonia, and employing nearly 15,000 people. A number of world-renowned players in the industry have established major operations in Wallonia, including vaccine manufacturer GSK Biologicals, biopharmaceutical and medical device maker Baxter, and proton therapy provider IBA.\nIn part this is due to the efforts of BioWin, what AWEX calls a 'health competitiveness cluster', which facilitates partnerships between about 500 players in the private sector, in academia and at research centres. But BioWin also invests: to date, providing funding worth more than \u20ac72m to 21 projects.\nAdvertisement\nKytoZyme success story\nOne recipient of BioWin funding is KytoZyme; 10 years old and a spin-off of a project initiated within the department of botany at the University of Li\u00e8ge. The company\u2019s products are the result of innovative research into biopolymers extracted from fungi.\nKytoZyme\u2019s main product is what it calls KiOmedicine, an ultra-pure chitosan produced from a non-animal source, which is being formulated for a number of applications including wound treatment, biosurgery, vaccine and drug delivery, and ophthalmology. But the company sees opportunities outside of the medical sector, for example, in cosmetics, and food and beverage companies. One application of the chitosan is as a stabilising agent in wines.\nIn relative terms, KytoZyme is a small company (the majority of shares are in the hands of the Meldagh family,\u00a0a local Walloon dynasty). Its first plant was up and running in 2006; it employs 50 people, 12 of whom are involved in production.\u00a0It also boasts a strong in-house regulatory affairs team and its first significant sales were achieved last year. They were in the region of \u20ac600,000,\u00a0but its portfolio of customers is more than 100 strong.\nThe government of Wallonia has invested about \u20ac3m in KytoZyme. According to the company\u2019s head of marketing, Sandrine Gautier, the fact that its core competence coincides with one of the clusters that AWEX is keen to support has not in any way altered its strategy. She says: \u201cWithout the funding that the government has provided, and the networking opportunities, it is doubtful that we would be where we are today.\u201d\nEurogentec happy\nKytoZyme is at the larger end of the small to medium-sized enterprise spectrum. Good manufacturing practice\u00a0contract manufacturer Eurogentec, on the other hand, with annual sales in 2010 in excess of \u20ac50m and employing about 400 people, is a very differently sized company. Eurogentec has three manufacturing sites outside Belgium; two in the US and one in Japan. And in October of last year, Japanese chemicals manufacturer Kaneka acquired a majority share in the company, having previously indicated an interest in its bioproducts division.\nBut, says head of sales Pascal Bolon, the company\u2019s current location on the outskirts of Li\u00e8ge remains the optimum site for its headquarters. \u201cWhy Li\u00e8ge? There are a number of reasons. One is the stability of employees. There simply aren\u2019t the same employment opportunities here as there are in some other locations, so job hopping isn\u2019t an option. Also, we\u2019re able to draw on the resources and technicians available at the nearby University of Li\u00e8ge, which provides many of our PhDs,\u201d he says.\nAnother quality on Mr Bolon's list of pluses: Wallonia has coined the phrase \u2018biologistics\u2019 to refer to the capacity of its airports, in particular Li\u00e8ge airport, to handle volatile pharmaceutical and biological products, as well as raw materials (it is also the European hub of freight carrier TNT Express).\nOutsiders welcomes\nEurogentec and KytoZyme are, of course, Walloon companies in origin. But there are good reasons for foreign companies to look at the region. These include land availability and investment incentives worth up to 35% on the purchase of land and buildings, new equipment and non-tangible investments, including patents, licenses and technical expertise.\nBut the Walloons will say that affinity with their aspiration to succeed will determine whether potential investors are prepared to offer something to a region that almost certainly has something to offer them.\nThe cost\u00a0of this report was underwritten by the Wallonia Export & Investment Agency.
