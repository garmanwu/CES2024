This enables Iontra\u2019s customers, including those in industrial and electric vehicle (EV) applications, to realize superior battery performance with a significantly lower carbon footprint and reduced total cost of ownership.\nIontra: thinking outside the battery\nIontra\u2019s unique advanced battery sensing and charging method is predictive and\u00a0responsive, proactively protecting the battery while charging and discharging. Iontra eradicates the most concerning failure modes of batteries, plating and dendrite formation, which cause safety issues and limit battery performance.\nIontra is chemistry agnostic and proven to concurrently increase battery cycle life and charge speed by greater than 200 percent, support cold weather charging to -20\u00b0C, and create a safer charge overall, without changing the design of battery cells or packs.\nJeff Granato, President and CEO, Iontra, said:\nA more secure and sustainable energy future depends on the ability to maximize the use of the limited critical supply of battery minerals, materials, and other components, and Iontra helps to stretch those finite resources.\n\u201cFulfilling our mission to remove the greatest hurdles facing this global energy transition, we are on the path to make Iontra\u2019s affordable charging solution available to the industry and are encouraged by the excitement and continued support of our customers and investors.\u201d\nSolving a global challenge\nGlobally, private industry and governments are investing billions of dollars to research new battery technologies in support of electrification and a lower carbon footprint, representing one of the greatest energy transition efforts in history. However, these investments struggle to meet the urgent need to address short and long-term supply chain issues associated with the dramatic increase in the demand for battery minerals and materials, nor do they address plating and dendrite formation, as Iontra does.\nExacerbating these challenges, current charge management solutions from companies such as Analog Devices, Qualcomm, and Texas Instruments are simply unable to deliver the kind of substantial performance improvements the market needs, and which Iontra\u2019s approach enables.\nValidation\nIontra\u2019s breakthrough charge control technology is validated by approximately three million cycling hours performed in-house, testing dozens of battery types and the stability of the system under various charge conditions for quality, reliability, and durability. Iontra\u2019s technology has also been tested by four independent research labs, including National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Novonix, UL Solutions, and\u00a0University of Michigan.\nDavid Schroeder, CTO, Volta Energy Technologies, said:\nIncremental efficiency improvements will not address our climate and energy supply chain challenges, which is why Volta is again throwing its support behind Iontra\u2019s transformational battery charge control technology.\n\u201cThe way batteries are charged has largely been overlooked in the race to improve battery performance, but Iontra represents a radically new, and proven, approach that policy makers and product manufacturers should pay close attention to.\u201d\nJohn Staudinger, Managing Director, Riverstone, said:\nThe economic and environmental math is simple.\n\u201cBy replacing the existing charge control chip in a product with Iontra\u2019s at the same or lesser cost, the increase in cycle life, charge speed, and other performance benefits are realized instantly.\u00a0Iontra not only improves your product but removes the need for vast amounts of new battery materials.\u201d\nAbout Iontra:\nIontra is a\u00a0Colorado-based battery innovation company that dramatically improves the charge speed, cycle life, capacity utilization, cold weather charging, and safety of all lithium batteries. Iontra\u2019s breakthrough solution delivers the performance that next generation batteries are promising to deliver years from now.

The additional Series B funding is led by prominent energy sector investors Volta Energy Technologies and Riverstone with additional support from Flag Asset Management and others. JPMorgan Chase assisted Iontra by acting as the placement agent for the financing.\nThis funding will advance Iontra's position as a\u00a0fabless supplier of a low-cost and small-footprint battery charger microcontroller (MCU) for\u00a0battery-powered consumer products such as power tools, smartphones, hearables, and wearables. With Iontra's MCU, product manufacturers will be able to integrate Iontra's technology quickly and easily into their products to unlock the full potential of their batteries while\u00a0reducing their Bill-of-Materials (BOM) costs. Iontra has opened chip design centers in Dallas and Bangalore, India to develop the initial MCU, and is collaborating with leading companies in the semiconductor supply chain to deliver a robust and reliable solution to customers.\nIontra maximizes the use of critical battery minerals and materials for a more secure and sustainable energy future.\nTo facilitate easy adoption in current battery-powered applications, Iontra offers a proven firmware solution that can run seamlessly on MCUs in products today. This enables Iontra's customers, including those in industrial and electric vehicle (EV) applications, to realize superior battery performance with a significantly lower carbon footprint and reduced total cost of ownership.\nIontra: thinking outside the battery\nIontra's unique advanced battery sensing and charging method is predictive and\u00a0responsive, proactively protecting the battery while charging and discharging. Iontra eradicates the most concerning failure modes of batteries, plating and dendrite formation, which cause safety issues and limit battery performance.\nIontra is chemistry agnostic and proven to concurrently increase battery cycle life and charge speed by greater than 200 percent, support cold weather charging to -20\u00b0C, and create a safer charge overall, without changing the design of battery cells or packs.\n\"A more secure and sustainable energy future depends on the ability to maximize the use of the limited critical supply of battery minerals, materials, and other components, and Iontra helps to stretch those finite resources,\" said Jeff Granato, President and CEO, Iontra. \"Fulfilling our mission to remove the greatest hurdles facing this global energy transition, we are on the path to make Iontra's affordable charging solution available to the industry and are encouraged by the excitement and continued support of our customers and investors.\"\nSolving a global challenge\nGlobally, private industry and governments are investing billions of dollars to research new battery technologies in support of electrification and a lower carbon footprint, representing one of the greatest energy transition efforts in history. However, these investments struggle to meet the urgent need to address short and long-term supply chain issues associated with the dramatic increase in the demand for battery minerals and materials, nor do they address plating and dendrite formation, as Iontra does.\nExacerbating these challenges, current charge management solutions from companies such as Analog Devices, Qualcomm, and Texas Instruments are simply unable to deliver the kind of substantial performance improvements the market needs, and which Iontra's approach enables.\nValidation\nIontra's breakthrough charge control technology is validated by approximately three million cycling hours performed in-house, testing dozens of battery types and the stability of the system under various charge conditions for quality, reliability, and durability. Iontra's technology has also been tested by four independent research labs, including National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Novonix, UL Solutions, and University of Michigan.\n\"Incremental efficiency improvements will not address our climate and energy supply chain challenges, which is why Volta is again throwing its support behind Iontra's transformational battery charge control technology,\" said David Schroeder, CTO, Volta Energy Technologies. \"The way batteries are charged has largely been overlooked in the race to improve battery performance, but Iontra represents a radically new, and proven, approach that policy makers and product manufacturers should pay close attention to.\"\n\"The economic and environmental math is simple,\" said John Staudinger, Managing Director, Riverstone. \"By replacing the existing charge control chip in a product with Iontra's at the same or lesser cost, the increase in cycle life, charge speed, and other performance benefits are realized instantly.\u00a0Iontra not only improves your product but removes the need for vast amounts of new battery materials.\"\nAbout Iontra:\nIontra is a Colorado-based battery innovation company that dramatically improves the charge speed, cycle life, capacity utilization, cold weather charging, and safety of all lithium batteries. Iontra's breakthrough solution delivers the performance that next generation batteries are promising to deliver years from now. The company has its offices, R&D labs, and battery cycler fleets across multiple facilities in Colorado, Texas, and India.

The\u00a0additional\u00a0Series B funding is led by prominent energy sector investors Volta Energy Technologies and Riverstone with additional support from Flag Asset Management and others. JPMorgan Chase assisted Iontra by acting as the placement agent for the financing.\nThis funding will advance Iontra\u2019s position as a fabless supplier of a low-cost and small-footprint battery charger microcontroller (MCU) for battery-powered consumer products such as power tools, smartphones, hearables, and wearables. With Iontra\u2019s MCU, product manufacturers will be able to integrate Iontra\u2019s technology quickly and easily into their products to unlock the full potential of their batteries while\u00a0reducing their Bill-of-Materials (BOM) costs. Iontra has opened chip design centers in Dallas and Bangalore, India to develop the initial MCU, and is collaborating with leading companies in the semiconductor supply chain to deliver a robust and reliable solution to customers.\nTo facilitate easy adoption in current battery-powered applications, Iontra offers a proven firmware solution that can run seamlessly on MCUs in products today. This enables Iontra\u2019s customers, including those in industrial and electric vehicle (EV) applications, to realize superior battery performance with a significantly lower carbon footprint and reduced total cost of ownership.\nIontra: thinking outside the battery\nIontra\u2019s unique advanced battery sensing and charging method is predictive and responsive, proactively protecting the battery while charging and discharging. Iontra eradicates the most concerning failure modes of batteries, plating and dendrite formation, which cause safety issues and limit battery performance.\nIontra is chemistry agnostic and proven to concurrently increase battery cycle life and charge speed by greater than 200 percent, support cold weather charging to -20\u00b0C, and create a safer charge overall, without changing the design of battery cells or packs.\n\u201cA more secure and sustainable energy future depends on the ability to maximize the use of the limited critical supply of battery minerals, materials, and other components, and Iontra helps to stretch those finite resources,\u201d\u00a0said Jeff Granato, President and CEO, Iontra. \u201cFulfilling our mission to remove the greatest hurdles facing this global energy transition, we are on the path to make Iontra\u2019s affordable charging solution available to the industry and are encouraged by the excitement and continued support of our customers and investors.\u201d\nSolving a global challenge\nGlobally, private industry and governments are investing billions of dollars to research new battery technologies in support of electrification and a lower carbon footprint, representing one of the greatest energy transition efforts in history. However, these investments struggle to meet the urgent need to address short and long-term supply chain issues associated with the dramatic increase in the demand for battery minerals and materials, nor do they address plating and dendrite formation, as Iontra does.\nExacerbating these challenges, current charge management solutions from companies such as Analog Devices, Qualcomm, and Texas Instruments are simply unable to deliver the kind of substantial performance improvements the market needs, and which Iontra\u2019s approach enables.\nValidation\nIontra\u2019s breakthrough charge control technology is validated by approximately three million cycling hours performed in-house, testing dozens of battery types and the stability of the system under various charge conditions for quality, reliability, and durability. Iontra\u2019s technology has also been tested by four independent research labs, including National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Novonix, UL Solutions, and University of Michigan.\n\u201cIncremental efficiency improvements will not address our climate and energy supply chain challenges, which is why Volta is again throwing its support behind Iontra\u2019s transformational battery charge control technology,\u201d\u00a0said David Schroeder, CTO, Volta Energy Technologies.\u00a0\u201cThe way batteries are charged has largely been overlooked in the race to improve battery performance, but Iontra represents a radically new, and proven, approach that policy makers and product manufacturers should pay close attention to.\u201d\n\u201cThe economic and environmental math is simple,\u201d\u00a0said John Staudinger, Managing Director, Riverstone.\u00a0\u201cBy replacing the existing charge control chip in a product with Iontra\u2019s at the same or lesser cost, the increase in cycle life, charge speed, and other performance benefits are realized instantly.\u00a0Iontra not only improves your product but removes the need for vast amounts of new battery materials.\u201d\nRecommended Reading\nPosts\nTime for Transformational Change\nThe battery industry has come a long way in recent years, but the need for enhanced battery performance remains a\u2026\nPosts\nThe Future, Faster\nThinking Outside the Battery\u00a0 The ARPA-E Energy Innovation Summit\u00a0is an annual event that brings together innovators, investors, and government representatives\u2026\nPosts\nTransformational Change in The Battery Industry Optimizing Charge for Sustainability and Convenience\nThe battery industry has come a long way in recent years, but the need for enhanced battery performance remains a\u2026\nLet\u2019s talk.\nLearn more about Iontra and how our proprietary charging technology can dramatically enhance your products \u2014 and drive increased market share.\nContact\nIontra advancements are driven by data and validated by objective industry authorities.\nResources\nSocial\nLearn more about our Iontra advancements are driven by data and validated by objective industry authorities. process\nValidation Labs\nResources\nSocial"

As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Both features will be demoed At FETC 2024 in Orlando.\nORLANDO, Fla., Jan. 17, 2024 \u2013 LG Business Solutions USA, a leading innovator of cutting-edge display technologies, today announced its Google Enterprise Devices Licensing Agreement (EDLA) certification for the new CreateBoard (TR3DK-BM). The interactive display will now come with Android 13 pre-installed and access to the Google Play store when it begins shipping this spring. According to LG Director of Education Victoria Sanville, the company pursued Google\u2019s EDLA certification to streamline CreateBoard experiences in response to requests by educators who are avid users of Google\u2019s app suite*, which is becoming increasingly popular in education environments.\nA demo of the new CreateBoard will be on display at FETC 2024 Booth #1849 from Jan. 23-26 at the Orange County Convention Center in Orlando, Florida.\n\u201cWe are always looking for ways to make our displays and technologies easier to use and more functional for users, and the feedback we\u2019ve received from the education community made it clear that native access to Google for Education Apps will help teachers better manage their time, their classrooms and their lessons,\u201d Sanville said. \u201cWith the new Google EDLA certification, schools will have access to the full range of Google Play Store apps primarily used for education.\u00a0The certification also helps reduce any setup time or learning curve users might encounter and makes device management simple for IT or technology staff.\u201d\nGoogle Mobile Services is a collection of Google applications that support functionality across devices. These apps work together seamlessly to ensure your device provides a great user experience right out of the box.\nEach new model includes the Google Play store, making it easy to access a large variety of verified, third-party apps curated by Google.

The additional Series B funding is led by prominent energy sector investors Volta Energy Technologies and Riverstone with additional support from Flag Asset Management and others. JPMorgan Chase assisted Iontra by acting as the placement agent for the financing.\nThis funding will advance Iontra's position as a\u00a0fabless supplier of a low-cost and small-footprint battery charger microcontroller (MCU) for\u00a0battery-powered consumer products such as power tools, smartphones, hearables, and wearables. With Iontra's MCU, product manufacturers will be able to integrate Iontra's technology quickly and easily into their products to unlock the full potential of their batteries while\u00a0reducing their Bill-of-Materials (BOM) costs. Iontra has opened chip design centers in Dallas and Bangalore, India to develop the initial MCU, and is collaborating with leading companies in the semiconductor supply chain to deliver a robust and reliable solution to customers.\nTo facilitate easy adoption in current battery-powered applications, Iontra offers a proven firmware solution that can run seamlessly on MCUs in products today. This enables Iontra's customers, including those in industrial and electric vehicle (EV) applications, to realize superior battery performance with a significantly lower carbon footprint and reduced total cost of ownership.\nIontra: thinking outside the battery\nIontra's unique advanced battery sensing and charging method is predictive and\u00a0responsive, proactively protecting the battery while charging and discharging. Iontra eradicates the most concerning failure modes of batteries, plating and dendrite formation, which cause safety issues and limit battery performance.\nIontra is chemistry agnostic and proven to concurrently increase battery cycle life and charge speed by greater than 200 percent, support cold weather charging to -20\u00b0C, and create a safer charge overall, without changing the design of battery cells or packs.\n\"A more secure and sustainable energy future depends on the ability to maximize the use of the limited critical supply of battery minerals, materials, and other components, and Iontra helps to stretch those finite resources,\" said Jeff Granato, President and CEO, Iontra. \"Fulfilling our mission to remove the greatest hurdles facing this global energy transition, we are on the path to make Iontra's affordable charging solution available to the industry and are encouraged by the excitement and continued support of our customers and investors.\"\nSolving a global challenge\nGlobally, private industry and governments are investing billions of dollars to research new battery technologies in support of electrification and a lower carbon footprint, representing one of the greatest energy transition efforts in history. However, these investments struggle to meet the urgent need to address short and long-term supply chain issues associated with the dramatic increase in the demand for battery minerals and materials, nor do they address plating and dendrite formation, as Iontra does.\nExacerbating these challenges, current charge management solutions from companies such as Analog Devices, Qualcomm, and Texas Instruments are simply unable to deliver the kind of substantial performance improvements the market needs, and which Iontra's approach enables.\nValidation\nIontra's breakthrough charge control technology is validated by approximately three million cycling hours performed in-house, testing dozens of battery types and the stability of the system under various charge conditions for quality, reliability, and durability. Iontra's technology has also been tested by four independent research labs, including National Renewable Energy Laboratory, Novonix, UL Solutions, and University of Michigan.\n\"Incremental efficiency improvements will not address our climate and energy supply chain challenges, which is why Volta is again throwing its support behind Iontra's transformational battery charge control technology,\" said David Schroeder, CTO, Volta Energy Technologies. \"The way batteries are charged has largely been overlooked in the race to improve battery performance, but Iontra represents a radically new, and proven, approach that policy makers and product manufacturers should pay close attention to.\"\n\"The economic and environmental math is simple,\" said John Staudinger, Managing Director, Riverstone. \"By replacing the existing charge control chip in a product with Iontra's at the same or lesser cost, the increase in cycle life, charge speed, and other performance benefits are realized instantly.\u00a0Iontra not only improves your product but removes the need for vast amounts of new battery materials.\"\nAbout Iontra:\nIontra is a Colorado-based battery innovation company that dramatically improves the charge speed, cycle life, capacity utilization, cold weather charging, and safety of all lithium batteries. Iontra's breakthrough solution delivers the performance that next generation batteries are promising to deliver years from now. The company has its offices, R&D labs, and battery cycler fleets across multiple facilities in Colorado, Texas, and India.
