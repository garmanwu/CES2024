        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors.

PI has been continuously expanding its range of automated photonics alignment engines over the last decade and will introduce new systems at both ends of the spectrum at this year\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s event. A new, modular entry-level system based on mechanical stages, yet with a high-performance controller will be presented, as well as\u00c2\u00a0high-speed, air-bearing based systems for test and assembly applications\u00c2\u00a0requiring the highest throughput with zero wear and maintenance.\nThe global demand for SiPh components is currently growing dramatically, and leading market research companies unanimously predict a quadrupling of the SiPh component market to around $10 billion by 2030. Productivity, throughput, and manufacturing costs are therefore increasingly in focus. One of the major cost drivers is the precise alignment of optical fibers to the photonic elements of the chips. This task plays a crucial role both in production-related quality control and in coupling with optical fibers for assembly. Depending on the complexity of the end products, the alignment must be repeated up to two dozen times in the manufacturing process.\nThe time required for this is crucial for the throughput and cost of SiPh production and very second saved per alignment can be worth millions over a production run. With PI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proprietary algorithms and mechanics, alignment time can be reduced up to 99% compared to legacy approaches.\nIn addition to well-known solutions such as the F-712 alignment family, consisting of a hybrid combination of hexapods and piezo-based nanopositioners, the new air-bearing-based F-142/F-143 alignment systems and the F-836 entry-level system are now available.\nAdditional Solutions for Life-Sciences, Semiconductor Manufacturing, Laser Communication, and Laser Processing\nIn addition to photonics alignment engines, PI will also present wafer stages for the semiconductor industry, actuators for quantum computing optical paths, fast focusing stages for laser applications, nanopositioning and nanofocus devices for super-resolution microscopy, a new, piezo-based method of increasing throughput in laser micro-hole drilling and fast steering mirrors for free space optical laser communication on earth and on LEO satellites.\nPI's modular architecture supports the mixing of motion and drive types in one system, allowing each axis to be optimally equipped in terms of cost and performance. Control is carried out via expandable EtherCAT-based controllers from ACS, a company of the PI Group.\nCan't make it to San Francisco to experience our technology?\u00c2\u00a0You can look at a variety of\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\nUS Tech Online -> PI to Exhibit at BIOS/Photonics West\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n1,599 followers\nASMPT Presents Advanced Die Bonding System: MUNICH, GERMANY \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0With its new version of the AMICRA NOVA Pro, market leader ASMPT presents one of the most advanced die bonding systems.

Demand is growing particularly strongly in the silicon photonics sector. For example, you can produce active optical cables for 400/800 Gigabit/sec networks or co-packaged optics with the NOVA Pro.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nPowerful and adaptable\nThe NOVA Pro places dies in sizes ranging from 0.1 to 25 millimeters with a maximum accuracy of \u00c2\u00b11 micron @ 3\u00cf\u0192 at speeds of up to 1000 units per hour (UPH). At \u00c2\u00b13.0 microns @ 3\u00cf\u0192 it achieves even 3500 UPH. This impressive level of performance is also achieved in flip-chip mode.\nThe NOVA Pro ensures its trend-setting placement accuracy with its unique dynamic alignment method in combination with laser-based substrate heating technology. And thanks to its Active Bond Force Control, the machine can dose bonding forces with exceptional precision ranging from 10 g to 5000 g. Using an epoxy resin stamp with volumetric dosing, the dies can be affixed with adhesives that get UV-cured in place. The repertoire of precision die fastening methods includes in-situ bonding as well as eutectic die bonding with a bonding tool (up to 350 \u00c2\u00b0C), a ceramic pulse heater (up to 500 \u00c2\u00b0C), or a contactless laser (up to 450 \u00c2\u00b0C). An integrated post-bond inspection ensures maximum quality. With its very generous substrate area of 550 \u00c3\u2014 600 mm, the NOVA Pro is aimed at the die-bonding market in advanced packaging applications.\nReliable and versatile\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Anyone who opts for the NOVA Pro benefits from the many years of experience of the market leader, who is fully committed to the goal of zero DPMO,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd says Johann Weinhaendler. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The high reserves in terms of precision and performance as well as the flexible fixation and bonding options make this machine a future-proof investment.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n\u00c2\nTo learn more about ASMPT, visit\u00c2\u00a0www.asmpt.com.\u00c2\u00a0For more information about ASMPT Semiconductor Solutions, visit\u00c2\u00a0semi.asmpt.com.\nUS Tech Online -> ASMPT Presents Advanced Die Bonding System\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n1,599 followers\niNRCORE Adds BMS Transformers for EV Market: BRISTOL, PA \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2\u00a0iNRCORE, LLC, a premiere family of brands powering the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s net-generation systems with high-reliability magnetics and components, is pleased to announce the expansion of it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00c2\u00a0battery management system (BMS) transformer\u00c2\u00a0for electric vehicle (EV), data center, energy storage system, and smart grid industries.\nIn October of 2022, iNRCORE released the first BMS Transformer, RA1055NL, with AEC-Q200 qualification.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "Goodyear Unveils New Product, Partnerships at 2024 CES\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co. has announced plans for new collaborations and a new product at the 2024 Consumer Electronic Show (CES).\nNew products include the Goodyear ElectricDrive 2 tire.\nThe ElectricDrive 2 is an all-season electric vehicle (EV) tire with improved rolling resistance and SoundComfort Technology to reduce interior vehicle noise.\nThis tire will be available in the beginning of May 2024 in the United States and will come in 17 sizes designed to fit consumer EV sedans and CUVs \u2013 including the Tesla Models Y, 3 and S; the Ford Mustang Mach-E and more.\n\u201cWith the continued adoption of EVs, we want to meet consumer and market needs with an updated EV replacement tire,\u201d says David Reese, vice president, of product development, Goodyear Americas.\nFeatures of the tire include an aerodynamic sidewall that lowers aerodynamic drag; asymmetrical tread patterns for improved grip and responsiveness on wet and dry roads; SoundComfort Technology foam inserts to reduce vehicle noise; and more.\nCollaboration with ZF\nGoodyear also announced a collaboration with ZF, a global leader in vehicle systems and industrial technology, which has resulted in the integration of tire intelligence technologies with vehicle motion control software.\nThe collaboration delivers Goodyear SightLine, a suite of tire intelligence technologies, into the ZF cubiX ecosystem, a scalable vehicle motion control software that coordinates all dimensions of vehicle dynamics.\nThis provides further tire and road data into the chassis system and enables an improved driving experience with better comfort, control and efficiency, according to Goodyear officials.\n\u201cGoodyear SightLine will deepen our connection to the road and expand the scope and value of cubiX by supporting the era of software-defined vehicles,\u201d says Martin Fischer, member of the board of management responsible for the ZF Chassis Solution division.\n\u201cBy joining our ecosystems, our customers will unlock a range of possibilities to customize and optimize their solutions in both vehicle motion and tire intelligence.\u201d\nFurther advancements with Gatik\nGoodyear and Gatik, an autonomous middle mile B2B logistics fleet, announced a successful integration of tire intelligence technology into an autonomous driving system.\nGatik's autonomous fleet, consisting of Class 3 through Class 7 box trucks, is equipped with Goodyear\u2019s Endurance RSA tires with SightLine technology. This enables Gatik to \u201cadvance the safety and overall accuracy of its efficient fleet operations while improving delivery uptime,\u201d according to Goodyear officials.\nIn 2024, Gatik officials say they plan to implement the intelligent tire solutions into a \u201csignificant portion\u201d of its autonomous fleets across the United States and Canada.\n\"The groundbreaking integration of Goodyear SightLine technology into Gatik's autonomous fleet is a first in the industry,\u201d says Gautam Narang, co-founder and CEO of Gatik.\n\u201cThe real-time data derived from intelligent tire technology not only enhances the safety and predictability of our autonomous vehicles but also enables us to maintain high levels of efficiency, reliability and delivery uptime throughout our operations.\u201d\nABS safety with TNO\nTNO, the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research,\u00a0 and Goodyear showcased new possibilities for vehicle safety by integrating tire intelligence technology into the anti-lock brake system (ABS) controller of a test vehicle.\nAccording to Goodyear and TNO officials, through collaborative research and testing on a physical test vehicle, the companies effectively showcased that an improved ABS - equipped with information about the tire type and characteristics, such as wear - can potentially enhance overall system efficiency and reduce braking distance by as much as 5.75 feet.\n\u201cOur collaborative work with TNO has yielded invaluable insights, with exciting possibilities to deliver greater value to our customers and support the future of mobility,\u201d says Werner Happenhofer, vice president, of tire intelligence and eMobility solutions, Goodyear.\nTDK accelerates tire technology\nTDK Corp. and Goodyear also announced a collaboration to bring a robust tire sensing system to the market by combining TDK\u2019s software, sensor and electronic components with Goodyear\u2019s tire development, intelligent solutions and industry trends.\n\u201cThis alliance will have the joint benefit of accelerating both technology and customer access to the highest performance sensor technology in the market,\u201d says Jim Tran, general manager, of Americas HQ and deputy general manager, of technology and intellectual property center, TDK Corp.\nThe two companies are in the process of conducting market research and technical exploration for a joint solution that delivers actionable insights improving vehicle performance, safety and efficiency.\nBoth TDK and Goodyear will demonstrate their latest technologies and system solutions at CES. TDK\u2019s booth is in the central hall (LVCC) booth 20521, and Goodyear\u2019s booth is in the west hall (LVCC) Booth 4917.\nCES is taking place this week in Las Vegas, Nev.\nLatest in Suppliers\nGoodyear's Steve McClellan to Retire This Year\nMayhew Appoints New Director of Sales\nJohnDow Adds PurAbsorb to Dynamic Line\nTiremakers Bring Future Tech to CES"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

        "raw_content": "My 10 best moments at CES 2024 | The DeanBeat\nDo you want to get the latest gaming industry news straight to your inbox? Sign up for our daily and weekly newsletters here.\nCES is always full of interesting moments that kick off the year in technology, and CES 2024 was no different. I\u2019ve already talked about my favorite products of the big tech trade show in Las Vegas last week, and now here\u2019s a few moments that were interesting as well.\nOf course, the scale of the show is hard to fathom until you get there. Usually, there are perhaps 5,000 members of the press from around the world, and we started getting there on Sunday.\nI got into the line a bit late to see the CES trends session on January 7, hosted by Brian Comiskey and Jessica Boothe of the CTA\u2019s research division.\nHere\u2019s my 10 best moments at the show, from the start to the end. I would add my night at The Sphere, but I wrote about that already in my post on the best of CES. I spent tons of time at the Showstoppers and Pepcom Digital Experience parties.\nAnd I really enjoyed the keynote speeches from the non-big-tech companies like Walmart, Siemens, L\u2019Oreal and others this year. But this post focuses on some smaller-scale things that were wonderful ways to spend my week in Vegas.\nThe opening moments\nIt\u2019s always a bit of a shock to see how many press colleagues can fit into the same room. I squeezed in and listened to the predictions. But I marveled at the size of the crowd and took some selfies to show how packed like sardines we were, all hoping to be the ones to tell the best stories about CES. Sometimes it\u2019s not the products you see that are telling. It\u2019s more like what you go through to tell them. Like the line for really mediocre food for lunch.\nStill, I can be awestruck just like the greenest reporter in the midst of big crowds.\nThere are many who are skeptical there is anything valuable to be gleaned from CES in terms of unique insights. But I feel like the process of seeing a lot of things and narrowing them down to the most memorable is worth it. Of course, the older I get, the tougher the show becomes to attend. It\u2019s always a bit of a chore to move from the press events leading up to the Samsung event at the Mandalay Bay to the Sony press conference inside the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center. I managed to do so by skipping some press events, and I felt bad for not heading to the Venetian for the Intel event.\nStill, despite the hassles, I recognize that it\u2019s a privilege to be a part of the fourth estate and translate the tech to the masses who can never make it to the show in person. It\u2019s moments like the ones that follow that make me feel like going to CES in person is the best way to experience it.\nNetflix\u2019s The Three Body Problem\nI get to decide what to do with my time at CES, and one of my personal indulgences this year was to focus on some entertainment news. Netflix invited me to check out its mysterious booth where it was highlighting just one show, the upcoming series The Three Body Problem.\nBased on the novels by Cixin Liu, the science fiction books are one of the most amazing hard science trilogies I have ever read. I put it right up there with the world building of Frank Herbert\u2019s Dune and Andy Weir\u2019s The Martian and more.\nThe Three Body Problem chronicles Earth\u2019s contact with an alien civilization that comes from a solar system of a very different sort. In physics, the three body problem refers to the motion of three-point mass particles under their gravitational effects. It\u2019s like the gravitational pull of the sun, the Earth and the moon happening all at once.\nThe Three Body Problem is immensely hard to grasp, and yet it is rooted in science and physics in a way that most novels never bother to delve into the details. Back in 2020, Netflix announced that Game of Thrones streaming show writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss would adapt the trilogy into a sci-fi TV drama \u2014 making it the rare non-English book adapted by the streaming service.\nI waited in line just as the show floor opened and made my way to the booth, which had an odd logo on it symbolizing three bodies in motion. I waited with other media to get into the experience, which featured a silver VR headset. I watched a new teaser for the show and came out to see Benioff, Weiss and show producer Alexander Woo. I had a chance to ask them just one question. (There has been controversy around Liu\u2019s political comments, but I had no time to ask it).\nI had read the books \u2014 including the unofficial fourth book, The Redemption of Time, written by fan Baoshu. The book carried on the story in the same universe, and it was good enough to be blessed by Liu and published in English using the same translator, Ken Liu. Knowing that the ending of Game of Thrones was controversial in the final eighth season, I wanted to know what Benioff and Weiss felt about the ending presented by Liu, as well as the extension of the books by Baoshu.\nI asked them, \u201cCan you give me a clue how you feel about the ending of book three, and also whether you would think The Redemption of Time, book four, is really part of this story?\u201d\nBenioff told me he finished the third book on a flight from Tokyo. Weiss was on the same flight and he came over to his seat and said he had just finished reading it. Benioff replied that he had also just finished.\n\u201cI said, \u2018We have to do this,'\u201d Benioff said.\nBenioff added, \u201cTo me, these books are more ambitious than any novels I\u2019ve really ever read. The fact that Ci Liu was able to bring it all around in a really emotional way and kind of perfect \u2014 without spoiling it.\nFor people who have read it, that perfect final tempo was astounding and I hope that we get a chance to get to the end of the series so that we can end it in a brilliant way.\u201d\nAs for the fan fiction, Benioff said that was a separate issue.\n\u201cI think we\u2019re doing the adaptation to the trilogy shows it makes sense that maybe someone else will do that and we\u2019re concentrating on the three books,\u201d Benioff said.\nRiding the Vegas Loop underground between convention halls\nThe Vegas Loop at Las Vegas Convention Center can get you between the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center and the Central Hall in less than two minutes. Normally, it takes up to 25 minutes to do the walk.\nOperational since 2021, the system can transport more than 4,400 convention goers per hour. I used it a few times during CES, riding shotgun in a Tesla through a tunnel that is big enough for one lane. Elon Musk\u2019s Boring Company built it from 2019 to 2021, and now it\u2019s fully operational and it has opened a new loop to the Resorts World passenger station.\nAbout three or four people can ride at once now at around 35 miles per hour, with future vehicles able to hold up to 12 people. This is an example of something that works and works well.\nBack to Area15\nXR podcasters Charlie Fink and Ted Schilowitz threw a nice event at The Beast restaurant at Area15, the futuristic experiential event and entertainment district in a big warehouse located just off the Strip in Las Vegas.\nIt was fun to catch up with friends in the XR community like Angelo Del Priore at HP Tech Ventures and Anna Belova of Devar.\nArea15 offers themed entertainment experiences and ever-changing art and retail experiences for locals and visitors of all ages. The experiences include live events like concerts or raves, immersive activations, art installations, cool design elements, unique retail, fancy technology, bars and eateries, and more.\nI took a tour of it last year and it was amazing to see the strobe-light rooms, axe-throwing place, a free-roaming VR space, the VR bird flight sim, a simulated golf range and more. And it\u2019s next door to the Illuminarium, a cool cinematic immersive experience.\nAnd while doing the activity below, I learned that the roof of Area15 has a secret message on top of it. From above, you can see it says, \u201cDoes not exist.\u201d It is, after all, a twist on Nevada\u2019s famous Area 51 of UFO fame and secret Air Force programs like the U-2 spy plane.\nRiding the Goodyear Blimp\nSooner or later, even our tires on our cars had to get smart.\u00a0Goodyear\u00a0jumped into CES for the first time to say it has built tire intelligence into its tires with the help of tech-focused partners.\nTire intelligence means getting data on the actual state of wear of a tire and making predictions about how long that tire will last or how it will perform in emergency conditions.\nGoodyear has been around for 126 years, but it hasn\u2019t had a booth at CES until this year. I drove the company\u2019s simulators where it showed me the stopping distance that I would have if the car used knowledge of the state of the tires along with other information coming from the car\u2019s sensors.\nTo execute on this vision for safer tires and safer driving, Goodyear teamed up with partners TNO, ZF, TDK and Gatik.\nThe first time I went driving in the rain in the simulator, I found I couldn\u2019t stop fast enough at a stop sign and I ran right into a deer. Fortunately, that part wasn\u2019t animated. Later, I was able to stop well ahead of the stop sign.\nI was also able to do demos that showed the tire handling while driving between cones. And I was able to experience what hydroplaning was like \u2014 spinning out on a wet onramp \u2014 without fearing for my life.\nThe company started talking about Goodyear Sightline and tire intelligence back in 2020. Now the company has integrated it with the ZF technology to detect hydroplaning and do something about it.\nThrough rigorous collaborative research and testing on a test vehicle, Goodyear and TNO successfully exhibited that an improved ABS, empowered with tire-specific information like tire type and wear state, could potentially elevate system efficiency and curtail braking distance by 5.75 feet.\nGoodyear\u2019s new collaboration with TDK Corporation, an electronic components company, aims to accelerate adoption of integrated intelligent hardware and software into tires and vehicle ecosystems.\nWhat I enjoyed about the interview with Goodyear CTO Chris Helsel is that it reminded me about how tech is fading into the woodwork and becoming part of every product and company, even the ones that you think of as non-tech companies.\nMy favorite CES talk about tech from non-tech companies was a few years ago, when Arnold Donald \u2014 the CEO of the world\u2019s largest cruise company, Carnival Cruises \u2014\u00a0unveiled the Ocean Medallion wearable. That was interesting because it was an example of how technology was infiltrating a non-tech business, where the technology faded into the woodwork and the woodwork itself got smart. Carnival is now outfitting its 100-plus cruise ships with the technology.\nThis year, non-tech companies like Walmart and L\u2019Oreal gave keynote talks. Helsel said that Goodyear did not have a lot of software programmers or AI experts on hand when it started the journey. At its core, the company is a materials company, and it has a lot of those experts.\nHelsel joined the company 25 years ago to bring those tech skills into the company. The company partners to get some of that expertise, but it has also learned a lot itself and it has an office of 50 people in San Francisco, the heart of the tech industry.\n\u201cThe way I think about it, tech is everywhere,\u201d Helsel said.\nUp, up and away\nNow some of the tech ideas are getting to market in some upcoming tire models. The work isn\u2019t just in prototype form any more. And it\u2019s why Goodyear brought its world-famous Goodyear Blimp to the show. I was lucky enough to get a ride in it. The day before, all the flights were canceled because of wind.\nOur pilots\u2019 names were Joe and Taylor. They had a lot of experience flying the blimp and other aviation experience. This version of the blimp can carry six or eight people.\nThe blimps have been flying for nearly 100 years. They started out using hydrogen, but the Hindenburg disaster put an end to that. Now the blimps use helium.\nShe said there are probably less than 10 blimps in the world now. What was great about the experience was that it was like floating in a boat more than it was like flying a plane. You get to focus on the experience of flying and being a tourist from the air, rather than flying to some destination.\nThe blimp can fly 1,000 miles, but it takes maybe six or eight hours to do that. I spent the half hour or so in the blimp shooting pictures and videos out the window. I was deathly afraid I was going to drop my iPhone out the window while doing that. But fortunately it didn\u2019t happen.\nWalking into the Kohler booth\nEvery year, Kohler comes out with something special for CES. This year, it had smart bidets, targeted showerheads, and an infinity bathtub. I walked into the booth and it felt like I was going into a spa.\nI heard the rain of water coming from Kohler\u2019s shower heads and saw the Stillness Bath and the Sok drop-in infinity bathtub.\nThese might seem like luxuries for lazy people. But Kohler has a pitch like a soft warm shower. These are products for people with time challenges and they can give those people back time in their day for self-care. The booth was a nice respite from the rest of the show.\nIn general, this 150-year-old company is good at making itself stand out through designs where the tech is there but fades into the woodwork.\nI was surprised to see how much tech was in the SpaViva shower head. Offering a blend of unique spray technology and in-shower self-care, this handshower pairs Kohler\u2019s signature Katalyst spray with a Microbubble spray for a deeper clean. It includes a built-in cleansing device with a range of attachments for a multifunctional experience.\nThis donut-shaped nozzle has a heat-retaining spray that infuses air into water droplets and makes the water drops feel larger. A secondary spray is \u201cMicrobubbled\u201d to 100 microns or smaller and penetrates and flushes out the pores.\nSony Afeela electric car driven onstage with a game controller\nSony announced new details about the Sony Honda Mobility car, which will be called the Afeela electric sedan. It will use technology from Honda, Epic Games and Qualcomm. And it will give you access to play PlayStation games in the back seat.\nBut what I liked about the moment was that it came to the stage on style. Izumi Kawanishi, president and COO of Sony Honda Mobility, used a PS5 DualSense controller to drive the Afeela electric car on stage, making everyone laugh with the funny stunt.\nSony will open preorders for the car in the first half of 2025 and it will start deliveries in early 2026. The car looks beautiful and it will clearly have the Sony design touch.\nShift Robotics\u2019 Moonwalker X robotic shoes\nShift Robotics\u00a0unveiled Moonwalkers X as the latest version of its robotic shoes. The Austin, Texas-based company made the announcement ahead of\u00a0CES 2024. I tried them out at the Showstoppers party.\nThe Moonwalkers X is an enhanced iteration of the original Moonwalkers model, with improvements in weight, agility, and safety. The company aims to change the landscape of workplace mobility with these Robocop shoes.\nI tried was concerned I was going to wipe out and land flat on my back. But they were easy to walk with and I felt like I could have gone a lot faster. They were a lot easier to use than roller skates.\nThe execs said they\u2019re ideal for commercial applications where employees engage in extensive walking, such as distribution, logistics, and warehouse settings, involving as many as 30,000 steps per day. If you put this together with the exoskeletons that were at the show, it could make life easier for those workers.\nThe Brunswick self-docking boat demo\nBrunswick showed up with a cool demo of a self-docking boat. It didn\u2019t actually have a boat in a harbor at the Las Vegas Convention Center. But it did have a nice simulation of how it works. The company has outfitted its 40-feet Boston Whaler boat with the docking tech, sensors and cameras to enable it to dock itself, which is always one of the most challenging tasks for new boat owners.\nThe demo itself was cool as I could see the simulation running on a curved screen outside the boat platform. But when I stepped on the platform, I thought the boat itself was rocking. But that was an effect that was all in my head as the movement was actually on the screen, not on the floor of the booth.\nBrunswick CEO David Foulkes walked me around the booth and showed how the company was creating innovative boating gear like electric-powered outboard motors that could be used with bigger boats and get them to travel at speeds of 10 knots to 15 knots.\nHe said the company released its first three-knot and five-knot electric motors last year and is now adding them across the bigger boats and motors in its product line. Regulations in places like the Netherlands are forcing these changes for the sake of cleaner waters.\nHe also showed off the eFoil surfboard, which has a motor on it. It allows a surfer to glide above the water while the motor does its work underwater. And he noted the company has started its Freedom Boat Club, where it\u2019s like a timeshare for a boat except you don\u2019t own it. You pay a subscription fee annually and use a boat in a port city where one is available. Brunswick has 400 of these clubs around the world with around 5,000 boats available.\nPanel on AI and the democratization of game development\nAnd I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t mention the panel on \u201cAI and the democratization of game design\u201d that I moderated on Wednesday in the West Hall.\nOur panelists included Jani Penttinen, CEO, of Bitmagic; Latoya Peterson, CXO at Glow Up Games; Jonathan Stringfield, Vice President, Global Business Research and Marketing, Activision Blizzard; and Ike Nnoli, Senior PMM, Graphics & Simulation at Nvidia. It was a good session. We dwelled on what the impact would be on jobs, and Penttinen offered the reassuring notion that everything is changing fast and so there\u2019s no real way to fall behind if you haven\u2019t paid a lot of attention to it yet.\nI\u2019ll take that. But by no means is that a reason to ignore the impact of AI, which will be felt both in the ranks of professional game development as well as among the creators of user-generated content.\nGamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is \"where passion meets business.\" What does this mean?
