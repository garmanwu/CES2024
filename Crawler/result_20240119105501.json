        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view.

Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium.

The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024.

In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. It has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode, so you can have different settings for different walls in your home. So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action. The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe 5 best monitors at CES 2024\nThe most exciting displays at the show feature some truly incredible screen specs\nIf you\u2019re a big ol\u2019 display dweeb like myself, CES 2024 is basically Christmas\u2026 just replace the big-boned, beardy dude trespassing on your premises with the best monitors and best TVs being debuted in Las Vegas in front of hordes of excited tech press.\nThe annual Sin City-based mega event has produced some particularly exciting monitors this year, a number of which boast truly ludicrous refresh rates that should have hardcore first-person shooter fans drooling. What\u2019s also becoming increasingly clear is the PC market\u2019s continued love affair with OLED technology is getting more intimate with every passing year.\nWith so many impressive new models being produced from a variety of manufacturers, the days of the traditional IPS panel look increasingly numbered if you demand impeccable black levels from your monitor.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nThe best monitors of CES 2024 so far\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a new monitor, you may want to hold out for another few months until the tantalizing displays below have been released. Some of them look simply sensational. Here are some of the best monitors we\u2019ve seen from CES so far. Buckle up screen nerds: your peepers are in for quite the ride.\n1. Acer Predator Z57\nEven as someone who owns a 49-inch gaming monitor, this thing is just silly. Yet silly in the best possible way. The Acer Predator Z57 is a colossal 57-inch, 120Hz ultrawide gaming monitor that essentially has the same screen real estate of a couple of 4K displays. It\u2019s resolution? A frankly absurd 7,680 x 2,160. Let that number sink in for a second.\nThe Z57 further impresses with 1000R curvature, which should make for quite the wraparound viewing experience in some of the best PC games. Throw in the fact it\u2019s capable of hitting 1000 nits of brightness in HDR mode and hits 98% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and this titan should produce beautifully accurate, utterly vibrant pictures. Just make sure you go out and purchase a desk the size of a park bench if you\u2019re planning on buying this beast.\n2. Asus ROG Swift PG27 (2024)\nThe Asus ROG Swift PG27 has always been an excellent monitor series, but this year the company is really taking things to the next level with more than a little help from Nvidia. Alongside a number of other monitors from Dell and Philips, the latest PG27 boasts the latest evolution of Team Green's G-Sync technology.\nCalled G-Sync Pulsar, Nvidia describes it as \u201cthe next evolution of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) technology\u201d. Said fps-smoothing tech promises to deliver not only the usual stutter-free gaming experiences you\u2019d expect from the best G-Sync monitors, but the company claims it will set \u201ca new gold standard for visual clarity and fidelity through the invention of variable frequency strobing\u201d. Nvidia promises the latest ROG Swift PG27 will boast effective motion clarity to over 1000Hz. So if you\u2019re looking for a gaming monitor capable of producing potentially the smoothest gameplay experiences we\u2019ve ever seen, this currently looks like the model to beat.\n3. Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 (2024)\nBoy, does my timing ever suck when it comes to buying new monitors. I caved and picked up the awesome Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 in an admittedly delicious Black Friday deal late last year, but now I have serious display envy thanks to the announcement of the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8. Last year\u2019s model was already a terrific gaming monitor with a screen resolution of 3,440 x 1,440 and a gorgeous OLED panel that sported a 175Hz refresh rate.\nSamsungs\u2019 latest model (full title the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 G80SD), is a different beast entirely. For one thing, this 32-inch OLED gaming monitor ditches the previous G8\u2019s ultrawide aspect ratio in favor of a more traditional 16:9 form factor. That\u2019s instantly going to make it more accessible to those with limited desk space.\nThe most exciting stat is that the new G8 rocks an astoundingly speedy 240Hz refresh rate. Pair that with its 4K display (3,840 x 2,160) and response times of just 0.03ms, and this should be one hell of a gaming screen if you\u2019ve got a powerful enough GPU/CPU combo to squeeze the most out of its stunning specs.\n4. Alienware AW3225QF\nDespite the fact the amazing Alienware AW3423DWF is currently boxed up in my bedroom ready to be sold on eBay \u2014 mainly because I bought that Samsung G9 I mentioned above \u2014 I really do love Alienware monitors. I\u2019ve owned several down the years, and from a specs perspective, the Alienware AW3225QF looks to be the most impressive gaming monitor Dell has manufactured to date.\nThe headline, oh so exciting facts for display nerds? This is a 32-inch, 4K OLED monitor that has a refresh rate of 240Hz. Predictably being OLED, response times are currently quoted at just 0.03ms. Color accuracy should also be excellent, with the AW3225QF covering 99% of the DCI-P3 gamut. This panel's PPI (pixels per inch) is also higher than any existing OLED gaming monitor at 140 PPI \u2014 most existing OLED monitors max out at just over 100 PPI. My only slight concern with this is could be overly pronounced pixel density on a 32-inch screen.\nBut hey, that\u2019s ultra nerdy nitpicking on my part. This baby looks like the real deal, and we could easily see it sitting atop our picks of the best gaming monitors later in the year. It launches later this month for what I'd argue is a pretty reasonable $1,199.\n5. LG\u2019s new 480Hz monitor\nIf you\u2019re in full \u201cMaverick Mode\u201d and are craving the need for ALL the speed, LG\u2019s currently unnamed new 27-inch OLED display could be the gaming monitors of your dreams. While it may not have an official moniker yet, we know that this 1440p (or QHD) display features a refresh rate of \u2014 wait for it \u2014 480Hz. If you\u2019re an aspiring future eSports champ, you may have just found the monitor to power your aspiring competitive gaming fantasies.\nThis new LG monitor\u2019s screen credentials are further boosted by LG Display's \u201cMETA technology\u201d, last seen in the sensational LG G3 OLED TV. Essentially, it\u2019s a type of software solution that in the case of the G3, combined with that television\u2019s Micro Lens Array panel to create one of the brightest and best OLED TVs we\u2019ve ever reviewed. When this monitor finally gets a name, expect its HDR performance to be almost impressive as that head-spinning refresh rate.\nCheck out our CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nCES 2024: The Best in Travel Tech, From Personal Planes and a will.i.am.-Designed Mercedes-Benz Sound System to an AI-Enabled E-Bike\nApple Vision Pro Is Available for Pre-Order: Here's When You Can Get the New VR Headset Online\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office.

Please try a different type of web browser.\n[CES 2024] Go Beyond Viewing: Samsung Pushes the Boundaries of Home Entertainment at the Screen Experience Zone\nSamsung Electronics unveiled its vision for the future of displays and screens at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 in Las Vegas from January 9-12.\nWith more consumers desiring quality appliances to enjoy various forms of entertainment, Samsung has consistently sought to raise the bar for viewing experiences through its innovations. In line with this, the company showcased some of its premium appliances and newest services at the Screen Experience Zone in its CES booth. From the Neo QLED 8K ultra-large, high-definition TVs to Ballie smart home companion, the Screen Experience Zone was a must-see section for attendees.\nSamsung Newsroom visited the site to capture the excitement surrounding the company\u2019s latest visual display technologies.\n\u25b2 CES 2024 attendees enjoyed a fantastic showcase of Samsung\u2019s leading display technologies in the Screen Experience Zone.\nUnparalleled Viewing Experiences on an AI-Powered 8K Display\nAs a TV market leader for nearly two decades, Samsung\u2019s premium displays have continually set the standard for viewing experiences. Building off this expertise, Samsung integrated AI technology into its TVs to create the 2024 Neo QLED 8K \u2014 offering users superior viewing experiences with the latest technical features.\n\u25b2 Attendees viewed the Neo QLED 8K display section at the Samsung First Look event on January 7 (local time).\nThe Neo QLED 8K contains the NQ8 AI Gen3 Processor,\u00ad the company\u2019s most advanced AI-powered processor to date. The processor supports a neural processing unit (NPU) that is twice as fast as previous versions and an AI neural network eight times larger than before. As the processor utilizes deep learning and 8K AI Upscaling Pro technology, it automatically adjusts image and sound quality, delivering picture-perfect 8K content every time.\n\u25b2 Attendees tested out the AI Motion Enhancer Pro and Active Voice Amplifier Pro functions of the Neo QLED 8K display, optimizing content for at-home viewing.\nVisitors to the zone could also learn about the new AI Motion Enhancer Pro and Active Voice Amplifier Pro functionality of the Neo QLED 8K which help to minimize distractions while viewing. The AI Motion Enhancer Pro utilizes a sophisticated motion detection algorithm to enhance clarity during motion-intense content, such as sports games, helping users enjoy every moment of a match. Similarly, the Active Voice Amplifier Pro feature utilizes AI to analyze and separate aspects of sound to provide optimal sound for different types of content. For instance, users can choose to minimize or enhance the background noise from a conversation \u2014 helping them catch every word without distractions.\n\u25b2 Enhanced by Samsung\u2019s Tizen OS, the Neo QLED 8K display offers expanded connectivity between the display and a multitude of Samsung devices.\nTo provide opportunity for further customization, the 2024 Neo QLED 8K comes equipped with Samsung\u2019s open-source operating system Tizen. As part of this, Daily+ enables users to adjust their content viewing experience by connecting their Samsung devices, such as Galaxy smartwatches, Galaxy Buds, Galaxy smartphones and more, to their display. As such, users can view exercise data from their Galaxy Watch while working out and mirror video calls from their smartphone conveniently on their TV.\n\u25b2 For a seamless appearance in any interior, the Infinity Air Stand features a minimalistic design that blends into the space.\nSamsung also displayed its Infinity Air Design of the 2024 Neo QLED 8K that boasts a slim profile. Mounted on the Infinity Air Stand, the display appeared to be floating above ground. With this seamless and simple design, viewers can stay focused on the content without being distracted by clunky stands or display setups.\nA High-Definition MICRO LED Display Built for Every Consumer\nAside from the Neo QLED 8K display, Samsung showcased its line of MICRO LED displays, including the ultra-customizable, modular Transparent MICRO LED.\n\u25b2 The new 140-inch MICRO LED screen captivated viewers with its crystal-clear picture quality and high resolution.\nUpon entering the space, visitors can experience the overwhelming sense of realism created by the 140-inch ultra-large MICRO LED display. Since the screen is bezel-less and modular, the size, resolution and ratio can be freely scaled and adjusted according to user preferences. Additionally, the new line of 2024 MICRO LED displays come in a new 140-inch size option, giving consumers another option in line with the trend of large screens.\n\u25b2 Samsung provided attendees with an in-depth look at the meticulous development process for the MICRO LED technology.\nTo give visitors a glimpse of the artistry and ingenuity behind MICRO LED technology, the Screen Experience Zone displayed the MICRO LED Craftsmanship Wall \u2014 representing the countless hours of work needed to develop the screen.\n\u25b2 Attendees learned about the groundbreaking technology used in the Transparent MICRO LED, a display characterized by its eye-catching, glass-like appearance.\n\u25b2 Spanning across the back wall of the zone, the Transparent MICRO LED was the main highlight for many guests at the event.\nAdditionally, Samsung showed off its Transparent MICRO LED screens, which feature a strikingly clear design that mirrors that of glass.\nExpanding Home Possibilities With IoT Tech\nA curious object that caught the attention of many attendees was Ballie, Samsung\u2019s smart home companion that wandered around a corner of the booth freely. First introduced at CES 2020, Ballie\u2019s functionality has been upgraded to better meet users\u2019 needs. As it can autonomously navigate users\u2019 homes, Ballie acts as a smart personal assistant, monitoring the home and performing a multitude of tasks efficiently.\n\u25b2 Attendees eagerly watched the demonstration of the upgraded Ballie, which acts as a personal companion at home.\nWith its upgraded functionality, Ballie can interact with and control IoT home devices to create the perfect home environment. To help users start their day, Ballie can open the curtains according to a user\u2019s preferred wake-up time. When preparing for the day ahead, Ballie can project a variety of content \u2014 such as daily news or weather conditions \u2014 on the floor or wall. Additionally, Ballie can monitor pets and family members when a user is away from home, automatically alerting them in the event of an emergency.\n\u25b2 Ballie can autonomously navigate around the house and perform a variety of useful tasks, helping make users\u2019 lives more convenient.\nAdditionally, using the new Now+ SmartThings Hub function, users can monitor their home on their TV even when they\u2019re not viewing content. If movement is detected, the Now+ Widget automatically appears on the screen, providing summaries on home energy usage, weather conditions, home information and more. When watching content, users can easily toggle the setting off from the quick menu to not be disturbed.\n\u25b2 The SmartThings Hub provides users with a variety of information regarding their home, daily schedule and more.\nImmersion Taken to the Next Level\nSamsung displayed a plethora of its other innovative technologies that redefine home entertainment experiences at the Samsung First Look event. This included The Premiere 8K, the world\u2019s first wireless 8K projector that extends up to 150 inches, and the Music Frame, a smart frame-shaped speaker that fits any interior. Attendees also viewed how Samsung is driving innovation within the gaming realm with the Gaming Hub and the line of products created with Performance Designed Products (PDP), helping users enjoy games more and taking gaming experiences to the next level.\n\u25b2 The Premiere 8K (on left) and Music Frame were unveiled at the Samsung First Look event before the start of CES.\nDisplaying its industry-leading expertise through a multitude of products, Samsung ushered in a new era of viewing experiences built on the latest technologies.

The amount that you can save with solar in Ashburn, VA is based on two factors: how much you spend on electricity now and how much of your electric bill you can offset with solar.\nBased on the intensity and amount of sunlight hours in Ashburn, VA, the average electricity customer in Ashburn, VA will need a 11.1 kilowatt (kW) solar panel system to offset 100% of their annual electricity consumption of 15,360 kWh per year. On the EnergySage Marketplace, solar shoppers in Ashburn, VA pay an average of $33,000 for a 11.1 kW solar panel system prior to\nincentives.\nThe savings from offsetting 100% of an electric bill with solar can add up fast!\nAssuming an 2.0% annual increase in electricity prices and that you install your system with a $0-down loan,\nyou can expect to save $2,100 in your first year,\n$10,800 over five years, $22,800 over 10 years,\nand $50,500 over 20 years on electric bills in Ashburn, VA.\nOver your system\u2019s lifetime you\u2019ll save more by financing your solar system with a cash purchase,\nbut you won\u2019t start saving in year one. Learn more about how to finance your solar panel system.\nHow much can you save by going solar in Ashburn, VA?\nElectric bills in Ashburn, VA\nMonthly electric bills are a product of how much electricity you use per month and your electric rate. In Ashburn, VA, the average monthly electric bill for residential customers is $173/month, which is calculated by multiplying the average monthly consumption by the average electric rate: 1,280 kWh * 14 \u00a2/kWh.\nElectric bills are designed to cover all of the costs of producing the electricity that you use, of running and maintaining the electrical grid to help prevent outages, and of any public benefit funds that promote things like renewable energy and energy efficiency. These costs are rolled into both fixed charges (i.e., monthly customer charges) and variable charges (i.e., \u00a2/kWh that you use). While fixed charges will remain the same from month to month, the portion of variable charges on your bill each month will change based on how much electricity you use. As a result, there are two ways to reduce your bills: by either\nusing less electricity\nor by reducing the cost of electricity, by installing solar for instance.\nElectric rates in Ashburn, VA\nThe easiest way to compare the cost of electricity from one region to another is to look at the electricity rate. Residential rates in the U.S. range from 6 \u00a2/kWh to 71 \u00a2/kWh depending upon where you live, what types of power plants provide your electricity, and when during the day or year you\u2019re consuming electricity.\nThe average residential electricity rate in Ashburn, VA is 14 \u00a2/kWh, which is 3% lower than the average electricity rate in Virginia of 13.90 \u00a2/kWh. The average residential electricity rate in Ashburn, VA is 28% lower than the national average rate of 19 \u00a2/kWh.\nHow solar helps you save on electric bills\nSolar panel systems help you save money by reducing your monthly electric bills. Although a $50 or $100 electric bill might not seem like much when you pay it each month, those bills add up quickly over ten, twenty or even thirty years: if you pay $100 per month in electricity now, you\u2019ll pay over $49,000 on electricity over the next thirty years!\nAssuming a 2.0% annual increase based on inflation and average annual electric rate increases.\nInstalling solar allows you to reduce or even eliminate your electric bill: when you pay upfront for solar panels, you are effectively paying today for the electricity you\u2019ll use over the next 25 or even 30 years.\nCalculating your savings from investing in solar\nis as simple as subtracting the amount you pay for solar from what you would have paid for electricity otherwise.\nEnergySage can help you go solar and save!\nWe know electric bills add up over time, and going solar is a great way to save money while helping the environment.

        "raw_content": "QTS Builds for a Future Filled With Faster, Larger Hyperscale Projects\nASHBURN \u2013 As you drive up the ramp from the Dulles Greenway onto Loudoun County Parkway, there\u2019s a new presence that fills your field of vision. It\u2019s the red-and-white facade of a QTS data center, positioned at the gateway to Northern Virginia\u2019s Data Center Alley.\nFor QTS Data Centers, the visual prominence of the Shellhorn-DC1 building tracks with the company\u2019s emergence as a leading player in hyperscale infrastructure. The QTS growth story has been powered by two prevailing trends: the growth of hyperscale computing and the consolidation in the data center sector.\nIt\u2019s been just four years since QTS overhauled its business to focus on the hyperscale market, shedding a managed services business and in-house cloud offering. Backed by the financial strength of Blackstone, which acquired QTS last year for $10 billion, the company is now competing for \u2013 and winning \u2013 some of the largest hyperscale deals.\nAs a private company, QTS no longer issues public updates on its performance. But third-party reporting has highlighted the company\u2019s success in Hillsboro, Oregon, where it is supporting a large new data center campus for Meta. A regulatory filing reveals that QTS and utility PGE are seeking 250 megawatts (MW) of renewable energy capacity to support the multi-building Meta project.\nWhile the precise details of the Meta deal are not public, it is without a doubt one of history\u2019s largest wholesale data center deals.\nQTS has also seen leasing success in Ashburn, where demand from large customers has helped populate the 42-megawatt Shellhorn-DC1 data center, and prompted the construction of an identical facility next to it.\nThe project displays the company\u2019s ability to deliver capacity quickly, as QTS was able to transform the site from dirt to a fully-commissioned data center in seven months during one of the toughest periods of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSpeed Matters for Hyperscale Builds\nThe 310,000 square foot Shellhorn DC-1 was cited as Data Center Construction Project of the Year in the Northern Virginia Technology Council\u2019s 2021 Data Center Awards.\n\u201cQTS has rapidly established itself as a leader in the Ashburn data center development community,\u201d said Buddy Rizer, Executive Director, Loudoun County Department of Economic Development. \u201cWe welcome its economic contributions and appreciate the partnership with county staff that allowed them to create the new state-of-the-art Ashburn-Shellhorn data center that is the fastest ever data center built in Northern Virginia.\u201d\nPower and cooling equipment in a gallery running alongside a data hall in the QTS Shellhorn DC-1 data center. (Photo: Rich Miller)\nThere have been other projects in the region that have been deployed quickly \u2013 notably the CyrusOne Sterling II project, which was built in 6 months in 2016 \u2013 but few have faced the challenges confronted by QTS in 2020. The Shellhorn project was part of a building boom in Loudoun County as hyperscale providers raced to provision capacity to meet intense demand for cloud services as COVID-19 precautions shifted school, work and entertainment to an online delivery model.\nThe Shellhorn project is one of the first data centers delivered using the QTS Freedom Building Design, which was created to combine a standard design with smart logistics. QTS says the design helps it deliver data centers faster, while remaining flexible enough to adapt to the requirements of hyperscale and cloud operators, who now account for more than 50% of the company\u2019s business.\nThe QTS Journey: Retrofits to Hyperscale\nQTS was founded in 2005 by Chad Williams as Quality Technology Services, operating a single data center in Kansas. Williams continues to serve as Chairman and Chief Executive Office of QTS, but the company now operates more than 7 million square feet of data centers in in 20 markets across North America and Europe, including large data center campuses in Northern Virginia, Chicago, Dallas, Atlanta and Oregon.\nIn its early years, the company was known for retrofits of mega-scale industrial facilities to create large data centers. In 2018 QTS shifted its development focus to the largest customers in the hyperscale market, a move that coincided with the opening of the company\u2019s first facility in Ashburn, the leading market for cloud infrastructure.\nThat strategy was gaining momentum at the onset of the pandemic, which prompted more customers to embrace the remote management tools in the QTS Service Delivery Platform (SDP), which provides customers easy access to more cameras, sensors and KVM (keyboard, video, mouse) management tools. This allowed QTS to offer customers options while restricting their access to facilities.\nThe success of SDP is among the factors that impressed Blackstone, the world\u2019s largest alternative asset manager, as it sought to invest in digital infrastructure. .\n\u201cQTS aligns with one of Blackstone\u2019s highest conviction themes \u2013 data proliferation \u2013 and the required investment makes it well suited as a long-term holding for our perpetual capital vehicles,\u201d said Greg Blank and Tyler Henritze, Senior Managing Directors at Blackstone.\nWhy The Freedom Design Matters\nQTS broke ground on the Shellhorn project on June 1, 2020, and completed the space with fully-commissioned power in place on Dec. 31. The company says the shift to the Freedom Design was key in accelerating its delivery. The design was a response to the speed of hyperscale expansions, and brought together the design and logistics teams to streamline their processes and timelines.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a flexible setup that works with interchangeable vendors,\u201d said\u00a0James RePass, the Vice President of Facilities Operations at QTS. \u201cIt allows us to drive to a custom solution within a standard product.\u201d\nThe design employs an N+1 approach to power infrastructure, featuring power pods that include a 1.5-megawatt UPS and switchgear, backed by a 2.25-megawatt generator. Standardizing the design enabled QTS to build its UPS rooms offsite in a factory in Louisiana, where the production line can operate continuously and direct finished pods to each new project as needed.\nThe equipment yard of QTS Shellhorn DC-1, filled with power pod infrastructure, with a view of the frame for the next 42-megawatt data center planned for the campus. (Photo: Rich Miller)\nThirty two of these pods are deployed along the length of the Shellhorn facility, supporting a flexible design for the 170,000 square feet of data halls inside the building, which can be configured to be as large as 10.5 megawatts.\n\u201cYou can right-size deployments from the start,\u201d said RePass. \u201cThe underlying base design allows almost anything the customer wants to do, even with high-density air cooling.\u201d\nThe Road Ahead: Competing at Scale\nThe Freedom design is also being used in Hillsboro to deliver the massive campus for Meta. It\u2019s one of the first major deals since the completion of the Blackstone acquisition in August 2021, which set off a ripple effect of data center M&A, and may serve as a prototype for how investors can accelerate the growth of privately-held data center developers.\nBlackstone is among the large investors focused on the data center industry and the growth of the digital economy. With more than $684 billion in assets under management, Blackstone provides QTS with extraordinary resources to fund data center construction and management technology, a network of potential partners and customers across Blackstone\u2019s investment universe.\nThe placement of QTS within Blackstone\u2019s perpetual funds is strategically important, as these funds focus on long-term holdings, unlike targeted funds that typically seek returns within a specific timeframe. That matters in cloud computing, where tenants want development runway for long-term growth. Blackstone\u2019s backing means QTS can pursue the land and construction financing to make that happen.\nBlackstone\u2019s backing means QTS can pursue the land and construction financing to create long-term runways for data center growth.\nNorthern Virginia is an example. QTS has room to grow on its campuses in Ashburn and Manassas, but is also looking to secure up to 800 acres of land in Prince William County as part of the Digital Gateway project, which would create a massive data center district near one of the area\u2019s Civil War battlefields. QTS has not publicly discussed the details of its proposal, but says it will pursue \u201ca thoughtful development strategy that will preserve the historical significance and aesthetic beauty of the area.\u201d\nQTS is also building a connectivity strategy to enable a shift away from traditional data hubs in major markets, as cloud players seek favorable economics and room for long-term growth for network infrastructure. Amazon Web Services recently deployed components of its network infrastructure in QTS data centers in Chicago, Atlanta, and Piscataway, N.J.\nThe AWS regional deployments align with the QTS\u2019 ambitions to decentralize network architecture, moving beyond the traditional interconnection model. in which network hubs in the central business district large of major cities are the center of gravity for interconnection.\nSean Baillie, Executive Vice President, Connectivity at QTS, says that growing clouds need more equipment space than is easily available in carrier hotels, which are often downtown towers with limited floor plates.\n\u201cI think that this is a validator that we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d said Baillie. \u201cThis is going to change the nature of big network exchanges in major US markets.\u201d\nThe markets for hyperscale computing and interconnection services remain intensely competitive. With an experienced team, streamlined design and strong financial backing, QTS has navigated the fast-moving trends shaping digital infrastructure, positioning itself to be a bigger builder of the clouds to come.\nRich Miller\nContinue Reading\nThe Eight Themes That Will Shape the Data Center Industry in 2024\nQTS Data Centers Makes $1 Billion South Carolina Debut Amid Busy 2023\nSponsored Recommendations\nThe NFPA 70B Standard Just Got an Overhaul.
