(Tokyo, Japan) has decided to establish a new company in Texas through Dongwoo Fine-Chem Co., Ltd., a wholly-owned subsidiary located in South Korea, and to build at the company a high-purity semiconductor process chemical manufacturing plant. The new company, Sumika Semiconductor Materials Texas Inc., will serve as a strategic base in the U.S. market for the Sumitomo Chemical Group\u2019s semiconductor process chemicals business and work to expand this business in the U.S. by effectively capturing robust demand. The new plant is due to commence operations in fiscal 2024.\nSumitomo Chemical started production of high-purity chemicals used for precision cleaning in the semiconductor manufacturing process in 1978 at its Chiba Works in Japan, and since then has built its supply systems in Asian countries to meet customer demand. The Company has been highly rated by semiconductor manufacturers in and outside Japan for the technological strengths it has demonstrated by leveraging its ultra-high purification technology that reduces impurities down to a parts-per-trillion level and its quality assurance system based on micro-impurity analysis technology, as well as for its agility in increasing supply capacity in response to market demand.\nGrowth in demand for semiconductors is expected to continue, driven by market uptake of 5G-compatible devices and progress in the development of advanced technologies, such as AI and autonomous driving. Against this backdrop, governments of various countries have launched industrial policies to enhance semiconductor production capacity, and in the U.S., major semiconductor manufacturers have, one after another, announced plans to build new semiconductor plants. To effectively capture this strong U.S. demand for semiconductor materials, Sumitomo Chemical has decided to construct the new high-purity semiconductor process chemical plant. The Company has a subsidiary in Arizona, the U.S., Sumitomo Chemical Advanced Technologies LLC, through which it operates a compound semiconductor materials business. With this new plant coming into operation, the Sumitomo Chemical Group will have its bases in both Texas and Arizona, the two states where the U.S. semiconductor industry is concentrated, and will further accelerate the development of its semiconductor materials business in the U.S.\nSumitomo Chemical has identified contribution to ICT innovation as one of the material issues to be addressed as management priorities. The Company will strive to contribute to the growth of the semiconductor industry, which is indispensable for achieving a smart society and smart mobility, by expanding its global production capacity for semiconductor process chemicals and providing a stable supply of high-quality products.\nRelated Content\nCurrent Issue\nJoin today to get all of CHEMICAL ENGINEERING\nTest Your Knowledge\nJob Listings\nChemical Engineering news and content delivered every week\n\u00a9 Access Intelligence, LLC.\nAll rights reserved. | Privacy Policy\n| Diversity, Equity, Inclusion & Belonging\n| Accessibility Statement"

The company plans to demo this innovation this summer, during Mobile World Congress (MWC) 2021.\nCurrent 5G smartphones have mmWave antennas built into the side or the back of the device, which often causes interruptions to radio wave transmission and disruptions to 5G stability\u00a0when users hold the smartphone with their hands. This makes Dongwoo Fine-Chem's AoD\u00a0innovation unique,\u00a0because\u00a0it can be fitted on all smartphone screens, reducing disruptions.\n\"Technologies like augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) require mmWave 5G technology that delivers high speed and low latency, but today's version of this perfect 5G experience often falls short due to the limitations of mmWave 5G,\" said Rha In-ho, CEO and president of Dongwoo Fine-Chem.\"\u00a0We are pleased to unveil our AoD technology, and we look forward to collaborating with smartphone and chip manufacturers to achieve 5G innovation together.\"\nMillimeter wave (mmWave) is a radio wave of 30-300GHz in frequency and 1-10mm in wavelength, perfected to achieve super high-speed 5G, while securing a wide bandwidth at the same time. However, mmWave cannot pass most solid materials effectively. Dongwoo Fine-Chem's AoD technology allows device manufacturers to install a transparent antenna on the display, which typically has the lowest possibility of users covering it with their hands, minimizing transmission interruptions and achieving stable mmWave 5G communication. It can realize dual polarization on the three frequencies (n257=26.5~29.5GHz, n258=24.25~27.5GHz, n260=37~40GHz) of mmWave 5G that is most commonly used worldwide.\nAoD technology can be utilized in various ways with ease, making it highly applicable. By applying the technology to facilities such as glass windows on vehicles and buildings, signages, or streetlamps, and giving them antenna function, it becomes easier to expand 5G infrastructure without any changes to the exterior.\nDongwoo Fine-Chem is building a robust and comprehensive global patent portfolio ranging from core technologies in integrating transparent antennas with displays including OLED to antenna module composition. The company currently has or has filed about 240 patents around the world, including the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) as well as the U.S., China, and Japan.\nDongwoo Fine-Chem will be attending MWC 2021 online. AoD technology will be available at the MWC online exhibit (www.mwcbarcelona.com/exhibitors/dongwoo-fine-chem).\nAbout DONGWOO FINE-CHEM\nDongwoo Fine-Chem is the largest company in the world in the field of touch sensors for OLED displays. As a subsidiary of Japan's Sumitomo Chemical, it was established in Korea in 1991. The company has manufactured high-purity chemicals, high-purity alumina, touch sensors, polarizing film, and color filters for semiconductors and LCD, OLED displays. In collaboration with local universities and companies, Dongwoo Fine-Chem has secured original and exclusive antenna design technologies, with the world's only design and manufacturing technology in transparent antenna that can be integrated with displays.\nDongwoo Fine-Chem recorded about USD 2.7 billion (KRW 3 trillion) in sales in 2020 FY (April 2020 to March 2021).\nFor more information, please visit our website at www.dwchem.co.kr.\nSOURCE Dongwoo Fine-Chem\nhttp://www.dwchem.co.kr/\nModal title\nSign up for Top Stories & curated News delivered to your inbox\nThank you for subscribing!\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout\nMy Services\nContact PR Newswire\nProducts\nAbout"

There may be others that we are not aware of and are hence not named here.\nThese companies provide legitimate exhibition guides aimed at exhibitors across the globe offering online listing services. They use a form which resembles and organizer's free catalogue listing service, inviting exhibitors to complete the form for an entry in an on-line directory. Unsuspecting exhibitors who sign and return the form are then contracted into a three-year, non-retractable agreement, which could cost the exhibitor a significant amount of money, with very limited foreseeable benefits. The details are often available on the form itself, but are often too small and insignificant to be noticed. It is always wise to really the small print before signing a contract, and if the information is impossible to read then the contract should not be signed.\u00a0These publications have no connection with SEMI or any of our events, and it is important that all companies are made aware of this.\nShould you receive any communication from the Expo-Guide and Fairguide.com or related company, please IGNORE THEM COMPLETELY and DO NOT COMMUNICATE WITH THEM IN ANY WAY.\nFor Technical Support with this webpage, please contact support.\nATTEND\nPrograms\nExhibit\nNews\nContact Us\nSeoul\nKorea World Trade Tower\n#4205, 511, Youngdongdae-ro\nGangnam-gu\nSeoul, 06164 Korea\nTel: 82.2.531.7800\nFax: 82.2.551.3406\nEmail: semiconkorea@semi.org\nCopyright 2018, a2z, Inc.

Telos has occupied the site since at least 2014 and is reportedly leased until 2029.\nWhether Finmarc aims to demolish the existing buildings and construct new facilities or retrofit the existing buildings is unclear.\nBJ reports, however, that Finmarc isn\u2019t looking to develop the data center until 2026. This may be due to the energy capacity crunch the Ashburn area is suffering which is limiting new data center developments. The crunch is set to end around 2026 with the installation of new power lines.\nBJ also notes the early filing may help the company avoid future restrictions around building data centers along Route 7. Finmarc declined to comment to the publication.\n\u201cI do not want a data center along Route 7 at that location,\u201d Supervisor Mike Turner, D-Ashburn, and chair of the county\u2019s Transportation and Land Use Committee, told BJ.\nHowever, he noted the county doesn\u2019t have any legal recourse to prevent new data centers where current zoning allows them by right, before the county can put in place legislation to that effect.\nTurner said he\u2019s looking at \u201cinnovative ways\u201d the county might incentivize owners not to develop data centers along Route 7 in the meantime, such as offering \u201cland swaps with other areas of the county more appropriate for data centers.\u201d\nLast year Finmarc acquired Boston Properties' Virginia-95 Business Park; an 11-building flex/office, industrial, and data center site totaling 740,000 sq ft (68,750 sqm), for $127.5 million.\nGet a weekly roundup of North America news, direct to your inbox.\nTags\nWhitepapers\nMore\nImproving data center reliability and efficiency by solving power quality pain points\nSignificant Advancements in Rack PDU Power Quality\nData Center Sustainability Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWorkload Placement Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWatch Now: Building a digital society - What market trends will be driving the industry forward?\nBrowse by Topic\nBrowse by Region\nProducts\nData Centre Dynamics Ltd (DCD), 296-300 St John St, London EC1V 4PAEmail.
