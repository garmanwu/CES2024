It's a global bazaar featuring the best and worst tech ideas the industry has to offer. The products on display are by different turns wearable, pocketable, audible, rideable, mountable, and\u2014in some cases\u2014digestible. There are also a few dozen new cars to ogle, with most major automakers present. Here on this page, we'll be keeping a running report of everything we find interesting, from fascinating new EV concepts to bio-scanners to the latest smart home tech.\nLive coverage kicks off each day around 8 am Las Vegas time\u2014that's 11 am on the East Coast, 4 pm in the UK\u2014and will pause at the end of each day. We'll be here all week, so check back often.\nIf you buy something using links in our stories, we may earn a commission. This helps support our journalism.

The Pixel 7 Pro is at the top.\nLast year, Spectricity gave me a demo of a multispectral camera sensor and how it had the potential to disrupt several different product categories. Now, the company integrated it into a prototype smartphone to better showcase its utility. A multispectral camera sensor can capture far more colors than your typical smartphone. In one example, there was a Barbie in a lightbox against a pink backdrop surrounded by blue LEDs\u2014the Pixel 7 Pro turned the Barbie\u2019s skin blue because it was struggling to find a marker for white balance. Spectricity\u2019s prototype phone had no issues, and even after changing the color temperature a few times, it always delivered the most accurate colors. It was remarkable.\nAnother example showed the frustrations of trying to find the exact color of an item. Let\u2019s say you wanted to shop for paint\u2014even with a Pantone color card and Pantone\u2019s app, an iPhone suggested a completely different hue of orange than Spectricity\u2019s phone\u2014the team showed me a physical color swatch as a third comparison and the prototype\u2019s result was indeed incredibly accurate. You can imagine the utility of this in other applications from skin health, skincare, and more.\nSpectricity's prototype phone is on the right.\nYou might have seen mentions of a spectral sensor in some phones last year, but Spectricity says those sensors are only capturing a single point of information\u2014spectral information without the spatial information needed to get a clearer, whole picture. It says seven of the eight key smartphone brands in the world are currently evaluating its technology, and you\u2019ll likely start seeing this tech in a device in 2025. Don\u2019t worry, this won\u2019t mean all phone cameras will deliver the same results\u2014phone makers will still have the opportunity to add their style\u2014now just with far more accurate data.\nJulian Chokkattu\n5 days ago\nThere\u2019s a Smartphone With Color-Changing E Ink Tech, Plus E Ink Reading Glasses\nYou might have noticed that there\u2019s been an explosion in digital notebooks over the past year and a half\u2014so much so that we now have a guide picking out the best. First, everyone was making an ebook reader, then it was mostly just Amazon and the Kindle, and now there are several companies all-in on digital notebooks that let you write, type, and read. E Ink tells me most people\u2019s early experiences with e-readers were the slow refresh rate, but it has come a long way, and it takes some time for consumers to catch on. It\u2019s been putting a lot of focus on color E Ink screens lately\u2014last year we saw the BMW concept car with color-changing E Ink panels\u2014now there\u2019s a smartphone with a color-changing E Ink Prism backplate.\nThis new smartphone hails from Infinix, a Chinese brand whose phones are available in Asia, the Middle East, and Africa, and it\u2019s purely for aesthetics. Since E Ink is a low-power technology, it\u2019s not going to impact battery life much, and you\u2019re able to change up colors (though the design itself is limited to the shapes of the E Ink Prism segments). Expect to see color in more kinds of E Ink devices, like digital notebooks coming soon, as the company tells me it has always been the most requested feature from its partners and consumers.\nI also got a chance to see and don the upcoming Sol Reader E Ink glasses. It\u2019s an e-reader for your face, and you use a wireless puck to navigate and turn pages. Since you can look straight ahead to read, it\u2019ll put a lot less pressure on your neck. It does a good job of blocking out the world so there are fewer distractions too. They put a new meaning to \u201creading glasses.\u201d\nLouryn Strampe\n5 days ago\nThe ChefPaw Pet Food Maker Feeds Furry Friends for Less\nFeeding your pets a balanced diet can feel daunting, if not impossible. And it\u2019s expensive! (Shout out to my cat and her $80-a-bag dry food.) Enter the ChefPaw Pet Food Maker. It\u2019s part food processor, part cooker, and part app. Enter in your pet\u2019s activity levels, weight, and age, and you\u2019ll be met with a slew of customized recipes, each with balanced nutritional notes and ingredient lists. You can also create your own recipes or browse the ChefPaw community to find others\u2019 tried-and-true options. And there are filters for allergies, affordability, and other factors. In the future, you\u2019ll be able to order your pet\u2019s groceries for delivery from within the app. The app also provides step-by-step instructions, like adding a specific weight of rice followed by a specific portion of sweet potatoes. Press start, wait 40 minutes, and you\u2019ll have six pounds of nutritious pet food that\u2019s ready to be served or stored. Six hundred bucks might seem like a lot of money for a pet food maker, but ChefPaw\u2019s recipes cost as little as $1.80 per serving. In a multi-pet household, the machine pays for itself in a few weeks. Right now it\u2019s limited to dogs, but cats will be added soon, with small animals to follow. ChefPaw launched in August of 2023 and makers are shipping now.\nJulian Chokkattu\n5 days ago\nSamsung Thinks All-in-One Appliances Are the Future\nAll-in-one appliances usually get a bad rep. They try to do too many things and the end result is a mixed bag. That\u2019s often the case with most combo washer/dryers, but Samsung wants to prove otherwise with its new Bespoke AI Laundry Combo. This smart washer/dryer combo integrates many of the features available on Samsung\u2019s existing Bespoke AI Laundry appliances, like Fabric Care, which identifies some of the materials and changes the settings to make sure your clothes don\u2019t shrink or get damaged. There\u2019s also the 7-inch AI Hub display, which is how you control the machine and these same settings can be viewed on a Samsung TV or the SmartThings app on your phone, so you can start a cycle remotely. The Flex Auto Dispense System automatically chooses the right amount of detergent, the Auto Release Door opens the door when drying is done so that your clothes don\u2019t get damp if you forget to take them out, and there\u2019s a Less Microfiber cycle that purportedly reduces the shedding of microplastics by adjusting the motor\u2019s revolution speed.\nThree years went into developing the Combo, according to Samsung\u2019s Moohyung Lee, head of the Customer Experience Team of Digital Appliances Business, and a large part of that involved getting the heat pump technology just right. Heat pumps have soared in popularity over the past year as a more energy-efficient way to heat and cool homes. Samsung has been using it in its prior Bespoke washers and dryers\u2014it uses the refrigerant with the compressor instead of electricity to heat the air for the dryer. The company hopes its implementation in the AI Laundry Combo will change people\u2019s opinions of combo washer/dryers. \u201cUltimately the path forward will be this type of combined model,\u201d Lee says.\nIn the second half of this year, Samsung says it\u2019ll start to add generative AI to Bixby (of course), allowing you to communicate with all your Samsung appliances in a much more natural, conversational way, not just to control the appliance either. For example, if you\u2019re unsure whether you should put a silk shirt in a dryer, just ask Bixby. The Bespoke AI Laundry Combo is expected launch in the first quarter of 2024, though the price hasn\u2019t been announced yet.\n5 days ago\nHands-on With the Rabbit R1\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nRabbit's AI-powered walkie-talkie is one of the stars of CES. In the above video, WIRED's Julian Chokkattu gives a hands-on look at the device.\nBrenda Stolyar\n5 days ago\nMila\u2019s Halo is For Those Who Hate Cleaning Their Humidifiers\nHumidifiers are certainly useful for those with dry indoor air, but, to prevent the growth of mold and bacteria, you have to clean them often and thoroughly. Mila Halo is here to help make maintenance easier, by designing a humidifier (which also doubles as an air purifier) with a fully enclosed water system that keeps contaminants out of both the water and the air. Equipped with a dual-stage water filtration system, it removes microbial contaminants along with inorganic solids found in tap water. According to Mila, the entire system can extend tank life by up to 50 percent and keeps moisture from building up on surfaces. And, depending on whether the room is occupied, it can adjust its humidity accordingly. The price remains unclear, but the company says the Halo will be available later this fall.\nLouryn Strampe\n5 days ago\nChef AI Won\u2019t Burn Your Fries\nDean Khormaei burned his fries, and the rest, as they say, is history. After popping frozen fries in his air fryer and charring them to a crisp, he called up his longtime friend Max Deng. The two have since developed Chef AI, an air fryer that uses artificial intelligence to remove the guesswork from cooking. (As someone who is constantly googling \u201cbagel bites air fryer instructions\u201d, I for one am very excited.) Whether it\u2019s a handful of pizza rolls or an entire steak, the air fryer can figure out how to cook your food. Onboard sensors track temperature and mass, and there\u2019s a camera inside that works with Chef AI\u2019s deep learning model. By their powers combined, your fries will never be burned again. The co-founders said they\u2019re hoping for a ship date in Q4 2024 with a price point around $250. And yes, you\u2019ll be able to override the AI and just cook your food if you want to. But why would you want that?\nJeremy White\n5 days ago\nGoing Nowhere in Sony\u2019s Questionable Afeela Demo\nPhoto by Alex Welsh\nThe fruit of Sony's EV partnership with Honda, the Afeela, has previous form of being a highlight of CES, so we thought we\u2019d go check out how the collaboration electric car project was coming along before its scheduled production arrival in 2025. Our hopes of a even a slow car-park-restricted first drive were dashed however when, upon arriving at Sony\u2019s show booth, the demo offered comprised a static sit in the car, then a gamified setup with a facsimile of the Afeela\u2019s front interior.\nMuch like the Honda e, the Afeela\u2019s interior features a dashboard-wide screen with sections either end for video from digital wing mirrors (still a terrible invention). The screen can hold multiple windows that can be shifted around, and here is where you\u2019ll be able to remote-play PlayStation games, too. The demo of this was odd, though. On picking up the PS controller in the car, Sony\u2019s representative had trouble controlling the Horizon Zero Dawn character\u2019s actions on the dash display, so I asked if I could try, which revealed that the remote-play demo was just streamed video of gameplay. Am sure this will work eventually, but still there\u2019s no need to seemingly try and pretend a feature is working when it isn\u2019t.\nPhoto by Alex Welsh\nThe drive simulator was almost as disconcerting. You sit in a full mock-up of the front section of the Afeela\u2019s cabin, complete with accelerator and brake pedals, the full-screen dash, and the digital wing mirrors, as you then \u201cdrive\u201d around a city sticking rigidly to a predetermined path. Go off this path and the simulation immediately resets. The Sony rep seemed particularly excited at a feature where, when you select an option on the central display, it switches to a monster-strewn augmented reality representation of the view ahead. This is meant to be \u201cfun.\u201d I found it unbelievably distracting. We\u2019ll see if this feature makes it to the final car. For now, it feels like Sony should hold off on future Afeela demos until it\u2019s further along with its EV.\nJulian Chokkattu\n5 days ago\nWoosh\u2019s Smart Air Filters Are Finally Shipping\nPhoto by Julian Julian Chokkattu\nA month ago, I bought a $20 air filter for my HVAC in my home. I\u2019m supposed to change it every one to three months, but I wish I could know the best time to replace it. This is what Woosh wants to help with through its Smart Air Filter. The filter is from 3M, but it\u2019s the frame that\u2019s smart\u2014affix it into your HVAC duct without screwing anything in, and it can measure when your HVAC system is running. With this information, it offers a better measure of exactly when to replace your filter. In the companion app, you can buy replacement filters or set them to arrive automatically when your filter ends its life. The filter has a MERV 13 rating and costs $22 for refills, but the frame is $149. You can pair it with Woosh\u2019s Air Quality Monitor ($99), which works with smart home thermostats from Nest, Ecobee, and Sensi. You can see the air quality rating in your area, and if the monitor detects a drop in your actual home, it can ask your smart thermostat to run the HVAC fan to filter the air (without running the heating or cooling).\nThe company has had a few stumbles though. It originally launched a Kickstarter in 2022, then received some funding after appearing on Shark Tank, but Woosh missed its shipping deadline. It only started shipping out to backers late in 2023. Still, the concept is neat, and we\u2019ll be testing it out soon.\nLouryn Strampe\n5 days ago\nNimble\u2019s Robot Does Your Nails\u2014with the Help of AI\nCourtesy of Nimble\nIf a minifridge could paint your nails, it would probably look something like Nimble. Load up a color capsule pack, rest your fingers in the slot (which looks like a UV nail dryer), and press \u2018start\u2019 on your smartphone app or the machine itself, and in as little as 25 minutes you\u2019ll have a fresh manicure. (Note that thumbs are painted separately!) Inside the machine there\u2019s a robot arm that paints nails similarly to how a human would. It picks up the color, wipes off excess, and applies a coat of color. A fan dries nails between coats. AI is used to determine the difference between your nails and your skin, so the machine and its users improve over time. There\u2019s a slight learning curve\u2014as it turns out, fidgeting can throw off even the most advanced of nail technicians\u2014but the company compensates by applying slight pressure via a pad on the top of the finger slot. Reviewer Nena Farrell experienced Nimble firsthand at CES this week, and she said the pressure was similar to a weighted blanket holding her hand steady. Right now the machine is limited to single-color nails, but Nimble said more designs and applications are coming down the pipeline based on customer demand. The machine does require a Wi-Fi connection, and the faster your connection is, the faster your manicure will be finished.\nThere are over 30 variations of the vegan, cruelty-free nail polish capsules available. Each includes a base coat, a color, and a top coat. There\u2019s enough polish for two manicures in every capsule. They cost $10 each, making the manicure cost $5, while the machine is available for $599. That\u2019s a hefty investment, but for folks regularly getting their nails done at a salon, it\u2019ll pay for itself eventually. For a limited time, pre-orders come with $50 worth of bestselling polish capsules for free. Delivery is anticipated to start in March 2024; You can place a $99 deposit to reserve Nimble here.\nJulian Chokkattu\n5 days ago\nXebec\u2019s Magnetic Portable Monitor Snap System Is So Dang Smart\nPhoto by Julian Julian Chokkattu\nI love portable monitors, mostly because I need a second screen wherever I\u2019m working to feel efficient. One of my favorites I\u2019ve tested is Mobile Pixel\u2019s Duex Plus, which magnetically attaches to the back of your laptop and has a screen that slides out, so you don\u2019t need additional desk space. At CES 2024 I saw a version of this style of portable monitor that seems far more elegant. It\u2019s called the Xebec Snap and it was announced last summer but only started shipping to consumers in December 2023. You affix a shell over your laptop\u2019s screen\u2014it\u2019s a clamp, so it can fit screens up to 17 inches\u2014and on the sides are magnetic attachment points where you can pop on up to two 13.3-inch Full HD screens. There\u2019s even a built-in kickstand on the back of the clamp to prevent your laptop\u2019s screen from tipping backward from the weight.\nThe clamp has two USB-C cables (you can also use USB-A) for hooking the system up to your laptop, but the screens themselves are wireless, which makes for some nice cable management, and it also means you can use the screens in landscape or portrait orientation. The company also showed off concept accessories it hopes to make later this year that can attach to the same magnetic points, like a video light to light up your face during video calls, and a MagSafe wireless charger for docking your phone next to your laptop. Smart! You can purchase it now, with the dual-screen option starting at $549, and the Tri-Screen costing $999.\nJulian Chokkattu\n5 days ago\nKeychron Marks Its Debut at CES With a \u201cHall Effect\u201d Keyboard\nPhoto by Julian Julian Chokkattu\nKeychron makes some of my favorite mechanical keyboards\u2014they\u2019re weighty and well-built, satisfying to type on, and quite customizable. The company skyrocketed to popularity over the last few years and this is its inaugural appearance at CES 2024. Its latest ware? The Keychron Q1 HE (the HE stands for \u201cHall Effect\u201d), a 75 percent wireless magnetic switch keyboard. Companies like Wooting have used analog magnetic switches before, but Keychron\u2019s peripheral can connect wireless via Bluetooth or a 2.4-GHz dongle.\nEssentially, HE keyboards have magnets inside each keyboard switch (the piece under the keycap that registers your keypress). There\u2019s a sensor in the keyboard that responds to changes to the magnetic field from keypresses, allowing much more granular control over the sensitivity of each key. That means you can configure keypresses to actuate from a very light touch\u2014or the opposite\u2014which can be helpful in fast-paced shooter games. You can customize all of this with Keychron\u2019s new web app, which you can also use to remap keys. You can preorder the Q1 HE now for $219, and it ships in April.\nAdrienne So\n6 days ago\nWithings' Little Wand Measures Your Vitals\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nThe Withings BeamO, which debuted this week at CES, is what's known as a multiscope. You can use it to measure your temperature and blood oxygen levels or take an EKG reading, and you can use it as a stethoscope to listen for heart irregularities. All in one little wand. It doesn't dispense medical advice\u2014the idea is that you can send the data reports to your doctor and then discuss them together\u2014but it's nice to have this level of diagnostic capture in something that's accessible and easy to use. It will cost $250 once it wins FDA approval.\nAdrienne So\n6 days ago\nWe Tested Bosch EBikes Around Red Rocks Canyon\nSo many bikes!\nWith all the outdoor gear at this show, it seems a shame that we have to spend so much of our time scurrying around inside fluorescent-lit convention halls. That\u2019s why I was thrilled to get off the Vegas Strip for a little bit for a Bosch test ride with about a dozen different Bosch-powered electric bikes from several different brands that use the company\u2019s electric drivetrains, including Riese & Muller, Gazelle, Trek, and Tern. I joined a group of journalists at Red Rocks Canyon National Conservation Area just outside the city.\nThe theme was Bosch\u2019s e-cargo and SUV bicycles (I was on a Trek Fetch+ 2, although I did take turns on several other rides). Probably the most noteworthy update to the Bosch eBike system that I found was the Auto eShift system, which automatically adjusted the power output to maintain my level of effort and speed. It\u2019s amazing but takes some getting used to. I stopped on an uphill to put my phone back in the mount and was shocked to find how easy it was to get restarted; I also found myself fiddling with the shifting a lot, because I couldn\u2019t figure out why it wasn\u2019t hard to pedal up a trail with 1,100 feet of elevation gain.\nThe integration with the updated Bosch eBike Flow app was also pretty nice. I connected my bike to the app and mounted it on the handlebars, which charged my phone with the bike battery. Buttons by the handlebar let me easily flip through the screens, and the app is also compatible with other major health and fitness platforms and equipment\u2014you can export data from the Bosch app to Apple Health or Strava, for example. Given all the software upgrades, it was difficult to concentrate a lot on the bikes themselves.\nIt\u2019s worth noting that I\u2019m fine with any and all software updates, as long as the experience of biking remains the same: completely fun, whizzing up and down through picturesque hills in the desert sun. There were definitely stray yells and whoops as we sped along, and not all of them were from me. At one point during the ride, Bosch general manager Claudia Wasko turned to me with a big grin and said, \u201cThis is work!\u201d And it is! The most fun work possible.\nMichael Calore\n6 days ago\nJulian Has Decided Laptops Are Over\nMr. Future files a story.\nIt's hard to justify engaging in stunt journalism at big, physically demanding events like CES, but WIRED's senior reviews editor Julian Chokkattu is always game for a challenge. Today at CES, he has decided that he won't use a regular computer all day. Instead, he is only allowing himself to use this Nimo Planet Spatial Computer. The smart glasses plug into a tiny palm-sized computer called the Core. The Core has a touch-sensitive top for pointer input. It also has an accelerometer, so it can be used like Wiimote to point and click. The Bluetooth keyboard completes the package. Passersby keep stopping to stare and take photos, and I cannot blame them one bit.\nMichael Calore\n6 days ago\nSegway's Xyber Goes 100 Miles on Dirt, Pavement, Gravel, Whatever\nThe number of ebikes that straddle the line between motorcycle and bicycle is growing quickly. The latest model from Segway, the Xyber, is one such hybrid beast. It houses two 1,440-watt-hour battery packs in the middle of the frame, and with both installed (as shown here) the range of the two-wheeler extends to almost 100 miles. That's a whole lot of adventuring. The suspension has four and a half inches of travel, and the knobby tires can handle gravel and unpaved backroads, but it's still incredibly zippy and fun on pavement. The X-shaped headlight lets everyone know they're about to be passed by a cyberpunk commando.\nJeremy White\n6 days ago\nHave a Chat With Wehead\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\nWho head? What head? It's Wehead, a table-top hardware interface for ChatGPT. If it looks like four Samsung phones stuck together to approximate a human face, that's because it is.\nMedea Giordano\n6 days ago\nPetcube Adds an Affordable GPS and Activity Tracker to Its Lineup\nPetcube is known for its affordable pet cameras, and now the brand has launched its first wearable for dogs. Attach it to your pet's collar to set up a track their location, monitor daily activities, and set and track their fitness goals. You can also set up a geofence that alerts you if they wander too far from home.\nIn the app, you can pull up your pet\u2019s location at any time, but if they actually get lost, Lost Dog Mode speeds up the updates by reporting your pet's location once every second rather than once every 1 to 3 minutes. This does drain the battery faster since it's more data-intensive, but regular use should give you about 30 days of battery life.\nThe case is transparent, which doesn\u2019t just look cool\u2014'90s clear tech is my special interest\u2014but the clear plastic also glows in the dark and has built-in LEDs for nighttime safety. Sound alerts can also be activated to help locate a hiding animal.\nThe tracker costs $53, though it\u2019s discounted to $40 right now. You\u2019ll have to pay a monthly fee to get the data services, and there are several options available. If you pay for a year, a basic subscription costs $84 ($7 a month) and the premium version costs $96 ($8 a month). There are monthly, two-year, and five-year options too. A premium subscription also comes with vet connection right in the app and a lifetime warranty. Petcube\u2019s app can be aggravating to use\u2014the cost alone usually makes the app issues bearable\u2014but we\u2019ll test this tracker when we can.\nNena Farrell\n6 days ago\nOwlet\u2019s Newest Baby Monitors Get FDA Approval, But Maybe Wait For a Prescription\nOwlet has been making baby sock monitors for a few years now, but the newest models are approved by the FDA for tracking your baby\u2019s vitals. There\u2019s two different versions of the new sock: the Dream Sock, which anyone can purchase, and the BabySat, which promises hospital-grade monitoring and can only be purchased with a prescription from a doctor. Both models can track the pulse rate, oxygen, wakings, and sleep trends of babies ranging from newborn to about 18 months old. Owlet describes the two as the same, just one requires a prescription. The pulse rate and oxygen monitoring are likely a little over the top for most parents monitoring their baby\u2019s sleep habits, but I\u2019m still planning to test it on my one year old to see what the experience is like. I\u2019m more intrigued about the prescription BabySat, and how often parents of premature and NICU babies might be prescribed it now that it\u2019s on the market. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll be watching this year.\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast. All rights reserved.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 live: Latest tech, weird gadgets and our Best of CES awards\nIt's Day 3 of CES \u2014 time to announce our favorite products of this year's show!\nIt's the Engadget team's last full day in Las Vegas for CES 2024. We\u2019ve already published over 160 articles about the event, and we'll have plenty more to come today.\nToday we'll be bringing you more first looks at new devices from across show's many locations. There are over 4,000 exhibitors here at CES, and we've still got plenty of products to bring you impressions of. As we did yesterday, we\u2019ll be running a liveblog through most of the day to bring you the biggest news, some commentary and lots of images and videos, along with some links to our more in-depth coverage. We'll also be announcing our annual Best of CES awards this afternoon, with 12 awards to come in total.\nThat's a wrap!\nThat's a wrap on our CES liveblog for this year. Thanks to everyone who tuned in over the past few days \u2014 it's been a blast writing as a faceless Engadget avatar. We hope you've been entertained, informed and ocassionally horrified by what we've put out this week.\nWhile our blogging marathon is at an end, Engadget's CES coverage will continue, with plenty of previews and analysis to come tomorrow! You can keep up with all the news from CES right here, and while we have your attention, you can sign up for our newsletter to get a daily dose of tech in your inbox right here.\nXOXO, the Engadget CES liveblog team.\nWhat is Bluetooth Auracast and why should you care?\nOne of the key advantages of Bluetooth LE Audio is Auracast: a way to broadcast content to connected devices in public settings. It will also allow you to easily connect multiple wireless speakers to each other with diving into an app. Perhaps most importantly, the barrier to entry is going to be very low since a dedicated Auracast app will be built into mobile platforms like iOS and Android. What's more, you'll select available channels like you would a Bluetooth device or a Wi-Fi network. It's simple, and it's presented in a way that people who've used a smartphone are familiar with. Auracast has been mentioned constantly by companies announcing their new audio gear at CES 2024, so here's what you need to know about it.\nRead the full story here.\nTouring LG\u2019s high-tech camping trailer at CES 2024\nLG\u2019s Labs department often takes technology and existing products and spins them into lifestyle-heavy ideas and notions. LG Labs was responsible for the Dukebox, a vacuum tube-driven speaker with a transparent OLED screen, an LG Gram with two displays, and several other projects. But the LG Bon Voyage concept trailer is a little more involved, packing so many of LG\u2019s CES \u201cgreatest hits,\u201d retooled and restyled for near-future camping that\u2019s both incredibly comfortable and\u2026 unlikely.\nThe trailer is 2 meters by 3.8 meters, measuring up to a height of 2.2 meters. LG\u2019s explanation suggests you\u2019d be able to pick and choose which appliances and features are included.\nRead the full story here.\nJackery's rooftop solar tent makes overlanding more environmentally friendly\nThe Jackery Solar Generator for Rooftop Tent is equipped with 1,000W solar panels (with a 25 percent efficiency rate). Unlike the flimsy panels you can currently buy, these are rigid slide-out units that should offer a sturdier canopy under which to sleep. Once you\u2019ve parked up and opened the tent, the panels are wired up to an Explorer 1,000 Plus generator. That\u2019ll hold 1,264Wh of power and can output at rates up to 2,000W, enough to power a 900W cooker for an hour. Plus, you can daisy-chain other batteries alongside to increase the storage further for longer trips away from an outlet and/or civilization.\nRead the full story here.\nCurrent Backyard's electric smart grills bring outdoor cooking to more places\nGas, charcoal and pellet grills are great for taking your cooking outdoors, but a lot of people live in apartments and other spots where open flames aren't permitted. At CES 2024, Current Backyard debuted two all-electric grills that can be used in those places since the heating element for both isn't much different than an oven or stove. And because grilling has entered the modern age, both of these are Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connected, so you can monitor progress and adjust temperatures from your favorite comfy chair.\nRead the full story here.\nThis moss terrarium doubles as an air purifier and humidifier\nYears ago, some genius decided to build Las Vegas in the middle of a desert, so for me, any sight of unique humidifying tech at CES is a much welcomed sight. It just so happened that a Korean company showcased a device dubbed Moss Air which, as the name implies, uses real moss to purify air. It's also built with a humidifying feature that can shoot outwards or rehydrate the plant internally. In short, you're getting an air-purifying humidifier that doubles as a mesmerizing miniature foggy terrarium on your desktop.\nRead the full story here.\nThe best of CES 2024\nThanks for tuning in to our awards! You can find all of the winners right here. In the meantime, there's more news and impressions to catch you up on. Let's get back to it!\nBest in show: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nCES 2024 is often described as a TV show or car show, but sometimes it\u2019s more niche products that capture our imagination. GE Profile\u2019s Smart Indoor Smoker is a countertop device that makes proper barbecue in your kitchen without filling your home with smoke. It\u2019s designed to move air around the food to impart maximum smokiness inside, without letting airflow out. When your brisket, chicken or whatever is done, a filtration and catalyst system draws the smoke down, eventually expelling it as warm air.\nTypically smoking food requires constant adjustments and vigilance, but the Smart Indoor Smoker has six preset cooking modes, while you\u2019re able to adjust the degree of smokiness between five different levels. The wood pellets\u2019 only function is to add flavor and not fuel the actual cooking process, so only a handful are needed per smoke session.\nGE included a smart probe with the Smart Indoor Smoker too, so you can monitor the cooking process from a companion app and its Smoke and Hold feature can cook and smoke foods and keep them at food-safe temperatures for up to 24 hours. It\u2019s not small (it's around the size of a mini fridge), but it\u2019s stylish and simple to use, with a low barrier to entry for anyone tempted to try smoking their own foods. The device was also able to impart an impressive level of smokiness in only a few hours \u2014 we can\u2019t wait to see what low-and-slow smoking could do.\nEcoFlow Delta Ultra\nA whole-home battery and inverter system is far from the funkiest bit of hardware we saw at CES, but it\u2019s likely one of the more useful. The EcoFlow DELTA Pro Ultra can take in and store power from your rooftop solar panels then use the stored energy to power your home. The DELTA Pro Ultra can even suck up juice from the grid when it's cheaper, and feed it back when energy prices surge.\nA base configuration goes for $5,800 and includes one 6kWh battery and inverter, but you can stack up to five batteries per inverter and chain up to three inverter-and-battery stacks, amounting to a 90kWh capacity. That\u2019s a beastly amount of power that could keep a McMansion humming at full tilt for a few days \u2014 or run essential appliances in a more moderately sized home for a month or longer.\nThe DELTA Pro Ultra can also hook into an existing transfer switch if you have one, but for deeper integration with your home\u2019s power system, the subpanel-like Smart Home Panel 2 gives you features like app control, weather and power grid monitoring, and instant switchover to backup when the power goes out. As more solar panels are installed on rooftops, a sleek and powerful all-in-one battery solution like this can give people more control over how their power is used. If you\u2019re intrigued, you don\u2019t have to wait \u2014 it\u2019s one of many CES 2024 gadgets already on the market.\nMicron LPCAMM2 laptop RAM modules\nIf you've ever been annoyed that you couldn't upgrade your RAM in an ultraportable laptop, Micron has a potential solution: LPCAMM2 memory. It's a new form factor that's 64 percent smaller than standard SODIMM RAM sticks, and it's also potentially far faster and more efficient. Best of all is that it's a self-contained unit that can easily be removed and upgraded down the line.\nLPCAMM2 RAM won't get as much hype as AI PCs, but it's something that could transform what's possible with future laptop designs. And if it means laptop makers stop soldering RAM directly onto motherboards, we'll call it a win.\nSamsung Ballie\nCES was a little light on notable robots this year, but Samsung revived one we loved when we first saw it way back in 2020. Ballie is an adorable, bowling ball-sized robot that rolls around your home, following you around like a robotic pet that's eager to please. Ballie is a lot bigger than it was when we saw it in 2020, and it now has a built-in 1080p projector so it can both show you things and speak to you when you ask it for help. Think of it like a Nest Hub on wheels.\nWe only got to see Ballie in a tightly-plotted demo at Samsung's booth, but it was simply delightful to watch Ballie roll around projecting workout routines, calendar updates and recipe videos on the walls. As with most smart home gadgets, there's a little bit of \"solution searching for a problem\" here. But it feels like Samsung nailed the form factor judging by how smoothly Ballie navigated its way around the demo area. And while many companies show off products like this that have no chance of actually reaching people in the real world, Samsung says Ballie will go on sale this year.\nKia Platform Beyond Vehicles (PBV)\nKia\u2019s PBV, or Platform Beyond Vehicles, concept is the rare car concept (or concepts, plural) that seems like it might actually be a real thing in the relatively near future. The PV5 is likely to be the first to make the leap. It\u2019s a small modular van that can be equipped with a taller roof for extra headroom, or turned into a pickup by swapping out the back two-thirds. It can also be turned into a taxi with extra seating for passengers.\nOne of the more interesting things is how the members of the PBV family, including the larger PV7 and the smaller PV1 are expected to work together. For instance, Kia imagines a rail system that can connect a PV7 directly to a PV1, transferring cargo to the smaller vehicle for last mile deliveries.\nMost importantly, PBV isn\u2019t some fantastical dream vehicle that will never be heard from again: Kia is already building a dedicated factory in Korea that\u2019s expected to be ready to pump out 150,000 vehicles in 2025.\nGyrogear GyroGlove\nThe number of accessibility and aging-related products that were good enough for us to consider for awards at CES 2024 was encouragingly high. We saw a tongue-operated touchpad, a hearing aid-like system that can isolate individual speakers in a noisy crowd and a visual radar for gamers with hearing loss. But GyroGlove stood out for a few reasons.\nThe device uses a sophisticated gyroscope to help those with hand tremors (say, Parkinson's patients) stabilize their movement, but one of the deciding factors in picking it as a winner is the fact that it's actually available. The company said it's already in talks with the chief medical officers of several insurance providers in the US, and has registered the GyroGlove as a medical device with the FDA and Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration. It's certified by various international standards organizations, to boot.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nSennheiser's Momentum True Wireless series has consistently earned the accolade of the best-sounding earbuds in our best of list for a while now. However, the company never really had the complete package to knock Sony's 1000X series off the top spot. At CES this year, Sennheiser debuted the fourth-gen version of its flagship earbuds, which bring a host of upgrades. They still sound excellent, ANC and transparency mode are also improved.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 did a great job blocking out the noisy Las Vegas suite, allowing us to focus on the selection of jazz we used to demo the earbuds. Transparency mode also sounded more natural, which will be a big help for calls and tuning into your surroundings. What's more, Sennheiser figured out a way for active noise cancellation to not drain the battery nearly as much as it typically does; the ANC here only cuts listening time by half an hour.\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nWhen it comes to smoking meat at home, your options are usually limited to outdoor grills that burn charcoal, pellets or wood. If you live at a place where your landlord doesn't allow open flames, like apartments, then you're pretty much out of luck. The GE Profile Smoker ditches the flames for electric heating elements and brings low-and-slow smoking indoors.\nThe GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is no gimmick either. It\u2019s capable of infusing significant smoke flavor via wood pellets as we experienced first hand this week. There won't be any smoke wafting around your kitchen as the unit captures all of that with its filtration system. If you need to cook while you're away, a unique feature does that and then holds your food at a safe temperature until you're ready to serve. Toss in Wi-Fi for remote cooking and monitoring, cooking profiles and guidance, plus the Clear Smoke tool for when you need to open the door, and the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker has a lot to offer a range of skill levels.\nWithings BeamO\nThere\u2019s never a shortage of health and fitness tech at CES. This year Withings stood out with its $250 BeamO \u201cmultiscope.\u201d It combines a body temperature sensor, an electrocardiogram, an oximeter and a digital stethoscope into one surprisingly light consumer device that promises to make it easier to collect basic health metrics at home. The company's Health Mate app collects all of that data, which can then be sent to doctors with a few taps. Withings is also seeking FDA approvals for the BeamO to be able to detect atrial fibrillation.\nBeamO impressed us not only with its versatility and fairly affordable price, but also for the potential impact it could have on telemedicine. Providing your doctor with key metrics ahead of a call or visit could make it easier for them to give you sound medical advice. And those with chronic conditions could use BeamO to keep track of health data over the long term.\nASUS ZenBook Duo\nASUS has been chasing the dream of dual-screen notebooks for a while, but this year's ZenBook Duo appears to be its best attempt yet. It consists of two separate components: a dual-screen display unit and a detachable Bluetooth keyboard. You can use the ZenBook Duo in a typical clamshell mode, with the keyboard in front of one of its displays. But when you have more room, you can open up the display to have two screens sitting on top of each other (balanced on a built-in kickstand).\nThe ZenBook Duo also feels incredibly polished, and it has high-end hardware like Intel's Core Ultra chips and gorgeous OLED screens. It also starts at a reasonable $1,500, making it a dual-screen laptop for the masses.\nTCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro\nWith its third-generation NXTPAPER display, TCL\u2019s latest 14-inch tablet combines the best things about LCD displays and e-readers. You get a sharp 2.8K-resolution panel with bright colors plus a special nano-coating that not only reduces glare, but also cuts down excess blue light while providing a lovely matte texture. And for those who prefer a more traditional newspaper-like reading experience, there\u2019s a monochrome mode that makes the NXTPAPER 14 Pro look like it has an e-ink screen. So while its specs aren\u2019t all that impressive (MediaTek Dimensity 8020, 12GB of RAM and 256GB of storage), TCL\u2019s new tablet is one of those rare gadgets that appeals to both hardcore tech nerds and traditionalists that still remember a time before everything went digital.\nLG Signature OLED T\nOLED TVs are great. An OLED TV you can see through \u2014 well, that\u2019s just wild. The LG Signature OLED T isn\u2019t the first transparent display we\u2019ve seen at CES, but it is the first that will actually be sold to consumers (unlike Samsung\u2019s similar transparent MicroLED concept).\nThis is a 77-inch set with an retractable contrast screen. Keep the filter up, and it looks like one of LGs standard, excellent OLED sets. Bring it down, and the image almost looks like it\u2019s floating in mid-air. Like Samsung\u2019s Frame TVs, the Signature OLED T is designed for ambience \u2014 when you\u2019re not watching a show or movie, it can display little animations (a digital fish tank, for instance). To help it feel less obtrusive, the TV also uses LG\u2019s wireless Zero Connect tech, which relegates most of the set\u2019s I/O (and thus cables) to a separate box that can be tucked away elsewhere.\nThe TV does lack the microlens array tech found in LG\u2019s absolute best OLED TVs and LG isn\u2019t sure if it will come with the furniture you see in the image above. The company says it will ship sometime in 2024, though there\u2019s no firm release date yet. But whenever it does arrive, it will almost certainly be prohibitively expensive for most people.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung's line of Frame TVs, first introduced back in 2017, do a great job of disguising a large-screen TV as a piece of art. The Samsung Music Frame does the same thing, but for wireless speakers. Instead of a screen, there's a place to display art or album covers that you swap pretty easily.\nThis wouldn't be noteworthy if the Music Frame didn't sound good \u2014 but in our demo, it did. The Music Frame includes two woofers, two tweeters and two mid-range drivers and supports Dolby Atmos. It's also quite the flexible speaker, working on its own, in a stereo pair or connected to a TV as part of a bigger home theater setup. It's even wall-mountable. We have no price or release date, but given Samsung's success with the Frame TVs, we imagine they won't wait long to get the Music Frame on the market.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: Everything you need to know about the camera and tech showcase\nThe world's biggest technology show, CES 2024 is taking place in Las Vegas next week.\u00a0What camera kit will be there?\nCES 2024, the biggest technology event in the world, is taking place next week \u2013\u00a0and it's going to be the site of some huge announcements in the world of electronics.\nAs always (at least, when there's not a pandemic), CES 2024 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada and runs from January 09-12. Last year saw 117,000 visitors and 3,200 exhibitors at the event, including the biggest technology giants such as Google and Microsoft.\nOf specific interest to us, of course, are the imaging giants who are participating at this year's show: Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Adobe. While CES 2024 is a general technology showcase, not one dedicated to photography or videography in specific, it has been used as a launchpad for cameras and imaging tech. And with both video and AI being cornerstones of this year's event, we're sure to see some exciting launches.\nFull details on the show can be found at the CES website.\u00a0For now, here's what we're excited about and what we expect to see\u2026\nWhen is CES 2024?\nCES 2023 will take place in its traditional home of Las Vegas, Nevada, running from Tuesday January 09 to Friday January 12.\nThe event emanates from the Las Vegas Convention Center. If you're in the area, attendance details are on the CES website.\nWhat do we expect at CES 2024?\nSony\nWord has it that Sony could announce five cameras this year, among them the Sony A1 II, A7S IV, FX3 II and ZV-E10 II. With all of these featuring headline video capabilities, it would certainly be the right time and place to debut at the video-obsessed CES.\nPersonally I think it's waaaaaay too early for a Sony A1 successor, though with a new rumor that the company could replace the Sony A7S III (and the A7S line altogether) and the Sony FX3 with the FX3 II, this feels like a new pillar that would be well-cemented in Las Vegas.\nPanasonic\nThere's been plenty of chatter about replacements for the Panasonic S1 / S1R, Panasonic S1H and Panasonic GH6. And given that the company launched the Panasonic S5X and S5 IIX last January, it's entirely possible that an S1R II, S1H II and GH7 could be revealed at CES 2024.\nOf course, as a general tech giant, we could see plenty of other adjacent imaging breakthroughs. At last year's show Panasonic announced \"life changing\" smart glasses, made in conjunction with Biel Glasses, using AI to help users with impaired vision.\nHeck, maybe we might finally see Panasonic announce something 8K-related\u2026\nCanon\nWill CES 2024 be the launchpad for the highly anticipated Canon EOS R1? We all know that the new flagship is on the way, and that it's intended to launch in time for the Paris Olympics, so time is running out for Canon to show it to the world.\nThere are plenty of other possibilities, too. The Canon EOS R5 II feels a little ambitious, but Canon has a habit of showcasing its latest collection of concept cameras \u2013\u00a0many of which have made it to market, such as the Canon PowerShot Zoom and Canon PowerShot Pick. These are always fascinating glimpses into the future, and I'm excited to see what's on show this year!\nNikon\nAfter a knockout year in 2023, Nikon could capitalize by taking the bull by the horns early in 2024. The likeliest candidate to me would be the Nikon Z6 III, which is widely expected to be here any minute.\nThere has also been a wild rumor about a Nikon Z9H \u2013\u00a0a speed-oriented version of the Nikon Z9. The \"H\" is ostensibly a nod to the suffix Nikon used to give to its flagship cameras to denote particular performance specialisms \u2013\u00a0such as the Nikon D1H, which was a speed-oriented upgrade of the base D1.\u00a0Personally I'll believe this one when I see it!\nFujifilm\nThis feels like a bit of a long shot, as Fujifilm is usually more at home announcing products on its home turf at CP+. That said, with reports that the manufacturer will launch more cameras in January alone than it did in 2023 as a whole, a launch or announcement isn't out of the question.\nWhat could this be? Well, a follow-up to the Fujifilm X100V is widely expected \u2013 and given what a blockbuster success that camera was, it could be a good fit for the broader-appeal of CES 2024. An outside chance would be the Instax Mini 99, which sounds like it might be a disruptive product.\nCES 2024 announcements\nLaCie Rugged Mini SSD\nThe palm-sized LaCie Rugged Mini SSD has been announced in capacities up to 4TB offering IP54 dust and rain resistance, 3-meter drop protection and 1-ton car pressure resistance.\u00a0No need to baby your portable SSD any more!\nLaCie claims write speeds of up to 2000MB/s, with USB 3.2 gen 2x2 and compatibility with USB 40Gbps, USB 10Gps, Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts including the latest Apple iPad, iPhone and Macbooks. Prices start at $79.99 for 500GB and go up to $349.99 for 4TB.\nFull story: LaCie adds to its famous Rugged lineup with a new palm-sized SSD\nWith a good few days to go until the event kicks off, there will be plenty more news, announcements and leaks between now and doors opening. Stay tuned to this page where we'll keep you updated with all the launches as they happen!\nWe're expecting to see some of the best cameras for video and maybe even the best cameras for vlogging announced at the show, along with AI improvements to the best photo editing software and the best video editing software.\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\nGet the Digital Camera World Newsletter\nThe best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!\nThe editor of Digital Camera World, James has 21 years experience as a journalist and started working in the photographic industry in 2014 (as an assistant to Damian McGillicuddy, who succeeded David Bailey as Principal Photographer for Olympus).

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.
