        "raw_content": "Climate AI vendor Persefoni sequred $50 mn in Series C1 led by TPG Rise\nUS-based climate software vendor Persefoni has launched of its latest AI product (PersefoniGPT) and a $50 million funding round led by TPG Rise, with additional investment from Alumni Ventures, Bain and Co., Clearvision Ventures, EDF, ENEOS Innovation Partners, NGP Energy Technology Partners, Prelude Ventures, Parkway Ventures and Rise Investment Group.\nThis follows several previous funding rounds, including $101 million Series B funding in 2021, and brings the total amount of investment to almost $165 million.\nThis funding follows other VC investments in carbon management software, such as Watershed\u2019s $55 million Series B funding round in June and nZero\u2019s $16 million Series A funding round in April.\nThis fundraising also signifies a vote of confidence in the role that AI will play in carbon emissions management. Automation is a crucial tool in reducing the technical and logistical challenges that arise when gathering, transforming and analysing vast quantities of dispersed data.\nThis Series C round represents a significant vote of confidence in our strategic vision, our product and sales execution, and our commitment to bringing best-in-class climate software solutions to our customers\nThis new investment not only ensures ability to provide industry-leading support to our global customers, but it also enables us to double down on our existing, successful AI developments.\nThese challenges are often most apparent in Scope 3 emissions management. Many platforms already use supervised machine learning for data standardization, data quality control, emissions factor allocation and emissions abatement initiative identification.\nAdditionally, Norwegian vendor Position Green uses generative AI capabilities to provide basic descriptive data analysis.\nSince being founded in 2020, Persefoni has demonstrated a unique focus on AI, both incorporating as \u2018Persefoni AI Inc.\u2019 and appointing co-founder Kim Stroh as Head of AI.\nSince 2022, AI has become an increasingly prominent element of Persefoni\u2019s product offering. In April 2023, an initial model to help users map data types was supplemented with the arrival of Persefoni AI, offering capabilities that enabled automated anomaly and error detection and resolution, and suggestive emission factor allocation.\nThe latest release, PersefoniGPT, expands the current AI portfolio into generative capabilities, acting as a co-pilot product to support and educate Persefoni clients.\nFunctions include guidance on regulation, management processes and platform features, intelligent alerts, a chat function, and suggestive analytical decision-making. This will aid in bridging the widening knowledge gap that is emerging as corporates are required to take on increasingly complex emissions-related responsibilities.\nPersefoni AI Inc. provides businesses, financial institutions, and governmental agencies the software fabric for managing their organization\u2019s climate-related data, disclosures, and performance with the same level of rigor and confidence as their financial reporting systems.\nby Peter Sonner\nUK Life Insurance Sector Outlook for 2024 is Improving\nInsured Losses from Noto Peninsula Earthquake in Japan Forcasts\nComparing Real Estate Investment Strategies in Dubai vs Major US Cities\nLargest Natural Disasters Review: Thunderstorms & Earthquakes Cost\nbeinsure saves your money on insurance & investment"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nAI at CES 2024: Biggest announcements so far\nChatGPT in cars and grills with AI\nAlmost every announcement, keynote, and product at CES 2024 so far has included some type of update on of artificial intelligence.\u00a0From LG\u2019s robot butler to a grill that uses AI to improve cooking time and quality, the technology of the day is everywhere.\nIn some cases, AI is just a part of a bigger product, like using vision technology in a robot vacuum to improve object avoidance.\u00a0Elsewhere it is the entire announcement, such as Samsung going \u201call in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its product range.\nPart of this is so companies can capitalize on the hype surrounding AI, which anecdotally makes it easier to get funding. The bigger part is that the technology has matured to a point where it brings significant improvements in some areas.\nWhat has been announced around AI at CES 2024\nTo better break down the hype and find the real gems I\u2019ve pulled together some of the biggest announcements in the AI space at CES 2024.\nLG unveils smart home robot\nLG kicked off its CES showcase with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a \u201cZero Labor Home.\u201d\u00a0This AI-powered butler bot can organize your smart devices and even keep an eye on your pets when you\u2019re not home.\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for potential issues, and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience.\nThanks to the inclusion of Qualcomm\u2019s Robotics RB5 Platform, LG's robot uses AI to learn your interests and behaviors and get better over time at serving as a friendly home companion.\nSamsung declares \u201cAI for all\u201d at CES\nSamsung has been pushing the AI in everything narrative since last year and its keynote at CES \u2014 dubbed \"AI for all\" \u2014 turned out to be no different. The company makes everything from smartphones to home appliances and AI will be incorporated across the full range of products.\nWe've already seen details of refrigerators with cameras and AI vision technology. This allows the device to recommend recipes based on what it can see in the fridge. The company has also unveiled televisions with AI built in that can scale content to improve resolution and enhance the depth perception of an image. And there are also robot mops and vacuums that use AI to seek out stains.\nSamsung's biggest AI announcement may be yet to come. Next week, the company hosts Galaxy Unpacked, where it's expected to introduce the new Galaxy S24 lineup of smartphones. Samsung has already made it very clear that AI will play a central role with its next flagship devices.\nNvidia expands AI dominance\nDespite a near dominance in AI hardware for the past year, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. This is likely due to increased competition from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm in chips capable of running and training models.\nThe company unveiled the GeForce RTX series of desktop graphics cards that, while specifically aimed at the gaming sector, also have a \u201cready for AI\u201d feel.\nNot to be left out, AMD also unveiled its new Hawk Line CPUs complete with AI technology.\nMost of the AI is delivered through software capable of seamlessly offloading certain tasks to the neural processing units inside the new series of chipsets.\nAI coming to a car near you\nVolkswagen was one of a number of car companies announcing wider use of artificial intelligence as part of its in-car entertainment system.\nThe German carmaker is bringing OpenAI's ChatGPT to its vehicles, integrated into its existing IDA voice assistant to give it a more natural conversation style and ability to complete more complex requests\nAlso in the vehicle space, Bosch launched a pair of new AI-powered technologies at CES. The eye-tracking technology can see whether you are looking drowsy when you are driving, ask if you need a coffee when you get home and program your coffee machine to have a drink ready when you walk through the door.\nThe other eye-tracking tech from Bosch could be used while driving to determine what you're looking at and other information about the street sign, building or object. This could even include tell you the opening times of a nearby store or restaurant.\nCooking and cleaning with AI\nOne of the hottest tickets at AI is a smart grill that can reach a staggering 1,652\u00b0 F and cook the perfect ribeye steak in 90 seconds.\nSeergrills says\u00a0that its Perfecta grill uses a powerful quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure aspects of the food and environment, including thickness and temperature. This lets you control the cook and get perfect results every time.\nTo clean up the messes made from eating all that grilled food you need a mop or vacuum. Roborock's latest device uses AI to let it detect obstacles, find complex stains and even call home when it has an issue.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Persefoni Raises $50 Million Series C-1 Funding And Doubles Down On AI\nPersefoni Raises $50 Million Series C-1 Funding And Doubles Down On AI\nPersefoni, a US-based climate software vendor, has recently announced both the launch of its latest AI product (PersefoniGPT) and a $50 million funding round. This follows several previous funding rounds, including $101 million Series B funding in 2021, and brings the total amount of investment to almost $165 million. The latest funding round was led by TPG Rise, with additional investment from Alumni Ventures, Bain and Co., Clearvision Ventures, EDF, ENEOS Innovation Partners, NGP Energy Technology Partners, Prelude Ventures, Parkway Ventures and Rise Investment Group.\nThis funding follows other VC investments in carbon management software, such as Watershed\u2019s $55 million Series B funding round in June and nZero\u2019s $16 million Series A funding round in April. Verdantix forecasts that the carbon management software market will grow to almost $1.5 billion by 2027, driven by increasingly rigorous regulations, ambitious plans for monitoring and managing net zero strategies, and increased participation in voluntary carbon markets (see Verdantix Market Size And Forecast: Carbon Management Software 2021-2027 (Global)).\nThis fundraising also signifies a vote of confidence in the role that AI will play in carbon emissions management. Automation is a crucial tool in reducing the technical and logistical challenges that arise when gathering, transforming and analysing vast quantities of dispersed data. These challenges are often most apparent in Scope 3 emissions management. Many platforms already use supervised machine learning for data standardization, data quality control, emissions factor allocation and emissions abatement initiative identification. Additionally, Norwegian vendor Position Green uses generative AI capabilities to provide basic descriptive data analysis.\nSince being founded in 2020, Persefoni has demonstrated a unique focus on AI, both incorporating as \u2018Persefoni AI Inc.\u2019 and appointing co-founder Kim Stroh as Head of AI. Since 2022, AI has become an increasingly prominent element of Persefoni\u2019s product offering. In April 2023, an initial model to help users map data types was supplemented with the arrival of Persefoni AI, offering capabilities that enabled automated anomaly and error detection and resolution, and suggestive emission factor allocation (see Persefoni Improves Data Accuracy With New AI Functionality For Carbon Management).\nThe latest release, PersefoniGPT, expands the current AI portfolio into generative capabilities, acting as a co-pilot product to support and educate Persefoni clients. Functions include guidance on regulation, management processes and platform features, intelligent alerts, a chat function, and suggestive analytical decision-making. This will aid in bridging the widening knowledge gap that is emerging as corporates are required to take on increasingly complex emissions-related responsibilities.\nAlastair is an Analyst in the Verdantix Net Zero & Climate Risk practice. His current research agenda focuses on carbon management software and decarbonization best practices, particularly those relating to Scope 3 and industrial emissions. Prior to joining Verdantix, Alastair worked at Tyler Grange, where he gained experience in consultancy practices and environmental strategy.

LG says they expect it out later this year, but there is no word yet on pricing.\nNot to be outdone, Samsung also teased the \u201cworld\u2019s first transparent MicroLED display,\u201d but it seems a bit further out from hitting the consumer market.\u00a0Two of the demo units had tinted glass, while a third looked totally clear in its frameless display.\nThe Samsung set I spent even more time checking out, though, is their new\u00a0flagship 65-inch QN900D Class Neo QLED 8K set\u00a0with brilliant picture quality and mind-blowing sound that the company says is thanks to the latest AI Gen 3 processors tucked inside.\nSamsung also says it\u2019s the \u201cslimmest, most premium 8K TV to ever hit the market,\u201d\u00a0delivering\u00a0enhanced 8K upscaling and promising to sharpen low-resolution content to \u201cOMG \u2014\u00a0I feel I'm right there in real life\u201d \u2014 ultra-high resolution. One example? It automatically detects the type of sport you\u2019re watching and uses deep learning to help you track the specific kind of ball on the screen with \u201ccrystal clarity.\u201d There is no word yet on pricing or release date.\nThese Robot Shoes Are Made for Walking \u2026 Really Fast\nStrapping on a pair of\u00a0Shift Robotics Moonwalkers X\u00a0new robotic \u201cAI Informed\u201d shoes felt like taking a step into the future. They look kind of like super high-tech roller skates, but each magnesium platform that you Velcro your own shoes onto has it\u2019s an operating system that controls a drive train. The smart shoes communicate with each other to keep you steady and sailing ahead \u2014 up to 7MPH \u2014 or about 3 times faster than normal.\nYou don\u2019t skate. You don\u2019t glide. You don\u2019t do anything except walk, heel-to-toe. There\u2019s no real learning curve. To speed up, you just take a bigger stride. To slow down or stop, you just \u2026 slow down or stop. On-board regenerative brakes slow you down and bring you to a smooth standstill, similar to how the brakes work on most electric vehicles.\nEach \u201cshoe\u201d weighs about four pounds, so they\u2019re heavy, but they make you move so much faster that you end up taking fewer steps overall. A company spokesperson says this is a big deal for the 6 million people who work in warehouses and distribution centers in the U.S.\nShift Robotics has been testing robot shoes at IKEA\u2019s flagship store in Sweden and says they\u2019ve helped boost productivity by around 250% in some cases. People who normally walk about 30,000 steps per day have been able to do the same amount of work even faster, with just 1,300 \u201cskeps.\u201d (I just made that word up - it\u2019s skate+steps, and I think it should be what we call this new mode of techy- movement.) I can also see this for end-point commutes or even the e-bike crowd, who feel the need for easier speed.\nThe company has not announced the price yet, but they expect to ship Moonwalkers X before July of this year.\nUp, Up, but Not Too Far E-Way\nElectric vehicles are back in full fleet this CES, including the new\u00a0Helix ultralight eVTOL from Pivotal. It\u2019s a fully carbon-fiber, 348-pound \u201calmost\u201d flying car concept, but without wheels. It takes off vertically, like a helicopter, and can fly for about 20 minutes or 20 miles at speeds around 60mph. It soars to altitudes between 400 and 1,200 feet, and you don\u2019t need a pilot\u2019s certificate to fly it, but the company does train you extensively before take off.\nWho might buy this kind of futuristic flying machine? The company says ranchers, aviation pioneers, former pilots, adventure-seekers, and Silicon Valley types who can afford six figures for that last leg of their commute are among the people pre-ordering it. A $250 deposit gets you in, but the actual price tag starts around $190,000.\nWe\u2019re about to go play with some cute little robots from Samsung and LG, and will have a whole lot more to show off from the Super Bowl of consumer tech. Be sure to keep checking back here for the very latest."

        "raw_content": "Biggest Trends of CES 2024: AI, Transparent Screens and Off-Grid Tech to Power Your Home\nThe trends emerging from the Las Vegas tech show are setting the tone for the year to come.\nAI is one of the most persistent themes at CES 2024.\nThere's an element of predictability when it comes to what we'll see every year at the Las Vegas tech bonanza CES. Big TVs? Tick. Home robots that never go on sale? Tick. An unnecessarily overdesigned toothbrush? Tick.\nEvery CES also brings its standout trends that dominate the big, flashy press conferences, the show floor and the late-night chatter at casino bars. Some of the biggest trends at this week's CES 2024 were easy to foresee; a massive emphasis on AI, for example. Others, such as transparent screens and new solutions to take your house off the grid, were only discernible once we'd scoured the show floors of the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nHere are our key takeaways, distilled for you based on everything CNET's editors have seen, tested and played with.\nAI in everything\nYou have about as much chance of winning at the slot machines as finding a company that doesn't boast of its AI prowess at CES 2024. This is far from the first time AI-powered products could be found amid the booths, but this is truly the year that AI is dominating the show.\nRead more: The Most Captivating Tech at CES 2024\nThe way it's showing up, says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee, is \"a layer of intelligence that sits atop a traditional product or service to enhance the customer experience.\" He points to products such as bird feeders to identify birds and pillows that adjust to reduce snoring as key examples.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nWhat we're witnessing right now is the integration of major breakthroughs in AI that have occurred in the past year or so -- such as OpenAI's ChatGPT -- into devices. \"There's no question that AI -- specifically generative AI -- is going to be a big driver of new products and services,\" says CNET's AI guru Connie Guglielmo.\nGuglielmo highlights Microsoft's decision to change up the Windows keyboard for the first time in nearly 30 years, adding a button that provides a direct link to launch its AI Copilot, as a key example. Another is\u00a0Volkswagen adding ChatGPT as a standard feature in its vehicles later this year. \"You can literally talk your car in a Knight Rider kind of way,\" she says.\nAlong with the AI products we've experienced firsthand, companies are dropping hints left, right and center at CES about what we can expect to see from them in the year ahead. In an\u00a0interview with CNET Senior Editor Lisa Eadicicco, Google's Sameer Samat, general manager and vice president of Android, Google Play and Wear OS, said that AI will play a key role in the evolution of how we interact with our phones.\nThat supports Guglielmo's take that \"we're just starting to see how this foundational tech is going to change the way we work, live and engage with the world.\"\nWe're already curious to see how this rapidly evolving technology will have changed the game again by the time CES 2025 rolls around.\nThe VW Golf will get chatbot technology from Cerence and OpenAI.\nThe screen, reinvented\nScreen technology is always a big deal at CES and this year is no exception, with exciting display advancements seen in everything from massive TVs to concept bendable phones. As CNET's TV expert David Katzmaier puts it, \"TVs are even bigger and brighter this year. Hisense and TCL, both made their mini-LED lineups twice as bright for the same money as last year, and both introduced huge, expensive models with eye-watering specifications at 110 and 115 inches.\"\nNeither model has been priced yet, but they're expected to cost many thousands of dollars. New screen tech never comes cheap, and nowhere is that more obvious than in C Seed's wild, folding N1, which splits its 137-inch display into five sections to neatly fold away -- and which comes with an astonishing $200,000 price tag. What cost-of-living crisis?\nCrazy displays for days.\n\"A new trend this year is transparent displays\" Katzmaier says. \"LG has made transparent OLED screens for the last few years for businesses, but its newest model will go on sale later this year for consumers.\"\nThe idea behind that new model, the OLED T, is to allow a screen to blend more seamlessly into the surrounding room when it's not in use, rather than simply being a gigantic black rectangle. When not in use, the display looks more like a window, with fish, stars or other objects dancing across the glass and a black film rising to cover the rear when you want it to function as a regular TV. As Katzmaier puts it: \"It's one of the coolest TVs I've ever seen.\"\nNot one to let LG have all the fun, Samsung showed off its own transparent display technology using micro-LEDs which look brighter and more colorful than OLED screens. While the demo was cool, it's more likely we'll see Samsung's see-through screen in commercial applications in the near future, rather than for your next TV.\nSamsung showed off new screen tech for its phones, too. Its Flex In & Out Flip concept caught Eadicicco's eye. \"The concept is a Z Flip-style phone that can bend both ways,\" she says. \"With a device like this, you'd be able to use the screen whether the device is opened or closed, potentially making your phone much easier to use in one hand.\"\nTerrible product name aside, the Flex In & Out Flip shows that companies like Samsung --\nalong with Motorola and its awesome rollable phone concept shown last year -- aren't ready to settle on one folding phone design just yet.\nNext-gen gaming technology\nGaming tech remains a staple of the show floor at this year's CES. New Intel 14th-gen mobile chips were found inside new laptops from Alienware, Lenovo, Asus, Razer and others along with expected updates across the board for higher performance. Many products, including HP's new Omen, are eschewing the typical \"battlestar\" aesthetic of many legacy gaming machines, instead giving options for those of us wanting a \"one size fits all\" machine for working during the day and fragging noobs at night.\nWe've also seen new graphics cards from Nvidia, vibrating gaming seats from Razer and refreshed gaming-focused phones from Asus.\nMSI's The Claw is one of the most powerful handheld game consoles yet.\nBut we've also been treated to the first handheld PC gaming console using Intel chips. Valve's SteamDeck gave us our first experience of playing PC games in a hand-held format when it launched back in 2022, and both Asus and Lenovo were quick to bring out their own versions. But while the models from Valve, Asus and Lenovo all use AMD processors, MSI's new Claw handheld packs Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 processors, which CNET Principal Writer Scott Stein reckons could make it the most powerful PC handheld around.\nWindows-based PC handhelds have been generally well received, allowing keen gamers to enjoy their polygon punching from the comfort of their couches without having to always fire up a gigantic, LED-strewn gaming rig. MSI's Intel-based model will bring a fresh injection of competition to the burgeoning category.\n\"What the Claw symbolizes may be even more important than what it does,\" Stein says. \"Intel is joining the party on new handheld-ready gaming chips, which suggests that hardware manufacturers should be even more able to create Steam Deck-like handhelds running Windows.\"\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nEnergy tech evolution\nAt previous editions of CES, the lack of home energy tech and serious solutions to help us tackle the environmental crisis has left us a little puzzled. There's no time like the present to right those wrongs and declare green technology a major trend of the show this year.\nOver the past few years, we've been buffeted by cost-of-living and environmental crises, amid skyrocketing energy prices, a greater need for more sophisticated heating and cooling tech, pressure on the electrical grid and waves of power outages. Smart homeowners everywhere are more aware that they need to take their energy management into their own hands, and CES 2024 has shown us how tech companies are responding.\nProducts such as a portable, whole-home backup battery from EcoFlow and new solar technology in the form of electricity-generating stained glass are just some of the innovations in energy technology. Meanwhile, our road to increasing self-reliance is being paved with things like\u00a0moisture-farming tech that can generate water from thin air and smart energy services that let you switch between on-grid and off-grid energy sources with a single button.\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nAre the products at CES 2024 enough to make a serious statement about the tech industry's commitment to sustainability? No. But as Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson said ahead of the show, it's \"a small step in the right direction.\"\n\"The next stage would be to embed sustainability and circular economy principles into the very design of new technology and product offerings,\" he added.\nIn the meantime, the new technologies we've seen this year can help us imagine what a livable future looks like as the realities of climate change, particularly extreme weather, continue to set in.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"
