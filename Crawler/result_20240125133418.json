        "raw_content": "Suche\nCES 2024: Bosch technologies help consumers\nuse energy sustainably\nTim Wieland\n>\nLas Vegas, NV, USA \u2013 Whether on the road or in the home, Bosch is driving forward the electrification of its technologies and solutions for sustainable energy use, and sees hydrogen as a key to meeting the world\u2019s energy needs in a climate-neutral way. At the CES 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, the company is presenting technology and applications that can not only make life easier, safer, and more convenient, but also more sustainable \u2013 all for the good of our planet. Global energy consumption has doubled in the past 50 years \u2013 and continues to grow by around 2 percent each year . Fossil fuels currently account for some 80 percent of global energy consumption. In view of climate change, this is a major challenge.\n\u201cTo help us meet our future global energy needs in a more resource-efficient way, we at Bosch are rethinking energy use and focusing on a two-pronged approach: electrification and hydrogen. For a low-emissions future, we are optimizing the use of traditional energy sources by driving forward electrification in mobility, commercial buildings, and homes. And we are tapping into new, sustainable energy sources \u2013 with hydrogen playing a central role,\u201d said Tanja R\u00fcckert, member of the board of management of Robert Bosch GmbH, at CES 2024 in Las Vegas.\nMore efficient electrification thanks to innovative Bosch technologies\nElectrification is already well advanced, particularly in the mobility sector. Bosch is a leading supplier along the entire electromobility value chain \u2013 from chips,\ne-axles, and electric motors to battery technology, charging stations, and numerous services. One innovation the company is presenting at CES has been named a CES\u00ae 2024 Innovation Award honoree by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA): automated valet charging. In a parking garage equipped with an automated valet parking system (automated valet parking), electric cars featuring this new technology can drive themselves to an available parking space furnished with a charging spot. At the touch of a button on a smartphone, a robot charges the battery without any further human intervention. Once charging is complete, the vehicle maneuvers driverlessly to another parking space, leaving the spot free for the next car. \u201cThe unique combination of automated valet charging and automated valet parking makes Bosch a pioneer on the market,\u201d R\u00fcckert said, adding: \u201cEvery step toward greater convenience in electromobility increases not only its attractiveness but also its acceptance.\u201d\nThis is another reason why Bosch is focusing on the innovative semiconductor material silicon carbide (SiC), a key component for electrified mobility. The ramp-up of electromobility worldwide is leading to enormous demand for these special semiconductors. Using highly complex processes it developed itself, Bosch has been producing SiC chips at its wafer fab in Reutlingen, Germany, since 2021, and is currently investing more than 1.5 billion dollars in a further wafer fab in Roseville, California. This move will strengthen the company\u2019s international semiconductor manufacturing network. The aim is to start production of the first SiC chips in the U.S. by 2026, and in doing so increase the company\u2019s output tenfold in the years ahead. In electric cars, SiC chips extend driving range and make charging more efficient, as their energy losses are up to 50 percent lower. They also enable the car to travel further on a single battery charge \u2013 on average, range is up to 6 percent greater than with silicon-based chips.\nHeat pumps optimize energy consumption in homes\nAnother Bosch highlight at CES 2024 is the IDS Ultra Heat Pump, which was developed specifically for North America. Unlike conventional models, this heat pump provides 100 percent heating capacity down to outdoor temperatures of 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 degrees Celsius), and it\u2019s operational down to as low as minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 25 degrees Celsius). This is a particularly attractive option for people in colder climates in the U.S. or Canada looking to switch from fossil fuel-based heating systems to electrified alternatives. Such a switch saves not only energy but also costs: Bosch heat pumps are three to five times more energy efficient than gas furnaces and consume only about half as much electricity as electric furnaces. Bosch has also succeeded in applying heat-pump technology to a different area: in Las Vegas, the company is presenting its most efficient water heater to date, which is a hybrid of an electric storage water heater and a heat pump that is three to four times more efficient than traditional water heaters in the market. \u201cWith solutions like this, we are paving the way to an electrified home \u2013 and helping save costs and energy,\u201d says Mike Mansuetti, president of Bosch in North America.\nVarious new features in Bosch home appliances such as ovens, dryers, and washing machines are also playing their part in this transition. For some time now, it has been common for users to set the start time for their appliance using a timer function. Bosch is now going one step further and equipping its latest generation of dishwashers with its \u201cMySchedule\u201d function for the first time. This can automatically schedule the start of the wash cycle to coincide with the periods when either the electricity price is lowest or green electricity is available. Good news for professional power tool users, too: at CES 2024, Bosch has announced further new partners for its AMPShare power tool battery platform \u2013 more than 30 global partners are now on board. Bosch AMPShare is a cross-brand battery system that allows trade and industry professionals to switch flexibly between different brands of professional tools without having to exchange the battery.\nBosch is actively promoting hydrogen as a pillar of future mobility\nIn addition to electrification, Bosch sees hydrogen as a key to meeting global energy demand in a resource-efficient way. As a storage medium, moreover, hydrogen can facilitate the efficient use of energy generated from renewable sources. Bosch is investing extensively in technologies along the hydrogen value chain. The focus is currently on the mobile fuel cell, which recently went into volume production in Stuttgart. This lies at the heart of the powertrain system for heavy vehicles. Bosch has already received its first orders from truck manufacturers in Europe, the U.S., and China. The company is also working on components for a hydrogen engine, which converts fuel directly into energy without first converting it into electricity. When powered by green hydrogen, this engine is practically carbon neutral. The H2 engine is due to debut this year. Countries and industries around the world are investing in hydrogen technologies. The U.S. government, for example, is pushing ahead with the development of H2 infrastructure and investing 7 billion dollars in the construction of hydrogen hubs. \u201cThe H2 hubs are an important building block for establishing a hydrogen infrastructure. We at Bosch support these measures and are exploring participation in several of these hubs. Our goal is to help drive forward the clean-energy economy in North America. This is an area where we can contribute our expertise in the production and provisioning of hydrogen,\u201d Mansuetti says.\nSoftware paves the way for greater convenience and energy efficiency\nAcross all its divisions, Bosch is focusing on the use of software and digitalization. The company now has more than 44,000 associates working in software development, and it sees itself as leading the way to software-defined mobility. In Las Vegas, Bosch is presenting new products and solutions together with its strategic partner Amazon Web Services. These include a connected, fully automatic espresso machine, which will also be possible to control from the car using voice assistance such as Alexa, and a point-of-interest assistant, which uses an interior camera in the vehicle to recognize which restaurant or caf\u00e9 the driver is looking at based on their eye movements. The voice assistance then informs the driver in real time and completely automatically whether the restaurant is open and has a free table available.\nBosch is also presenting two new mobility services at the electronics trade fair: Usage Certificate To Go and Vehicle Health Service. The first is an addition to Bosch\u2019s already established Battery in the Cloud services. The feature analyzes battery data, determines the battery\u2019s condition, and helps extend its service life by up to 20 percent through optimization. The second service, aimed at fleet operators, offers features designed above all to prevent vehicle breakdowns. Both innovations aim to extend the service life of vehicles and conserve resources. Bosch is taking a similar approach in the building sector: The company offers digital services to achieve efficiency gains, such as the \"Nexospace Energy Manager\" for the European market. This helps customers to analyze their energy supply and usage and develop specific measures to optimize and reduce consumption. This was the case with the international supermarket chain REWE, for example, which was able to reduce consumption by up to 20 percent in more than 2,000 stores with the help of the \u201cNexospace Energy Manager\u201d. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, Bosch services can help save considerable amounts of CO2 by increasing efficiency. Decarbonize Industries, an AI-supported software-based service developed by Bosch together with a partner, helps manufacturing companies reduce their carbon footprint and also achieve significant cost savings.\nAutomated Valet Charging\nManufacturing of the Fuel Cell Power Module (FCPM) in the Feuerbach plant\nPower semiconductors from Bosch\nMySchedule App 800 Home Connect\nAutomated Valet Charging\nKey Visual Leit-PI\nBosch's cold climate heat pump IDS Ultra\nAutomated Valet Charging\nManufacturing of the Fuel Cell Power Module (FCPM) in the Feuerbach plant\nPower semiconductors from Bosch\nMySchedule App 800 Home Connect\nAutomated Valet Charging\nKey Visual Leit-PI\nBosch's cold climate heat pump IDS Ultra\nBosch at CES 2024:\n\u2022 PRESS CONFERENCE: Monday, January 8, 2024, from 9:00 to 9:45 a.m. (PST) with Dr. Tanja R\u00fcckert, member of the board of management of\nRobert Bosch GmbH, and Mike Mansuetti, president of Bosch in North America, in Ballroom Banyan ABCD, Mandalay Bay Hotel, Las Vegas,\nSouth Convention Center, Level 3, as well as livestreamed on the Bosch Media Service.\n\u2022 BOOTH: January 9 \u2013 12, 2024, in the Central Hall, booth #17207.\n\u2022 FOLLOW the Bosch CES 2024 highlights on X: #BoschCES.\n\u2022 PANELS WITH BOSCH EXPERTS, Thursday, January 11, 2024:\n\u201cElevate Your Space: Enhancing your Home with Smart Appliances\u201d, 15:00 p.m. (local time), Venetian Hotel, Lando 4302, session with\nGoncalo Costa, Vice President of Climate and Wellbeing North America.\n\u201cOur Newest Cyber Threat is AI and AI is Our Biggest Defense\u201d,\n14:00 p.m. (local time), Las Vegas Convention Center West / N258,\nsession with Dr. Zico Kolter, Chief Scientist of AI at Bosch.\n\u201cFuture of Care: How Other Industries Shape Health\u201d, 11:00 a.m.\n(local time), Las Vegas Convention Center / North Wing, session with\nDr. Stefan Finkbeiner, General Manager at Bosch Sensortec.\nTags:\nSustainability\nContact persons for press inquiries:\nBosch at CES:\nIrina Ananyeva: +49 152 597-53284\nTim Wieland: +1 248 410-0288\nTrix B\u00f6hne: +49 173 523-9774\nConnected mobility, software: Athanassios Kaliudis: +49 152 086-51292\nSmart living: D\u00f6rthe Warnk: +49 172 153-8714\nHydrogen: Anna Schmatz: +49 173 409-7533\nAutomated mobility: Jennifer Gass: +49 152 346-63461\nSustainability: Inga Ehret:, +49 172 324-2636\nX: @BoschPress\nHaving established a regional presence in 1906 in North America, the Bosch Group employs 34,700 associates in more than 100 locations, as of December 31, 2020.

        "raw_content": "Bosch Tackles EVs and Efficiency at CES 2024\nJoin our Engineering Community! Sign-in with:\nBosch Tackles EVs and Efficiency at CES 2024\nBosch demonstrated a variety of new initiatives for a sustainable future. EEPower reports from CES 2024 in this roundup of Bosch\u2019s innovations.\nEvery year, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) acts as the industry\u2019s launching pad for new technologies and next-generation concepts. Fortunately, CES 2024 was no exception, as many of the industry\u2019s biggest names, including Bosch, demonstrated the latest and greatest in consumer electronics.\nA particular focus of this year\u2019s show was sustainability, with the floor being dominated by electric vehicles (EVs) and more efficient power solutions. Bosch used the opportunity to launch a variety of sustainability-focused initiatives, one of which won a CES Innovation Award.\nBosch and VW Team Up for Automated EV Parking\nBosch and Volkswagen subsidiary Cariad are collaborating in the testing of automated valet charging.\nBuilt upon Bosch's automated valet parking system, the solution allows EVs to autonomously navigate to an available parking space equipped with a charging spot. A charging robot then connects to the vehicle to begin charging. Once fully charged, the vehicle moves to a regular parking spot, making the charging spot available for other EVs.\nThis technology addresses common challenges EV drivers face, such as long queues at charging stations and the inconvenience of manual charging. Additionally, automated valet charging can potentially optimize the efficiency of charging infrastructure and parking space utilization by automating it through a robotic system.\nThe technology won a CES Innovation Award, and currently, testing trials are being conducted in Bosch's development parking garage in Ludwigsburg and Cariad's staff parking garage in Ingolstadt, Germany.\nBosch Tackles Efficiency\nBeyond automatic valets, Bosch used CES 2024 to showcase its commitment to sustainable energy use through a series of technological innovations focused on digitalization, electrification, and hydrogen.\nFirst, Bosch is making strides in the semiconductor industry by producing silicon carbide (SiC) chips for EVs, which are more efficient than traditional silicon chips. In fact, the company is investing $1.5 billion into a SiC wafer fab in California with the hopes of starting SiC production in the U.S. by 2026.\nNext, Bosch highlighted their new IDS Ultra Heat Pump for the home. Designed for North American climates, the fully electric pump provides 100% heating capacity down to 5\u00b0F. This was coupled with their demonstration of an electric storage water heater solution Bosch claims is up to four times more efficient than traditional water heaters.\nFurther, Bosch is investing heavily in hydrogen technologies, emphasizing its role in future mobility and energy efficiency. The company has already started volume production of mobile fuel cells and is developing components for a hydrogen engine, which promises nearly carbon-neutral operation when powered by green hydrogen. The company has invested $7 billion into hydrogen hubs to support this effort.\nAdvancing Sustainable, Energy-Efficient Solutions\nOverall, Bosch's presentations at CES 2024 highlight its dedication to advancing sustainable, efficient energy solutions across various sectors, including mobility, home appliances, and industrial technologies. Developments like these will be necessary to achieve a cleaner, more sustainable future.\nRelated Content\nLearn More About:\nYou May Also Like\nby Steve Roberts\nby Shannon Cuthrell\nby Shannon Cuthrell\nby Lorenzo Mari\nby Shannon Cuthrell\nWelcome Back\nDon't have an EEPower account?

At the CES 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, the company is presenting technology and applications that can not only make life easier, safer, and more convenient, but also more sustainable \u2013 all for the good of our planet. Global energy consumption has doubled in the past 50 years \u2013 and continues to grow by around 2 percent each year1. Fossil fuels currently account for some 80 percent of global energy consumption. In view of climate change, this is a major challenge.\n\"To help us meet our future global energy needs in a more resource-efficient way, we at Bosch are rethinking energy use and focusing on a two-pronged approach: electrification and hydrogen. For a low-emissions future, we are optimizing the use of traditional energy sources by driving forward electrification in mobility, commercial buildings, and homes. And we are tapping into new, sustainable energy sources \u2013 with hydrogen playing a central role,\" said Tanja R\u00fcckert, member of the board of management of Robert Bosch GmbH, at CES 2024 in Las Vegas.\nMore efficient electrification thanks to innovative Bosch technologies\nElectrification is already well advanced, particularly in the mobility sector. Bosch is a leading supplier along the entire electromobility value chain \u2013 from chips, e-axles, and electric motors to battery technology, charging stations, and numerous services. One innovation the company is presenting at CES has been named a CES\u00ae 2024 Innovation Award honoree by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA): automated valet charging. In a parking garage equipped with an automated valet parking system (automated valet parking), electric cars featuring this new technology can drive themselves to an available parking space furnished with a charging spot. At the touch of a button on a smartphone, a robot charges the battery without any further human intervention. Once charging is complete, the vehicle maneuvers driverlessly to another parking space, leaving the spot free for the next car. \"The unique combination of automated valet charging and automated valet parking makes Bosch a pioneer on the market,\" R\u00fcckert said, adding: \"Every step toward greater convenience in electromobility increases not only its attractiveness but also its acceptance.\"\nThis is another reason why Bosch is focusing on the innovative semiconductor material silicon carbide (SiC), a key component for electrified mobility. The ramp-up of electromobility worldwide is leading to enormous demand for these special semiconductors. Using highly complex processes it developed itself, Bosch has been producing SiC chips at its wafer fab in Reutlingen, Germany, since 2021, and is currently investing more than 1.5 billion dollars in a further wafer fab in Roseville, California. This move will strengthen the company\u2019s international semiconductor manufacturing network. The aim is to start production of the first SiC chips in the U.S. by 2026, and in doing so increase the company\u2019s output tenfold in the years ahead. In electric cars, SiC chips extend driving range and make charging more efficient, as their energy losses are up to 50 percent lower. They also enable the car to travel further on a single battery charge \u2013 on average, range is up to 6 percent greater than with silicon-based chips.\nHeat pumps optimize energy consumption in homes\nAnother Bosch highlight at CES 2024 is the IDS Ultra Heat Pump, which was developed specifically for North America. Unlike conventional models, this heat pump provides 100 percent heating capacity down to outdoor temperatures of 5 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 degrees Celsius), and it\u2019s operational down to as low as minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 25 degrees Celsius). This is a particularly attractive option for people in colder climates in the U.S. or Canada looking to switch from fossil fuel-based heating systems to electrified alternatives. Such a switch saves not only energy but also costs. Bosch has also succeeded in applying heat-pump technology to a different area: in Las Vegas, the company is presenting its most efficient water heater to date, which is a hybrid of an electric storage water heater and a heat pump that is three to four times more efficient than traditional water heaters in the market. \"With solutions like this, we are paving the way to an electrified home \u2013 and helping save costs and energy,\" says Mike Mansuetti, president of Bosch in North America.\nVarious new features in Bosch home appliances such as ovens, dryers, and washing machines are also playing their part in this transition. For some time now, it has been common for users to set the start time for their appliance using a timer function. Bosch is now going one step further and equipping its latest generation of dishwashers with its \"MySchedule\" function for the first time. This can automatically schedule the start of the wash cycle to coincide with the periods when either the electricity price is lowest or green electricity is available. Good news for professional power tool users, too: at CES 2024, Bosch has announced further new partners for its AMPShare power tool battery platform \u2013 more than 30 global partners are now on board. Bosch AMPShare is a cross-brand battery system that allows trade and industry professionals to switch flexibly between different brands of professional tools without having to exchange the battery.\nBosch is actively promoting hydrogen as a pillar of future mobility\nIn addition to electrification, Bosch sees hydrogen as a key to meeting global energy demand in a resource-efficient way. As a storage medium, moreover, hydrogen can facilitate the efficient use of energy generated from renewable sources. Bosch is investing extensively in technologies along the hydrogen value chain. The focus is currently on the mobile fuel cell, which recently went into volume production in Stuttgart. This lies at the heart of the powertrain system for heavy vehicles. Bosch has already received its first orders from truck manufacturers in Europe, the U.S., and China. The company is also working on components for a hydrogen engine, which converts fuel directly into energy without first converting it into electricity. When powered by green hydrogen, this engine is practically carbon neutral. The H2 engine is due to debut this year. Countries and industries around the world are investing in hydrogen technologies. The U.S. government, for example, is pushing ahead with the development of H2 infrastructure and investing 7 billion dollars in the construction of hydrogen hubs. \"The H2 hubs are an important building block for establishing a hydrogen infrastructure. We at Bosch support these measures and are exploring participation in several of these hubs. Our goal is to help drive forward the clean-energy economy in North America. This is an area where we can contribute our expertise in the production and provisioning of hydrogen,\" Mansuetti says.\nSoftware paves the way for greater convenience and energy efficiency\nAcross all its divisions, Bosch is focusing on the use of software and digitalization. The company now has more than 44,000 associates working in software development, and it sees itself as leading the way to software-defined mobility. In Las Vegas, Bosch is presenting new products and solutions together with its strategic partner Amazon Web Services. These include a connected, fully automatic espresso machine, which will also be possible to control from the car using voice assistance such as Alexa, and a point-of-interest assistant, which uses an interior camera in the vehicle to recognize which restaurant or caf\u00e9 the driver is looking at based on their eye movements. The voice assistance then informs the driver in real time and completely automatically whether the restaurant is open and has a free table available.\nBosch is also presenting two new mobility services at the electronics trade fair: Usage Certificate To Go and Vehicle Health Service. The first is an addition to Bosch\u2019s already established Battery in the Cloud services. The feature analyzes battery data, determines the battery\u2019s condition, and helps extend its service life by up to 20 percent through optimization. The second service, aimed at fleet operators, offers features designed above all to prevent vehicle breakdowns. Both innovations aim to extend the service life of vehicles and conserve resources. Bosch is taking a similar approach in the building sector: The company offers digital services to achieve efficiency gains, such as the \"Nexospace Energy Manager\" for the European market. This helps customers to analyze their energy supply and usage and develop specific measures to optimize and reduce consumption. This was the case with the international supermarket chain REWE, for example, which was able to reduce consumption by up to 20 percent in more than 2,000 stores with the help of the \"Nexospace Energy Manager\". Meanwhile, in manufacturing, Bosch services can help save considerable amounts of CO2 by increasing efficiency. Decarbonize Industries, an AI-supported software-based service developed by Bosch together with a partner, helps manufacturing companies reduce their carbon footprint and also achieve significant cost savings.\nPress photos: #d83ba8f9, #791bbe41, #de5f902d, #f7120c34, #d00f7b3b, #e7214774, #f0e0d409\nBosch at CES 2024:\nPRESS CONFERENCE: Monday, January 8, 2024, from 9:00 to 9:45 a.m. (PST) with Dr. Tanja R\u00fcckert, member of the board of management of Robert Bosch GmbH, and Mike Mansuetti, president of Bosch in North America, in Ballroom Banyan ABCD, Mandalay Bay Hotel, Las Vegas, South Convention Center, Level 3, as well as livestreamed on the Bosch Media Service.\nBOOTH: January 9 \u2013 12, 2024, in the Central Hall, booth #17207.\nFOLLOW the Bosch CES 2024 highlights on X: #BoschCES.\nPANELS WITH BOSCH EXPERTS, Thursday, January 11, 2024:\"Elevate Your Space: Enhancing your Home with Smart Appliances\", 15:00 p.m. (local time), Venetian Hotel, Lando 4302, session with Goncalo Costa, Vice President of Climate and Wellbeing North America.\"Our Newest Cyber Threat is AI and AI is Our Biggest Defense\", 14:00 p.m. (local time), Las Vegas Convention Center West / N258, session with Dr. Zico Kolter, Chief Scientist of AI at Bosch.\"Future of Care: How Other Industries Shape Health\", 11:00 a.m. (local time), Las Vegas Convention Center / North Wing, session with Dr. Stefan Finkbeiner, General Manager at Bosch Sensortec.\nHaving established a presence in North America in 1906, today the Bosch Group employs 37,000 associates in more than 100 locations in the region (as of Dec. 31, 2022).
