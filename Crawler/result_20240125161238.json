Their exceptional product innovations have garnered international acclaim, leading the way in tech trends and solidifying local R&D capabilities.\nBoth award-winning companies are graduates from HKSTP\u2019s Incubation and Acceleration Programmes. AI Guided Limited\u2019s \"GUIDi\u2122 Smart Belt\" won in the \"Accessibility and Aging Tech\" category. This smart belt uses MEMS and AI technologies to provide real-time, comprehensive navigation and route guidance for visually impaired individuals, enhancing their safety and independence while travelling. The \"0.13\" micro-LED Display Module\" by Sitan Semiconductor International Co Limited, notable for its ultra-high pixel density (10,000 ppi), won in the \"XR Technologies and Accessories\" category, offering AR/XR products a display option that boasts high brightness, long lifetime, and high efficiency.\nThe CES Innovation Awards represents the highest distinction at CES, recognising products that demonstrate unparalleled innovation over the past year. These products are evaluated based on their engineering quality, aesthetics, design, practical value, uniqueness, and their impact on improving quality of life.\nIr Dr HL Yiu, Chief Corporate Development Officer of HKSTP, inspired by the Park companies\u2019 success, said, \u201cWe are thrilled to witness numerous Hong Kong tech ventures showcasing their latest products and solutions at this premier global exhibition and achieving outstanding results. This demonstrates the impressive R&D potential of Hong Kong\u2019s innovation and technology (I&T) sector. HKSTP remains steadfast in its mission to enhancing the local startup ecosystem and unlocking more market opportunities. We are dedicated to supporting tech ventures in their efforts to go global and attract foreign investment, driving Hong Kong\u2019s reputation as an international I&T hub.\u201d\nDr Steve Kong, co-founder and Chief Executive Officer of AI Guided Limited, said, \u201cDespite the rapid pace of technological advancement, the needs of the visually impaired community often remain overlooked by society. As I received education and grew up in Hong Kong, I am firmly committed to making Hong Kong the launchpad for our AI technology. With the recognition from the CES Innovation Awards, our goal is to elevate our independently developed products to the global arena, harnessing technology to deliver greater care and convenience to society.\u201d\nDr Zhaojun Liu, founder and Chief Executive Officer of Sitan Semiconductor International Co. Limited, said, \u201cAt Sitan, we have always been devoted to the advancement of micro-LED technology, working tirelessly to reach the pinnacle in ultimate display technology, with the aspiration to \u2018illuminate the world with our microchips\u2019. We are honoured that our 0.13-inch micro-LED display module has been recognised with the CES 2024 Innovation Award (XR Technologies and Accessories Category). Our gratitude goes to the HKSTP Incubation Programme for its unwavering support, which has been crucial in allowing us to demonstrate Hong Kong's exceptional scientific research achievements to the international community.\u201d\nThis year, HKSTP, will join forces with the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) and the Hong Kong Electronic Industries Association Ltd (HKEIA) to lead a contingent of 20 Hong Kong innovative technology enterprises in CES 2024, scheduled from 9 to 12 January 2024.
