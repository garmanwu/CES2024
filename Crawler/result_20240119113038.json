The one that we really like is a jaw flex because it's very subtle.\"\nThe founder of the start-up initially started the project to help a paralyzed friend play video games again, Alexander said.\nThe company is now looking for headphone manufacturers willing to integrate the technology into their products.\nMovie screen glasses\nOnly slightly bulkier than conventional eyewear, XREAL's augmented reality (AR) glasses project a movie theater-sized screen into thin air.\n\"Wear these on a flight, in a car, or on a train\u2014you're going to have a big screen experience that comes right out of your pocket,\" says Ralph Jodice, head of PR for the Chinese company.\n\"When you're sitting at your desk, whether it's in the office or at home, we can put three virtual screens floating out in space.\"\nSensors can also track hand movements, enabling the creation of virtual 3D applications.\nThe various models cost between $400 and $700.\nMuting masks\nWith the Skyted silent mask, you can finally make that important call in a train's quiet car.\nWearing the surgical mask-sized device, \"your voice doesn't go out and noise doesn't come in,\" explains Stephane Hersen, the French company's founder.\nThe sound-absorbing mask connects to telephones or computers, allowing users to make \"silent, confidential calls in any circumstance,\" says the former Airbus employee, highlighting noisy offices.\nHe says the company has a completely different outlook after the COVID-19 pandemic, which changed many peoples' perceptions of wearing masks.\n'Eyes' in the back of your head\nWhile working as a corrections officer, .simstechnology founder Sean Siembab says he was attacked from behind, suffering a traumatic brain injury.\nDuring his rehab, a bicyclist hit him\u2014from behind.\n\"At that point, I said 'there's got to be something out there that alerts you.'\"\nHe got to work developing an accessory worn on users' backs that warns them when someone approaches from behind. With a tiny camera, it also films the interaction.\nUsers then have the option of sending an SOS message from their phone or smartwatch.\nThe device is expected to retail for $199, with a $79 per year fee to store video footage in the cloud.\nSpeed-walking shoes\nWhy run when you can walk faster? Users wearing Shift Robotics' electric wheeled device\u2014over their shoes\u2014glide along without breaking a sweat.\n\"They are not (roller) skates\u2014they don't coast... If you stop walking, they don't move at all,\" explains Shift Robotics marketing director David Politis.\nHe says the latest version\u2014the Moonwalkers X\u2014are faster and lighter than their predecessor.\n\"Walking is fine, but there are certain instances where people walk a lot,\" says Politis, highlighting warehouses where employees are on their feet all day.\nTouting the device's benefits on productivity, he says that IKEA, which piloted the shoes in a store in Sweden, estimates that employees wearing the Moonwalkers could save \"nearly 400 hours a year.\"\nNo walking is needed for Skwheel's electric skis, however\u2014nor snow, for that matter.\nManufactured by a French start-up, the battery-powered skates seek to replicate the feeling of skiing, on or offroad.\nSome customers may use them for a fun daily commute, but the company also intends to sell them to winter sports stores for summer rentals.\n\u00a9 2024 AFP\nExplore further\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nFeedback to editors\n12 hours ago\n0\n12 hours ago\n0\n15 hours ago\n0\nJan 17, 2024\n0\nJan 17, 2024\n0\n6 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n10 hours ago\n11 hours ago\n12 hours ago\n12 hours ago\n12 hours ago\n15 hours ago\n18 hours ago\nRelated Stories\nJan 4, 2023\nJan 8, 2023\nJul 27, 2020\nDec 16, 2020\nJan 28, 2022\nJan 18, 2022\nRecommended for you\nJan 17, 2024\nJan 17, 2024\nJan 9, 2024\nDec 28, 2023\nDec 21, 2023\nDec 7, 2023\nUse this form if you have come across a typo, inaccuracy or would like to send an edit request for the content on this page.\nFor general inquiries, please use our\ncontact form.\nFor general feedback, use the public comments section below (please adhere to guidelines).\nPlease select the most appropriate category to facilitate processing of your request\nThank you for taking time to provide your feedback to the editors.\nYour feedback is important to us.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Wearable tech products stealing the show this year\nAs CES 2024 concludes for another year, it\u2019s an opportune moment to look back at the health and fitness gadgets that made their mark at the event in Las Vegas, which took place between January 9th and 12th.\nCES stands as the world\u2019s most significant and influential technology event. For tech aficionados, it\u2019s an unparalleled experience. Its closest counterpart is IFA, held annually in Berlin at the start of September.\nHistorically, these expos have been pivotal in introducing technologies we now consider commonplace. This year, Fitbit, Fossil, and Xiaomi disappointed with no new announcements. Consistent with previous years, Apple did not participate. Nevertheless, wearables maintained a strong presence in 2024.\nThe event sprawled across 2.75 million square feet, featuring over 2,000 exhibitors. These included manufacturers, developers, and suppliers of consumer technology hardware and content. The conference program boasted more than 1,000 speakers. It\u2019s estimated that over 100,000 attendees visited the event.\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of our top wearable tech picks from the Las Vegas showrooms. These are just a handful of our favorites. Our comprehensive coverage of CES 2024 can be found on this link.\nAmazfit Helio Ring\nOur top pick this year is the Amazfit Helio Ring, a product by Zepp Health, marking their first venture into the realm of smart rings. This device is specifically designed for athletes, focusing on optimizing recovery and enhancing performance. Unlike typical smart rings that mainly track sleep for the general public, the Helio Ring provides in-depth insights into both mental and physical conditions, a feature particularly beneficial for athletes.\nThe Helio Ring\u2019s standout feature is its ability to convert complex health data into a simple Readiness score. By monitoring sleep heart rate, HRV, breathing, and body temperature overnight, the ring, in conjunction with the Zepp App, calculates this score to help athletes decide whether to focus on training or recovery. This aids in planning workouts more effectively. The ring also offers comprehensive sleep and recovery tracking, including analysis of sleep quality, sleep stages, and sleep breathing quality. Additionally, it features EDA emotional monitoring, which assesses physical signs like hand sweat to indicate emotional stress.\nMind you, this is not the only smart ring which made its appearance. Also there were RingConn with their excellent offering, along with Evie Ring, Velia Ring, YogiFi Ring and Dcare Ring. Its shaping up to be an exciting year for smart rings!\nWithings BeamO\nNext up on our list is the Withings BeamO, a groundbreaking health monitoring device that combines the futuristic vision of Star Trek with practical technology. BeamO allows users to perform a 4-in-1 health checkup, including body temperature, heart, and lung health, in under a minute.\nBeamO, the world\u2019s 1st multiscope for revolutionary at-home checkups, was unveiled at #CES2024 \u2014 our booth has been packed with people and the awards just keep coming.If you couldn\u2019t make it to CES or get through the crowds, here\u2019s PM Livia Robic with a personal demo for you. pic.twitter.com/LqZrk9ljzO\nThe thing functions as a thermometer, ECG, oximeter, and stethoscope, using photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodes for accurate readings. BeamO also features a non-contact temperature sensor and a digital stethoscope with a Piezoelectric disc for detailed heart and lung assessments. The data syncs with the Withings Health app, providing insights and enabling telehealth consultations.\nPriced at $249.95 the device is set to be available in June 2024. BeamO is recognized as a CES Innovations Award Honoree and represents a significant advancement in home health monitoring technology.\nGarmin Lily 2\nAnother standout device from CES 2024 is the Garmin Lily 2, a successor to the original Garmin Lily launched in 2021. The Lily 2 retains the stylish and functional appeal of its predecessor but introduces several notable upgrades. It features an improved heart rate sensor, new fitness modes, and NFC payments.\nDesign-wise, the model retains a classic round shape, but the Lily 2 upgrades the build to anodized aluminum for enhanced durability and sophistication. The Lily 2 also simplifies band switching with a more standard lug design. As before, there\u2019s a TFT LCD with 16-level grayscale on-board. The Lily 2 stands out with its Gen 4 Elevate sensor, improving health and fitness tracking, and introduces NFC for contactless payments, a feature absent in the original Lily. Priced slightly higher than the original, the Lily 2 offers a blend of fashion, functionality, and fitness tracking, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a stylish, compact wearable.\nGarmin HRM-Fit\nAlso among our favorite picks from CES 2024 is the Garmin HRM-Fit, a heart rate monitor specifically designed for women. Priced at $150, it offers a snug fit and is compatible with medium to high support sports bras, accommodating a variety of body types. Its design ensures stability and comfort during intense workouts, although it\u2019s advised not to use it with certain types of bras like longline, front zip, and light support variants.\nFunctionally, the HRM-Fit excels in providing precise heart rate data, surpassing the accuracy of wrist-based devices. It supports advanced workout tracking, including metrics like vertical oscillations, ground contact time, and stride length, crucial for detailed running form analysis. With a battery life of up to one year (based on daily one-hour usage) and water resistance up to 50 feet, it\u2019s built for endurance and versatility.\nNowatch hybrid\nNowatch, a Dutch startup, has evolved from a mindful health tracker to a sophisticated hybrid smartwatch, showcased at CES 2024. The original Nowatch, known for its stress prediction using an electrodermal sensor (EDA), has now incorporated Chronos \u2018timepiece faces\u2019, adding the functionality of time display while maintaining its focus on mindfulness and stress awareness.\nThe AI Insights feature provides daily summaries and recommendations based on the wearer\u2019s stress data, sleep, and activity stats. The design of Nowatch, featuring interchangeable discs made of polished metal and gemstones, emphasizes wearability and style. This evolution marks Nowatch\u2019s journey in the wearable technology space, focusing on aesthetics, mindfulness, and a user-customizable experience.\nUltrahuman Home\nUltrahuman has introduced Ultrahuman Home at CES 2024, a device that tracks and enhances the health of living spaces. This innovative product extends Ultrahuman\u2019s wearable tech expertise to environmental health monitoring. It provides insights into factors like artificial light, air quality, humidity, and noise levels, correlating them with individual lifestyle factors such as sleep and stress.\nIntroducing Ultrahuman Home! It is a sleek yet powerful device that will provide insights on an individual's external environment including exposure to artificial light, air quality, humidity and noise levels. It\u2019s a first for the wearable space to leverage home health data and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SV33UHFp2q\nUltrahuman Home offers a longitudinal view of environmental markers and their impact on health over time, featuring capabilities like natural light spectrum monitoring, PM detection, noise detection, humidity level monitoring, and blue light exposure monitoring. Set to launch on Kickstarter for USD $349, Ultrahuman Home represents a novel approach to integrating personal and environmental health monitoring.\nMomentum Sport Earbuds\nThe Sennheiser Momentum Sport Earbuds, a result of the collaboration between Polar and Sennheiser, were also introduced at CES 2024. These earbuds combine Sennheiser\u2019s renowned sound quality with Polar\u2019s advanced fitness tracking technologies. They feature a semi-open design, active noise cancellation, and an anti-wind mode, making them ideal for outdoor activities. With an IP55 rating for moisture and dust resistance, they promise up to six hours of battery life.\nUnique to these earbuds is the integration of Polar\u2019s Flow data analytics, which includes a photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor for efficient workout planning. Priced at $329.95, they offer a comprehensive workout experience, combining high-quality audio with sophisticated fitness tracking.\nLike\u00a0this article?\u00a0Subscribe to our monthly newsletter\u00a0and\u00a0never miss out!\nMarko founded Gadgets & Wearables in 2014, having worked for more than 15 years in the City of London\u2019s financial district.

        "raw_content": "Best in show: Best wearables from CES 2024\nTable of contents\nCES 2024 is winding down after a bumper year of health innovations, smart rings, and more spatial headsets and smart glasses than you can shake a stick at.\nWith so many announcements to keep track of, we've compiled our favorite new and upcoming releases that debuted on the show floor in Las Vegas.\nEverything on this list has us mightily intrigued for the coming year - and these new releases show that it's set to be another hectic one in the world of wearable tech.\nGarmin Lily 2\nWareable\nGarmin came back with the impossibly small Garmin Lily 2 smartwatch - a hybrid smartwatch aimed at women.\nAvailable in standard and the more premium 'Classic' designs, the 34mm/35mm case is noticeably tiny when viewed in person. It still comes with the textured lens which gives an attractive effect even when the screen is dimmed.\nNew additions for Lily 2 are new dance sport profiles, and the inclusion of the new Body Battery, sleep score, Morning Report, and Garmin Pay functionality (for the Classic model).\nGarmin HRM-Fit\nWareable\nThe launch of the Garmin HRM-Fit rounded out a female-focused CES for the fitness giant.\nThe heart rate monitor strap clips onto medium- and high-support sports bras \u2013 including those from Adidas, Athleta, NoBull, and Under Armour - and aims to solve the pain point with sports bras and traditional chest straps.\nAs you\u2019d expect, the HRM-Fit can connect to a range of Garmin watches and Edge cycling computers, and also feed features the full gamut of Garmin's Running Dynamics metrics.\nAmazfit Helios\nWareable\nA surprise smart ring from Zepp Health landed at CES \u2013 the Amazfit Helios. It's designed to complement the company's performande wearables, by focussing on recovery and physical/mental readiness.\nThe band itself is a slightly weight 4g, but offers 100ATM water resistance and comes in silver and gold options.\nIt also offers users the AI chatbot coaching options via a premoium tier level within the Zepp Health app.\nMovano Evie\nWareable\nThe long-awaited Evie is about to launch - and doesn't disappoint as a smart ring for women.\nThe unique design not only enables the band to slightly expand to fit perfectly even when the finger swells during the natural monthly cycle, but it also makes for an attractive smart ring that\u2019s easy to like.\nThe metrics and analysis are still quite basic, but the AI-powered insights will grow the longer you wear it. There\u2019s plenty to come from Movano, but users will need to be patient with this one.\nRead our hands-on with the Movano Evie.\nAbbott Lingo\nWareable\nFollowing a public preview period over the last few months, health company Abbott used CES 2024 to announce that its Lingo continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is now on sale in the UK.\nThe semi-invasive CGM comes as a single sensor for \u00a389 (or as a four-pack for \u00a3300), with users able to place it on their arm and use the companion app to monitor spikes and dips in their blood glucose.\nWhile it may appear to be a medical device targeted at diabetics, Abbott has instead talked up the Lingo as a wearable that everybody can use to form healthier habits relating to sleep, mood, focus, and energy.\nWe're looking forward to testing this one out once we get back across the pond.\nWithings BeamO\nWareable\nWithings is getting pretty used to introducing its bleeding-edge tech at CES, and this year was no different. The brand used CES 2024 to debut the BeamO - a rectangular-shaped device that provides four types of medical-grade readings from home.\nIt's able to take an electrocardiogram (ECG), read the user's temperature, view blood oxygen saturation, and act as a stethoscope to track heart rate and listen out for respiratory sounds.\nThe BeamO hasn't been cleared by medical regulators just yet, however, which is why no pricing or availability information has been released by Withings just yet.\nIt wins our award for the best-named product at CES this year, at least.\nLuxottica/Nuance Audio\nWareable\nThese smart specs \u2013 manufactured by EssilorLuxoticca, the owner of Ray-Ban \u2013 use beamforming technology to identify the person you're talkung to in a crowded room and amplify their voice.\nIt's aimed at people with mild to moderate hearing loss, who struggle to follow conversations in crowded environments. It also means that users don't have to wear conspicious earbuds, \u00a0or get fitted by an audiologist for hearing aids, with the associated stigmas.\nXREAL Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWareable\nThe XREAL Air AR glasses impressed us in our demo at Pepcom on day one of CES 2024.\nFollowing Apple's lead for spatial computijng, the glasses showed off high quality and impressive immersion of virtual objects, and reacted to physical controllers on the table top to switch between modes.\nWe navigated virtual desktops, video calling demos and even movie watching.\nSome elements were a little rudimentary and agricultural in their appliation \u2013 but by and large, an impressive demonstratioin of spatial computing in a relatively small pair of XR specs.\nInvoxia Minitailz\nWareable\nThis pet tracker caught the eye, with an AI element that's designed to track your pet's health and watch out for changes in their behavior.\nDesigned for cats and dogs (but arguably a little big for felines), the Minitailz monitors heart rate, scans for heart conditions including Afib, and looks for subtle changes in your pet's activity levels or behavior.\nIt's also a GPS tracker too, with a $8.99 monthly subscription.\nHow we test\nBy James Stables\nJames is the co-founder of\u00a0Wareable, and he has been a technology journalist for 15 years.\nHe started his career at Future Publishing, James became the features editor of T3 Magazine and T3.com and was a regular contributor to TechRadar \u2013 before leaving Future Publishing to found\u00a0Wareable in 2014.\nJames has been at the helm of Wareable since 2014 and has become one of the leading experts in wearable technologies globally.

It\u2019s not fully clear what \u2013 but there have been rumblings of an updated Garmin Lily 2 smartwatch for a few months (there was a leak back in early Dec), and trademarks for a potential HRM-Fit.\nGarmin does leave its bigger launches for later in the year, and we just had the Venu 3 and Vivoactive 5 \u2013 so don\u2019t expect a bumper showing. But CES is also about innovation, so we could see more expansion of Garmin Health or AI integrations.\nSamsung\nLikely a quiet show for Samsung \u2013 but there\u2019s a chance of seeing the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3, which is MIA after being spotted at regulators. We\u2019d also love to see the Galaxy Ring, and CES would logically be the perfect place to tease it, ahead of a late 2024 launch. But Samsung is the leakiest company going, and the fact that isn\u2019t common knowledge would indicate it\u2019s probably not happening.\nWithings\nWithings is always big at CES, and last year it brought the pee-sensing U-Scan. We will certainly see something at CES, but expect it to be something in the consumer medical space, and less about shiny wearables. We will also get hands-on with the ScanWatch Nova, which was already confirmed earlier in December.\nFitbit\nWho knows if Fitbit could update one of its devices at CES. It\u2019s a new world under Google, and there are a lot of products in its ranks that are overdue updates. The Luxe would be the obvious candidate, given that Google appears to see Fitbit as a vehicle for activity bands, it could happen. It feels unlikely given the lack of leaks \u2013 but one to keep an eye on.\nAbbott\nAbbott will show off its consumer CGM play at CES, which has been in the works for over a year and has been previewed in the UK. Lingo is the company\u2019s \u201cbiowearable\u201d and is designed to train users to live a lower glucose life. It\u2019s not the only device of its kind, but given Abbott makes the sensors that its rivals use, it\u2019s one to take notice of.\nVuzix\nVuzix will be showing off its new connected smartglasses at CES \u2013 and while they will be OEM specs likely headed to enterprise markets, we\u2019re keen to see the progress made. We spoke to Vuzix CEO Paul Travers \u00a0earlier this year, and his comments about the progress of the company\u2019s lenses made for interesting reading. The future of AR should be here to see.\nL\u2019Oreal\nL\u2019Oreal has a history in wearables, and its CEO Nicolas Hieronimus is taking one of the CES keynote slots. There\u2019s no indication about whether this will be launched to the release of a wearable, but there\u2019s a strong indication that there could be a link to its UV protection sensing capabilities.\nHealth and AI\nIf there\u2019s set to be a theme of this year\u2019s show, AI will be it. You won\u2019t be able to move for AI, AI start-ups, brandnameGPT, and shoehorned in ways for companies to be relevant by using the word AI.\nBut one area of significant interest for AI will be health and wearables. Smarter algorithms are the missing link between the sensors and making insights interesting and actionable. This is a problem we\u2019ve been talking about for 10 years.\nInteresting start-ups such as January AI, which uses AI to predict sensor data when you\u2019re not wearing one, will show us how AI can improve healthcare.\nDigital Health and wearables tracks/keynotes worth watching\nSun 7 Jan:1-2:45pm, Showstoppers preview, Mandalay Bay Palm A4-4:45pm, CES 2023 Tech Trends To Watch, Mandalay Bay Shoreline Exhibit Hall5-8:30pm, CES Unveiled party, a showcase of CES Innovation Award honorees, Mandalay Bay Shoreline Exhibit Hall\nTues 9 Jan \u2013 8:30AMCTA Opening Remarks with Gary Shapiro, L\u2019Oreal CEO Nicolas Hieronimus\nTues 9 Jan\u00a0 \u2013 4PM \u2013 LVCCMedicine without borders \u2013 global health driven by AI\nWed 10 Jan \u2013 4PM - LVCCFuture of biosensing technology: Diabetes and beyond\nWed 10 Jan - 2PM \u2013 VenetianThe personalized food future\nWed 10 Jan \u2013 1PM \u2013 LVCCGen AI and the future of healthcare\nThurs 11 Jan \u2013 1PM \u2013 LVCCHow tech can transform women's health\nHow we test\nBy James Stables\nJames is the co-founder of\u00a0Wareable, and he has been a technology journalist for 15 years.\nHe started his career at Future Publishing, James became the features editor of T3 Magazine and T3.com and was a regular contributor to TechRadar \u2013 before leaving Future Publishing to found\u00a0Wareable in 2014.\nJames has been at the helm of Wareable since 2014 and has become one of the leading experts in wearable technologies globally.

        "raw_content": "Wearable tech 2024: Predictions, devices and themes\nThe dawning of a new year is upon us \u2013 so fresh and full of opportunity. The decoratiions are down at Wareable towers and the serious business of CES 2024 is upon us.\nBut the path for 2024 is already becoming clear.\nCome with us on a journey through 2024 \u2013 and what to expect in the world of wearables.\nThe devices\nMovano Evie Ring\nWe won\u2019t have long to wait for overdue Evie Ring, which will land on fingers in 2024. The female-focussed smart ring is out to challenge Oura, which itself has gone big on women\u2019s health insights in the past 12 months.\nBut first and foremost, the Evie Ring needs to actually be a good wearable. The company has brilliant ideas about medical grade sensors and FDA approval, but it\u2019s a rookie organisation building its first device.\nWe\u2019re keen to put it through its paces \u2013 and will do so at CES.\nApple Watch X\nWareable\nAll the rumours are pointing to a special Apple Watch release in 2024, which will be the 10th anniversary of the smartwatch.\nA major design change is being touted, as well as new sensors for sleep apnea and blood pressure.\nApple will also need to overcome its patent battle with Masimo.\nAway from a specific device launch \u2013 we\u2019re also expecting to see something of a step change from Apple in terms of wellness tracking.\nIt\u2019s focused on big health metrics, but we do feel it lags as a wellness device, especially when you look at where Whoop, Oura and now Garmin have taken things. Expect a rebalancing this year.\nWhoop 5.0\nIt also seems likely that we will see a revised Whoop in 2024 \u2013 even if there are little rumors around this to date.\nThe current Whoop 4.0 landed in 2021, so it\u2019s overdue an update. As a simple vehicle for sensors, the hardware is relatively unimportant.\nHowever, we\u2019d love to see an upgrade of the heart rate sensor, and a boost in battery life.\nOura Ring Gen 4\nLikewise, the Oura Ring Gen 3 has also been out since 2021.\nIn that time, it hasn't sat still, and brought out the Oura Ring Gen 3 Horizon, an upgraded look.\nWhile Oura is still the leader of the smart ring space, the incumbent is now being challenged by the likes of the Evie Ring, Circular Ring Slim and Ultrahuman Ring Air.\nThose improvements only bring rivals to Oura's level of slimness and design.\nBut if Oura wants to stay one step ahead of the competition, it could do with slimming down its ring even further. It's still very chunky to wear, and not especially female-friendly. We'd love to see that change in 2024.\nSamsung Galaxy Ring\nThe smart ring market is one of the most interesting wearable tech sub-categories, but so far a major player hasn\u2019t made a meaningful contribution.\nSamsung has been dropping regular patents and trademarks for its own smart ring, and it feels like 2024 could be the year it's made official.\nWhile it seems unlikely that Samsung could hugely drive the category forward in terms of raw innovation \u2013 a wearable behemoth going in on smart rings would bring the category to the mainstream.\nApple Vision Pro\nWareable\nRemember that huge 'spatial computing' headset that Apple launched at WWDC? You know, the one with the virtual eyes and makes your laptop screen the size of a room? Well, that\u2019s going to be coming out this year.\nWhile it\u2019s a niche product, it will be interesting to see the splash, if any, this makes.\nAnd it will be equally interesting to see the effect it has on the rest of the AR/XR industry. If this sgement is going to break into the consumer conscioiusness, it probably should happen now.\nThe themes\nBlood pressure\nThe world of wearables and smartwatches has been waiting for a big new sensor to arrive \u2013 and it feels that blood pressure is the most likely for 2024.\nSamsung has an existing solution on the Galaxy Watch that must be verified with a cuff \u2013 and only works if you also have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, so its appeal is limited.\nSmartwatches that can detect high/low blood pressure, and bring awareness out there to the millions of hypertension suffers, would be a huge force for good.\nIt\u2019s been touted for the Apple Watch X, but the technology is also being worked on across the wearables world. So it will be interesting who can bring the functionality, and also implement a helpful and insightful feature onto watches.\nIt will also mean navigating regulatory bodies to get sign off for use \u2013 so there are some big hurdles to navigate.\nSleep apnea\nSleep apnea got the limelight a few years ago, and Fitbit and Withings offer oxygen variation readings during sleep. However, the devices stop short of talking about sleep apnea, due to limitations of not being medical devices.\nWe\u2019d expect to see this area move forward, with more prescriptive detection of sleep apnea issues, on mainstream devices.\nIt's another feature that's been touted for the Apple Watch X, and we'd be surprised if it wasn't a major talking point of Samsung and Pixel Watch releases in 2024.\nBlood glucose\nWareable\nIt seems highly unlikely that we will see non-invasive blood glucose monitoring on devices this year. But we will certainly be closer by the time 2024 is over.\nThere\u2019s a host of companies with solutions that show promise, such as UK-based Afon, Movano\u2019s RF sensor, as well as Singapore-based Actxa.\nWhile a solution for type 1 diabetics might be unrealistic for now, something that could detect spikes, or unhealthy blood sugar levels for pre-diabetics, could have huge societal benefits.\nSo expect to see some meaningful progress this year.\nAI and wearables\nWareable\n2023 was truly the year of AI, and it\u2019s unlikely to change in 2024. However, we may see a move from impressive yet ultimately useless proof of concepts (such as ChatGPT don\u2019t @ me) to meaningful implementations.\nAnd the wearables industry will be a key area for that.\nThe potential of AI is to take all the disparate data points from our wearables and make something genuinely unique from them.\nThat could mean analyzing long-term heart rate trends, mixing in long term sleep data and lifestyle inputs, to tell you something you didn\u2019t know about yourself.\nThat\u2019s a big goal \u2013 and fraught with regulatory challenges. But expect to see the first seeds of that this year, probably led by Apple\u2019s Quartz platform.\nPatent war 2.0\nIt seems we are back to the era of the patent wars of the early wearables age \u2013 and there are plenty to keep tabs on.\nApple vs Masimo is clearly a hot topic, but Apple vs AliveCor is also ongoing.\nThen there\u2019s Oura vs. Ultrahuman and Circular.\nWatch this space for the full ramifications.\nHow we test\nBy James Stables\nJames is the co-founder of\u00a0Wareable, and he has been a technology journalist for 15 years.\nHe started his career at Future Publishing, James became the features editor of T3 Magazine and T3.com and was a regular contributor to TechRadar \u2013 before leaving Future Publishing to found\u00a0Wareable in 2014.\nJames has been at the helm of Wareable since 2014 and has become one of the leading experts in wearable technologies globally.

And there are clues as to some bits that have not been officially announced. Here are some of the most notable examples.\nWithings: Eye catching innovation?\nYou can hope for something intriguing from Withings, even if it will not appear on sale all that soon. At CES 2023, Withings showed the U-Scan, a headline-grabber of an announcement. The U-Scan is a urine analysis sensor designed to be mounted inside your toilet bowl. It can measure ketones, Vitamin C levels, water composition and acid base. One year on it\u2019s still listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on the Withings website. It has teased something equally compelling may be at CES 2024, tweeting \u201cthe dawn of our next revolution is imminent\u201d on December 22.\nFitbit: Luxe 2?\nWhile there is no major suggestion Fitbit has bit launch plans for CES 2024, there are some signs a Fitbit Luxe 2 is on the way. A wearable that, assuming there are no brand new lines in the works, must be either the Luxe 2 or an Ace 4, has passed through the FCC. Such a watch is likely to appear at some point in Q4 2024. However, will it come to CES? That is much less clear. The Fitbit Luxe arrived in 2021. And Fitbit has not seen many launches since Google\u2019s acquisition of the brand in January 2021.\nSo When Is The\nRebel Moon\nR Rated Snyder Cut s Release Date Then\nMassive California Waves Hospitalize At Least Eight And Cause Evacuations Along Pacific Coast\nThree Supermoons, Two Comets And The \u2018Great American Eclipse:\u2019 The Sky In 2024\nSamsung: Fit 3 incoming\nThe Samsung Fit 3 leaked in November and is expected to launch in January. It's more likely to be seen as part of confidential meetings at CES than a major public announcement, though, as Samsung will hold one of its big Unpacked events on January 18. That\u2019s just a few days after CES closes up shop. The watch\u2019s predecessor, the Galaxy Fit 2, arrived way back in 2020. This one has a much larger OLED screen, which should make it feel more like a smartwatch.\nRuah: Easier sleep apnea diagnosis\nRuahlab Inc.\u2019s Ruah wearable has received an innovation award from the CES CEA organisation even before the show begins. From a glance it looks a bit like a face mask worn only over the nose. However, it\u2019s an AI-powered device that monitors breathing patterns, in order to help diagnose sleep apnea. As such, it\u2019s a much more convenient alternative to polysomnography, which uses a multi-sensor polysomnogram to assess sleep abnormalities.\nAbbott: Glucose monitoring\nAccording to Wareable, Abbott plans to show its consumer-focused Lingo continuous glucose monitor tech at CES 2024. This means we could be getting closer to an expansion into the US. Lingo is already available in the UK, where it costs \u00a3150 (around $190) a month and is sold as \"the future of metabolism ownership.\u201d Lingo involves wearing a biosensor to monitor for glucose spikes.\nInception Lab: Bedsore diagnosis\nInception Lab is another winner of a CES innovation award. Its work is in the healthcare industry, but is a technology anyone can understand. It has made a bedsore sensor called Inception One. They are placed in \u201careas suspected of bedsores\u201d in order to help diagnose the problem without relying simply on a visual inspection.\nYou can expect news at CES to start pumping out from January 7, one of two \u201cMedia Days\u201d ahead of the show\u2019s opening."

Here\u2019s how it works.\n5 trends that will define wearables in 2024 and beyond\nFrom on-the-wrist AI to improved fitness tracking for Fido, here's what to watch\nCES 2024 is right around the corner, which means this is the perfect time to make predictions about which tech wearable trends will be most noteworthy this year. With no shortage of exciting new devices rumored to be on the horizon \u2014 including an Apple Watch 10, Pixel Watch 3 and Oura Ring 4 \u2014 \u00a0there\u2019s much to look forward to.\nBy the way, I\u2019m not talking brighter screens, better battery life or a wider array of styles and designs \u2014 every refresh of the calendar comes with those expected spec bumps. What follows are the major features, functions and trends that I believe will set 2024's tech wearables apart from years prior.\n1. AI everywhere, including on your wrist\nWhile some consumer tech brands will talk the talk, others will walk the AI walk.\nAI is the buzzword of the moment. In 2024, it will lose all meaning thanks to overuse by desperate corporate marketing departments. But don't worry about that. While some consumer tech brands will talk the talk, others will walk the AI walk earnestly by meaningfully incorporating AI-based features into products.\nWindows is bringing a dedicated AI chatbot button to future desktop keyboards. What might AI integration look like for tech wearables? We will find out soon. The Black Shark S1 Pro, a smartwatch built for hardcore gamers, will launch soon with ChatGPT Voice support built-in, likely allowing users to accomplish an enormous range of tasks via voice \u2014 far more than what Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri currently offer.\nWith ChatGPT Voice now available to the masses for free, we will undoubtedly see other smartwatch makers rush to incorporate the feature successfully.\nOn the fitness tracking side, expect major players like Apple, Google and Garmin to continue leveraging AI-powered processing \u2014 under the hood \u2014 to get the most out of user data. This could potentially lead to better fitness tracking accuracy, improved screening for health anomalies and more personalized workout and recovery recommendations.\n2. A greater focus on non-wrist-based wearables\nThe Oura Ring is one of the most popular smart rings on the market, with a focus on fitness, sleep and recovery tracking. Unlike most standard fitness devices, such as Fitbits and Apple Watches, it is rather unassuming \u2014 to the casual observer, the Oura appears to be nothing more than an ordinary stainless steel band.\n2024 will likely bring with it a refresh of the current Oura Ring to Generation Four. We suspect the new device will have a thinner design, additional health-centric features and possibly even support for digital payments.\nSamsung also appears set to launch its own smart ring soon (maybe even next week). Our look at the rumored Samsung Galaxy Ring has more on that device.\nA new flagship Movano Evie Ring should also be dropping in 2024, with an even greater focus on women\u2019s health tracking. And unlike the Oura Ring Gen 3, the updated Evie likely will not require a monthly subscription.\nWill we see smart ring releases from more big tech players, like Apple or Google? Possibly. The smart ring market is still small but definitely growing.\n3. Improved monitoring for serious health conditions\nMost modern smartwatches keep tabs on sleep quality, stress levels and heart rate. Many models also sport onboard ECG sensors to monitor for signs of an irregular heartbeat that might indicate a user has atrial fibrillation or AFIB, a potentially deadly condition.\nIn 2024, new smartwatches will monitor for an even wider range of serious health conditions, including hypertension and sleep apnea. Both are silent killers that can go unnoticed, potentially leading to heart failure or stroke.\nThe next-generation Apple Watch 10, for instance, is tipped to scan for signs of hypertension using some form of wrist-based blood pressure monitoring. Meanwhile, sleep apnea alerts could be generated when major disturbances in breathing patterns are detected.\nApple, of course, is not the only brand we expect to roll out improved health monitoring tech. The forthcoming Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 will also likely boast on-wrist blood pressure readings, pending FDA approval in the US.\n4. A wider selection of health wearables for pets\nWhile subscription-based GPS dog collars have been around for a while, pet wearables focused solely on monitoring health \u2014 including physical activity, diet and sleep \u2014 are becoming more common.\nFitBark, for instance, sells its device with and without an onboard GPS. The latter is a one-and-done purchase of $69. The UK-based brand PitPat similarly sells its dog activity monitor in two varieties, depending on your needs and tolerance for subscription pricing.\nIn 2024, expect to see a wider selection of pet health-tracking wearables come to market, both in the form of collars and collar accessories. Also, be on the lookout for traditional tech companies making the jump into pet wellness. What might a \u201cFitbit Woof\u201d look like \u2014 how about the \u201cApple iDog\u201d collar?\nUltimately, pets are big business \u2014 in 2022, Americans spent more than $136 billion on their furry friends alone \u2014 and big tech loves big market opportunities.\n5. A continuing cascade of legal disputes\nLast but not least, 2024 will surely be another action-packed year of legal disputes over intellectual property, stolen trade secrets, copyright infringement and more.\nApple is presently in the middle of a multi-year legal battle over its blood oxygen monitoring tech, which may or may not reach its grand finale in 2024. And that is just one of several patent kerfuffles facing the Cupertino giant. Another medical device maker, AliveCor, has also accused Apple of patent theft. That case is pending but will likely see a conclusion soonish.\nAnother doozy to keep an eye on is the recent copyright infringement lawsuit by the New York Times against OpenAI, maker of the popular AI-based ChatGPT. More specifically, the Times says OpenAI trained its bots using copyrighted material. The verdict could have wide-reaching implications on how and when artificial intelligence features are adopted in popular tech wearables.\nThese are just a few of the significant tech-related legal battles likely to play out in 2024. Expect countless more lawsuits, both frivolous and legit, to unfold in the coming 12 months.\n2024 tech wearable trends: What else?\nAnd there you have it \u2014 an entire year of wearable tech trends summed up in one concise article. Of course, these aren't the only ones to be on the lookout for. This is where you come in. What trends do you think will have the greatest impact on smartwatches, fitness trackers and wearable tech in 2024?

        "raw_content": "Garmin & Samsung wearable innovations shine at CES 2024 awards\nThe CES Innovation Awards, a focal point of CES 2024, recognise groundbreaking achievements in this dynamic field. This year the star performer was the Venu 3 with its triple win. Garmin has snapped up a few more awards, along with Samsung and Movano Health.\nCES, a cornerstone event in the tech world, is scheduled to take place between January 9th and 12th, 2024, in Las Vegas, Nevada. That\u2019s slightly later than last year. Some 2,400 business were there in 2023, showcasing their products to more than 100,000 people who attended the gathering. In 2024, we are expecting an even bigger turnout.\nLeading into the event, the CES Innovation Awards take center stage. Organisers distribute these awards to winners and honourable mentions across a wide spectrum of categories. A key caveat to note: companies must actively register their products for eligibility.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

The one that we really like is a jaw flex because it's very subtle.\"\nThe founder of the start-up initially started the project to help a paralyzed friend play video games again, Alexander said.\nThe company is now looking for headphone manufacturers willing to integrate the technology into their products.\n- Movie screen glasses -\nOnly slightly bulkier than conventional eyewear, XREAL's augmented reality (AR) glasses project a movie theater-sized screen into thin air.\n\"Wear these on a flight, in a car, or on a train -- you're going to have a big screen experience that comes right out of your pocket,\" says Ralph Jodice, head of PR for the Chinese company.\n\"When you're sitting at your desk, whether it's in the office or at home, we can put three virtual screens floating out in space.\"\nSensors can also track hand movements, enabling the creation of virtual 3D applications.\nThe various models cost between $400 and $700.\n- Muting masks -\nWith the Skyted silent mask, you can finally make that important call in a train's quiet car.\nWearing the surgical mask-sized device, \"your voice doesn't go out and noise doesn't come in,\" explains Stephane Hersen, the French company's founder.\nThe sound-absorbing mask connects to telephones or computers, allowing users to make \"silent, confidential calls in any circumstance,\" says the former Airbus employee, highlighting noisy offices.\nHe says the company has a completely different outlook after the Covid-19 pandemic, which changed many peoples' perceptions of wearing masks.\n- 'Eyes' in the back of your head -\nWhile working as a corrections officer, .simstechnology founder Sean Siembab says he was attacked from behind, suffering a traumatic brain injury.\nDuring his rehab, a bicyclist hit him -- from behind.\n\"At that point, I said 'there's got to be something out there that alerts you.'\"\nHe got to work developing an accessory worn on users' backs that warns them when someone approaches from behind. With a tiny camera, it also films the interaction.\nUsers then have the option of sending an SOS message from their phone or smartwatch.\nThe device is expected to retail for $199, with a $79 per year fee to store video footage in the cloud.\n- Speed-walking shoes -\nWhy run when you can walk faster? Users wearing Shift Robotics' electric wheeled device -- over their shoes -- glide along without breaking a sweat.\n\"They are not (roller) skates -- they don't coast... If you stop walking, they don't move at all,\" explains Shift Robotics marketing director David Politis.\nHe says the latest version -- the Moonwalkers X -- are faster and lighter than their predecessor.\n\"Walking is fine, but there are certain instances where people walk a lot,\" says Politis, highlighting warehouses where employees are on their feet all day.\nTouting the device's benefits on productivity, he says that IKEA, which piloted the shoes in a store in Sweden, estimates that employees wearing the Moonwalkers could save \"nearly 400 hours a year.\"\nNo walking is needed for Skwheel's electric skis, however -- nor snow, for that matter.\nManufactured by a French start-up, the battery-powered skates seek to replicate the feeling of skiing, on or offroad.\nSome customers may use them for a fun daily commute, but the company also intends to sell them to winter sports stores for summer rentals.\njuj/des/sst"

        "raw_content": "MENU\nWearable trends at CES 2024\nThe latest developments in wearable and hearable technologies were much in evidence at CES in 2024.\nNew wearable technologies at CES 2024 include an operating system that allows different audio technologies to be added to earphones as an app, and the world\u2019s smallest MEMS-based accelerometer with AI that changes the way such systems are controlled.\nUK startup Earswitch was showing technology developed at the University of Bath to help people with disabilities communicate, is showcasing a new product at CES, the world\u2019s biggest technology show.\nThe company, set up to help people with disabilities including motor neurone disease (MND, also known as ALS) to communicate, showed its new EarControl assistive technology at the show.\nThis uses a built-in sensor to detect movements of a tiny muscle known as the tensor tympani in the ear, allowing users to operate an assistive keyboard. An assistive screen scans letters and words which users can select by tensing the\u00a0ear\u00a0muscle.\nIt\u2019s believed that with degenerative conditions such as MND, control of the tensor tympani muscle is preserved for longer than other muscles, and so the team hope the technology can support users for longer.\nEarControl allows people who cannot use traditional input devices, such as a mouse or keyboard, to interact with a computer by acting as a 3D \u2018ear\u00a0mouse\u2019. Earbuds that track a user\u2019s focus and selects an icon from the screen of a linked device with an\u00a0ear\u00a0click. The technology works because the tensor tympani moves the ear\u00a0drums as eyes move.\nIn addition to harnessing the muscle to help people with neurological conditions, the team also believe applications could extend to\u00a0ear\u00a0controls for mobile phones, or for gaming.\n\u201cThe collaboration with University of Bath continues to be pivotal in the advancement of\u00a0EarSwitch\u00a0to improve communication for people with conditions such as MND,\u201d said Dr Nick Gompertz, founder of EarSwitch.\n\u201cThe importance of this opportunity has been recognised by the Scott-Morgan Foundation (SMF) with whom we will be demonstrating EarControl as part of a collaborative of assistive technologies at CES.\u00a0We are working with SMF to give everyone the Right to Thrive.\u201d\nDr Ben Metcalfe, Deputy Director of the Bath Institute for the Augmented Human, says: \u201cWe are delighted that\u00a0EarSwitch\u00a0continues to go from strength to strength, and their recent showing at CES 2024 demonstrates their remarkable achievements over the past few years.\n\u201cThe\u00a0EarSwitch\u00a0technology has the potential to transform the quality of life of those living with conditions such as motor neurone disease, and it is so pleasing to see that this work continues in the spirit of Peter Scott-Morgan and the Scott-Morgan Foundation. Developing a new medical device is a complex process, and we continue to support\u00a0EarSwitch\u00a0with both core technology development and ongoing clinical trials required for full regulatory approval. It is a real pleasure to see such continued success from Nick and the team.\u201d\nCeva also signed a strategic partnership with the world\u2019s second largest supplier of earphones and wearables.\nThe deal with boAt (Imagine Marketing Limited) in India covers the next generation of lifestyle-focused consumer products, including TWS earbuds, neckbands, headphones, speakers and smartwatches.\nboAt overtook Xiaomi, Samsung in Q3\u201923 to become 2nd largest wearable maker in the world, after Apple according to IDC.\nThe partnership spans a broad range of Ceva\u2019s connectivity, sensing and inferencing technologies, which \u2018boAt Labs\u2019, the in-house research and development team, will use to develop high-quality products that provide the best user experience possible at accessible price points.\nboAt uses Bluetooth audio chipsets from different semiconductor suppliers today, several of which are based on Ceva\u2019s Bluetooth platforms and/or Audio AI DSPs. Through this collaboration, Ceva and boAt will partner to select Bluetooth audio chipsets from Ceva licensees for boAt product lines and optimize Ceva value-add software packages for these products, including TWS earbuds, neckbands, headphones, smart speakers, and smartwatches.\nThe Xreal Air 2 Ultra smart glasses launched at CES 2024\nThe first boAt product under this partnership, the Nirvana Eutopia Spatial Audio headphones, feature CEVA\u2019s Bluetooth, Audio AI DSP, and its RealSpace\u00a0spatial audio\u00a0software with precise head tracking. These are the first spatial audio headphones in boAt\u2019s lineup to offer dynamic head tracking capabilities which further enhance the spatial audio experience.\nThe Nirvana Eutopia headphones are expected to be available in\u00a0India\u00a0in the first quarter of 2024.\n\u201cWe\u2019re constantly seeking the foremost technologies and innovations for our product roadmap and Ceva is a tremendous partner in this regard. Their broad portfolio of software, including audio, voice, and motion sensing technologies opens many opportunities to bring new features and capabilities to boAt products,\u201d said Sameer Mehta, Co-founder, and CEO, Imagine Marketing Limited, boAt parent company,\nWearable headsets were overshadowed by the announcement of the pricing for the Apple Vision Pro headset. Several smart glasses suppliers took aim at the $3499 price point of the Apple technology, with Xreal renewing its collaboration with Qualcomm and RayNeo showing its smart glasses. Display developers Omnivision and MoJo also launched new technologies that will drive up the quality of the display in smart glasses while driving down the cost and power consumption.\nwww.ceva-ip.com/product/ceva-realspace; www.omnivision.com; www.ceva.com; www.earswitch.com; www.sonical.com; www.xreal.com\nAll material on this site Copyright \u00a9 2022\nEuropean Business Press SA.

Check out our 10 favorite fitness gadgets from the show.\nI\u2019m PCMag\u2019s senior analyst covering smart home and wearable devices. I\u2019ve been writing about tech professionally for nearly a decade and have been obsessing about it for much longer than that. Prior to joining PCMag, I made educational videos for an electronics store called Abt Electronics in Illinois, and before that I spent eight years covering the smart home market for CNET.\nAt CES 2024, digital health devices moved beyond the wrist. From mental-health-focused smart mirrors to app-adjustable mattresses, our top 10 picks show that the wellness tech market is rife with innovation. And it's not necessarily the biggest players in the space who are driving it forward, as most of our favorite health and fitness tech at CES come from relatively unknown brands.\nIn no particular order, these are our 10 favorite health and fitness devices from CES this year.\nWithings BeamO\nThe Withings BeamO makes your thermometer look lazy. A \u201cmultiscope\u201d device for at-home health checkups, the BeamO packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to listen to your lungs, and, yes, a thermometer too. Thanks to its multitude of sensors, it promises to detect atrial fibrillation, heart murmurs, wheezing, and more. The device itself looks like a compact remote control, but you can put the thermometer to your forehead, then flip the gadget and place the stethoscope against your chest before using the electrodes to take heart rate and blood oxygenation readings. All of this data can be readily shared with your doctor, and the stethoscope even records audio files. You can be sure that we plan to test the accuracy of this conceptually cool gadget when it launches this June for $249.95.\nBaracoda BMind\nLook into this mirror to discover a reflection of your mind. While Withings is one-upping your thermometer, Baracoda is introducing a smart bathroom mirror that delivers mental health and wellness advice. The Baracoda BMind uses generative AI and natural language processing to understand your daily mood and stress levels. You can use the mirror as a touch screen to browse its CareOS interface and start automatically generated light therapy sessions or mindfulness exercises. Who knew your morning routine could include mirror therapy? Baracoda hasn't announced a price or release date for the BMind.\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nThe BMind focuses on mental health while another smart mirror from the traditionally software-focused NuraLogix uses contactless optical imagery and remote photoplethysmography to gauge both mental well-being and physical metrics such as blood pressure, BMI, facial skin age, heart rate variability, and more. The Anura MagicMirror will be aimed at businesses like gyms and nursing homes rather than your personal bathroom countertop. That likely means it will have a lofty price tag, but Nuralogix hasn\u2019t announced a specific figure or release date.\nLaifen Wave Electric Toothbrush\nWe\u2019ve seen smart toothbrushes at CES before, and the Laifen Wave Electric Toothbrush doesn\u2019t offer a crazy new shape or app-based gimmick. Instead, start-up Laifen promises a \"3x increase in brushing efficiency\" compared with the competition thanks to its servo motor system that allows the toothbrush to vibrate 66,000 times per minute while simultaneously oscillating 60 degrees to thoroughly clean the length of your teeth. If that sounds a bit like taking a belt sander to your mouth, Laifen promises that its Gum Care brush head protects your tissue using 0.02mm ultra-fine tapered bristles. It will also offer Super-Clean and Ultra-Whitening brush heads and you can fine-tune the oscillation range and speed as well as vibration strength in the app. The Laifen Wave Electric Toothbrush will be available to purchase on March 5 from the company\u2019s site and Amazon, with prices varying based on the finish of the handle: $69 for plastic, $79 for aluminum alloy, or $99 for stainless steel.\nGarmin Lily 2\nThe original Garmin Lily is one of our favorite fitness trackers, so we were excited to see its sequel announced at CES. At first glance, the Lily 2 looks quite similar to its predecessor, but the new model replaces some of the previous model's plastic with metal, adds a few new color options, and expands the battery life. Garmin has raised the price by $50 on both the Sport and Classic versions to $249.99 and $279.99 respectively. Otherwise, this looks to be the same stylish and capable Lily, complete with a robust array of health sensors and smart features. If the new styles suit you, the Lily 2 is available now.\nZoe Care Zoe Fall\nThe safety-focused Zoe Fall is like a medical alert system that monitors your well-being from the wall. You simply plug it into a standard wall outlet and the app-connected device uses deep-learning algorithms to determine when someone nearby has fallen based on the disturbances in the surrounding Wi-Fi waves. If you take a tumble, it can send an alert to a caregiver through the app. A single Zoe Fall plug can purportedly monitor up to 800 square feet, and the simple plug-and-play design is aimed at allowing senior citizens to live independently with peace of mind and without needing cameras or wearable gadgets that might violate their privacy or fashion sense. Zoe Care has not yet announced a price or release date for the Zoe Fall.\nElo Smart Gummies\nIf you\u2019re having trouble eating healthy, try these 3D-printed vitamin gummies. Backed by rock climbing legend Tommy Caldwell, the Elo Smart Gummies promise to deliver the nutrition of seven ordinary health pills in just one yummy gummy. The Smart Gummies can be personalized with eight different flavors and 389 million possible combinations of nutrients. They're available on Elo's site now. To select your layers and find out a price, you need to take an online assessment.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nAnssil Smart String i4 Smart Mattress\nWatch out, Sleep Number. Korean start-up Anssil showed off a customizable mattress made of strings at CES. Yes, you read that right. The Smart String i4 doesn\u2019t use air, foam, or springs for support, but 14 million polyester threads. The material supposedly allows it to maintain its shape for longer than traditional mattress materials, and adapt across a wide range of firmness settings. You can pick from 10 adjustable cushion levels in a companion app, and see data collected by the built-in pressure sensor and scale. Thanks to those sensors, the app will show you detailed sleep and health information and can sync with your smart scale or wearable. Anssil hasn't announced pricing or a release date for the Smart String i4.\nUltrahuman Home\nIt might look like a modem, but the Ultrahuman Home is actually a health-tracking device for your environment. Built-in sensors measure air quality, humidity, light, and noise levels. Its software processes sensor data locally and tracks it over time. A companion app highlights any red flags or changes in your environment that might cause different health issues such as rising stress levels or decreased sleep. The $349 device is slated to go on sale via Kickstarter this month.\nInvoxia Minitailz Smart Pet Tracker\nThe Invoxia Minitailz Smart Pet Tracker is a digital health device for your fuzziest family members. It attaches to any cat or dog collar and tracks their heart vitals, respiration, scratching, and more to uncover potential health issues. According to Invoxia, the device is even capable of detecting canine and feline atrial fibrillation (AFib), a serious heart condition. It also tracks your fur baby's daily activities (including barking, eating/eating, resting, running, scratching, and walking) and location. If you want to closely monitor your pet\u2019s health, the dog version is already available on the company\u2019s website and the cat version is expected to arrive in March. Both cost $99.\nThe Best Digital Health Devices You Can Get Now\nFor more high-tech wellness to jump-start your year, check out the best health and fitness tech we've tested.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "10 wearables (and health devices) you might have missed at CES 2024\nCES 2024 has now come to a close, and we need a well-earned rest after a week of chasing down wearables across downtown Las Vegas.\nHighlights were the Movano Evie, new Garmin Lily 2, and some promising consumer smart glasses.\nBut the halls of the Expo were full of interesting wearables, far too many to report individually.\nRead on for some of the wearables you might have missed from this year's show.\nVuzix Ultralite S\nWareable\nA follow-up to the Ultralite and new for CES 2024, the sportier-looking Ultralite S also features an incognito mode so people can\u2019t see the text or visuals through the front of the smartglasses.\nVuzix is still focused on the enterprise market, although Ultralite is an OEM product that companies could use as the basis of consumer products.\nWe got to try the Ultralite S on the show floor and had a variety of demos including turn-by-turn directions, text-to-speech, and translations.\nThe Ultralite S is seriously impressive in terms of the form factor, but still very basic in the quality of the heads-up display visuals. It\u2019s also quite hard to focus on the text, and I closed one eye to read long passages of text.\nPete Jameson, COO of Vuzix revealed to Wareable that it was working on a microLED solution that would be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for smart eyewear \u2013 which was still \u201ca year and a half\u201d away.\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nWareable\nSennheiser announced the Momentum Sport, a brand new pair of heart rate monitoring headphones, which use Polar algorithms to track your workout performance.\nThe Powered By Polar device features an optical heart rate sensor, and temperature sensor and broadcasts over Bluetooth, so it can be used by Pelotons, smartwatches and your smartphone.\nBut you can plug them into Polar Flow, and get performance analytics such as Training Load Pro, Training Benefit, and even body temperature measurements.\nStelo by Dexcom\nWareable\nWith Abbott getting into consumer CGMs with Lingo, it's no surprise that Dexcom has its product coming too. It's launched Stelo, a pared-back version of its G7 CGM, which is designed for Type 2 diabetics to understand their glucose levels. The app will track spikes and provide insights into the foods that cause high blood sugar.\nNextSense earbuds\nWareable\nThe NextSense project was born out of Google X, which certainly caught our eye \u2013 and it\u2019s led to two different products. The original project was a pair of EEG earbuds designed to offer an early warning for epileptic seizures.\nThat will be a few years away, but the same technology is being used for the NextSense sleep earbuds.\nThe same EEG tech will read your brain evaluate your sleep strategies, and enable users to work out the best way to get decent sleep. The EEG can power sleep sounds and soundscapes but also inform users about the effectiveness of treatments such as melatonin.\nIt's set to launch at the end of 2024.\nInvoxia Minitailz\nWareable\nThis pet tracker is a GPS tracker for dogs and cats \u2013 that also acts as a fitness tracker and wellness monitor. It tracks heart rate, will detect Afib, and also uses AI to warn if your pet\u2019s behaviour is changing. It can be retrofitted to your pet\u2019s existing collar.\nAmira Terra\nWareable\nThis menopause wearable will detect hot flashes from the wrist and track them within the partner app. There\u2019s also a cooling element, which uses cold water to chill a pad, which can be placed on a bed or seat to cool the body until the feeling passes and aid in better sleep.\nIdentifyHer\nIrish startup IdentityHer uses a stick-on sensor to track the symptoms of menopause. The sensor sticks to the chest, and tracks key menopausal symptoms, without the need for self-reporting.\nThe mix of sensors will track temperature, hot flashes, anxiety, and sleep. With so little research into menopause, IdentifyHer aims to help women manage their symptoms, and assess the effectiveness of treatment packages faster.\nMindLink Air\nWareable\nThese eye-tracking glasses from Canadian start-up AdHawk are designed to track the health of the brain.\nCapturing eye movements, the Mindlink Air glasses will record eye behavior and movement, blink activity, pupil dilation, gaze behavior, fixation depth, and fixation depth.\nVia the app, Mindlink will report on mental focus, and cognitive load and even assess your reading speed.\nBenzamin AI sleep controller\nBenzamin\nThis South Korean startup puts a sensor under your mattress to detect vital signs during sleep.\nThat might not sound particularly innovative, but there\u2019s more than meets the eye.\nAs well as detecting heart rate, breathing rate, and other metrics via vibrations through the mattress, it will also vibrate back, syncing to your heart rate, which it claims can boost autonomic system activity by 146% and parasympathetic nervous system activity by 116%.\nWhat does all that mean? Better sleep \u2013 but only if you live in South Korea because that's where it's launching first.\nErgoSportive smart bed\nWareable\nThis connected bed base turns your existing mattress into a smart bed and can hook up to your Garmin smartwatch. The bed base can track heart rate and respiration rate, tracking your sleep in real-time and manipulating the mattress to aid your rest. Examples could include lifting the mattress under the head if you\u2019re snoring.\nInterestingly, the bed is part of the Garmin Connectable program. That means it will populate Garmin Connect with sleep metrics if you don\u2019t want to wear your smartwatch to bed.\nHow we test\nBy James Stables\nJames is the co-founder of\u00a0Wareable, and he has been a technology journalist for 15 years.\nHe started his career at Future Publishing, James became the features editor of T3 Magazine and T3.com and was a regular contributor to TechRadar \u2013 before leaving Future Publishing to found\u00a0Wareable in 2014.\nJames has been at the helm of Wareable since 2014 and has become one of the leading experts in wearable technologies globally. He has reviewed, tested, and covered pretty much every wearable on the market, and is passionate about the evolving industry, and wearables helping people achieve healthier and happier lives."
