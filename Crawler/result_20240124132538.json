ITRI will showcase many of its AI supported platforms ranging from sports to manufacturing.\nITRI\u2019s CES 2024 Showcase Technologies:\nAR Interactive Vehicle Display\nThe disply, is transparent enabling passengers to view and interact with augmented reality (AR) with no need for wearables within a moving vehicle. Visual information on sites of interest is presented in real-time as the AR\u00a0follows the\u00a0user\u2019s line of sight. Interacting with visual clues gives more detaild information. The platform is customizable to fit differing modes of transportation and vehicle windows.\nThe Detachable Joint Robot System\nThe solution is a compact robot joint module capable of immediate construction of various robots with heterogenous configurations (different numbers of joints and various payloads). EtherCat is utilized for peripheral communication to apply integration and coordination of drive controllers, sensors, brakes, motors, and encoders. According to ITRI, five minutes is enough for joint replacement via the detachable mechanism designed in ITRI\u2019s robot joint.\nRoboTwin: Metaverse Smart Factory Simulation Platform\nInnovative AI and Sim2Real technologies create a life-like simulation of a factory where engineers and operators can encounter realistic and immersive controls by way of user interfaces. Problems can be resolved by teleoperation. Other benefits include coaching, multi-agent communication from differing sites, remote troubleshooting, and maintenance. Ideal applications are semiconductors, machinery, and manufacturing.\niGolfPutter\niGolfPutter is a smart golf analysis and training system that provides indoor players with the sensation of playing on an outdoor course. Powered by ITRI\u2019s 3D sensing AI analysis technology, iGolfPutter analyzes the users swing posture and body stance with their smartphone. Sensing chips are integrated into the specialized golf balls and club head\u00a0to collect data, including swing angles, swing speeds, ball flight trajectories, speeds, and paths. After a user swing, AIoT is capable of recreating terrain from a selected golf course for the next putt.\nITRI will also have on display its portfolio of AI display and entertainment technology, PetPet Cam, iSwimWeaR, and Mountain Watch.\nCES Unveiled Las Vegas will be held Sunday, January 7, 2024\nFor more information, visit itri.org/eng or event.itri.org/CES2024.\nChad Cox.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

ITRI will also exhibit its smart sports innovations at CES Unveiled Las Vegas\u00a0booth 226, Shoreline Exhibit Hall, Mandalay Bay Convention Center.\nITRI is showcasing iGolfPutter, a smart sports technology designed for indoor golf training, at CES and CES Unveiled. This system offers a realistic simulation of playing on an outdoor golf course with key features including:\nBooth visitors at CES 2024 and CES Unveiled can virtually experience the feeling of putting on an actual golf course green, receive the putting results in real time, and obtain an analysis of their posture and putt.\nOther smart sports and digital health technologies on display include as follows:\niSwimWeaR\u00a0is a smart personal device designed to monitor physiological vitals in underwater environments. The device easily integrates with diving masks and swimming goggles without direct skin contact. Using low-power microwave sensing technology combined with a user-friendly smartphone app, iSwimWeaR tracks and displays underwater vitals including heartbeat, breathing rate, and activity levels in real time with a 95% accuracy rate. Unlike existing waterproof wearable devices that only transmit data once out of the water, iSwimWeaR tracks and monitors real-time diver or swimmer vitals while submerged. When the heartbeat or breathing rate drops too low, iSwimWeaR promptly sends visual safety alerts to the diver or swimmer and colleagues, effectively mitigating risks. iSwimWeaR also integrates ITRI's swimming posture analysis technology, which has the potential for professional training applications. Through the analysis of stroke frequency, stroke width, oblique angles, speed, and efficiency, the device provides recommendations for posture adjustments and training evaluations. In this application, iSwimWeaR enhances safety in beginner swimming lessons and elevates the overall training experience for athletes.\nMountain Watch\u00a0is an outdoor safety system that helps prevent hikers from getting lost or separated from their group. The system includes a smartphone app and a mesh network device. Even in mountainous areas with weak or no mobile phone signals, hikers can use Mountain Watch to update and share their real-time location with emergency coordinators, other hikers, family, and friends. Using ITRI's mesh network technology, the device features low power consumption, an extended communication range, and three-dimensional multipoint signal communication capabilities. These features enable the devices to serve as relay stations for one another through long-distance transmission. The device also features an emergency system that immediately sends emergency signals to other hikers in the vicinity. Hikers can also plan routes, navigate, and stay connected with family and friends through Mountain Watch.\nDeeGoo Digital Test & Training for Cognition Health\u00a0helps seniors assess the risk of dementia and stimulate cognitive functions, prompting them to seek medical attention for early diagnosis and treatment. As a user-friendly service, DeeGoo enables the aging community to take tests whenever convenient. DeeGoo tests can be completed within three minutes on any mobile device with an internet connection, which simplifies the assessment process compared to conventional paper-based tests. It gathers additional data unavailable through paper-based tests, such as response time and users' reactions to interactive tasks, providing doctors with a comprehensive data set for evaluation.DeeGoo is powered by a database that integrates published research and cognitive screening tools. Through AI analysis, posture recognition, and algorithms for both body and cognitive functions, DeeGoo offers personalized cognitive exercises to train performance in perception, attention, memory, executive function, language, and motor skills. By tracking patients' progress, DeeGoo has demonstrated a significant impact on delaying cognitive decline and improving overall cognitive health. ITRI collaborated with medical centers to develop DeeGoo through neurology clinical trials involving over 600 participants. To date, the service has accumulated over 20,000 test entries.\nBeatSync\u00a0is an AI-powered interactive music training device designed to relieve emotional stress and enhance mental health. Through button-press musical instruments with built-in pressure sensors, BeatSync captures details including the number of button presses, accuracy, timing errors, and pressing force. This data is analyzed to instantly display results, serving as a health assessment reference for either the user or caregiver. BeatSync can help users improve their mental health, relieve emotional stress, enhance cognition and memory, and refine brain-to-hand coordination. Furthermore, BeatSync recommends personalized music scores based on performance results as analyzed by AI, tailoring the training experience to individual needs. BeatSync is suitable for people of all ages spanning from toddlers to the elderly. ITRI has collaborated with schools, senior care facilities, and social welfare groups to further improve BeatSync, fostering better physical and mental well-being for all.\nITRI's smart sports and digital health technologies are making their U.S. debut at CES 2024.
