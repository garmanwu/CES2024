Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

        "raw_content": "Solar Tents and Windows, Battery on Wheels: Energy Tech From CES 2024\nHere's the best home energy technology we saw this year, from giant batteries to stained glass solar panels to machines that harvest water from thin air.\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nThe world convened at CES 2024\u00a0this past week to get its first look at the tech that could be coming to your home in the near future. Most, if not all, of the tech on display -- from the best of show to the wacky\u00a0to the cutting edge -- had one thing in common: electricity.\nWhile electricity keeps all your tech running, it's also more of a focus itself this year. There were more than enough solar-powered gadgets, portable power stations and visions for the future of energy to go around. If 2024 is the year you take control of your home's electricity, here's the tech we saw at CES that might help you do it.\nA whole home backup battery you can take with you\nEcoFlow had the Delta Pro Ultra loaded up on a cart at CES so you could wheel it around. It's surprisingly easy to move a battery that weighs nearly 200 pounds.\nThe variety of backup batteries has exploded over the last few years. Other companies have introduced their competitors to Tesla's well-known Powerwall battery, while the field of smaller, portable power stations is even more crowded. EcoFlow, a company that makes some of CNET's favorite portable power stations, introduced a new battery model that aims for the middle ground between portable and whole home backup.\nCan solar panels save you money?\nInterested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we\u2019ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings.\nWhen paired with its Smart Home Panel Pro 2, EcoFlow's Delta Pro Ultra power station can provide power to your home or be unplugged and wheeled away for energy on the go. EcoFlow touts an easier setup; you only need to have the smart panel professionally installed. Unlike most home backups, which are permanent, you can take the EcoFlow with you if you move. That can save you on installation costs and keep you from having to buy a new battery at your new place. It's another step toward more reliable and flexible energy use at home.\nA solar-powered rooftop tent\nJackery's rooftop tent solar panels are a dramatic-looking way to power a camping adventure.\nJackery, a company with plenty of portable power solutions, is looking to launch its most inventive product later this year. That's when you might be able to get your hands on\u00a0a popup tent with built-in solar panels that can be mounted to the top of a vehicle. Final specs and design are being hashed out, but a company spokesperson said the solar tent is likely to cost about $6,000 when it's available for purchase.\nJackery also had a solar-powered Mars rover on display (that it has no plans of sending to Mars) and an itty-bitty power station with a capacity of just under 100 watt-hours. That means Jackery's Explorer 100 just squeezes under the battery capacity limit for items you can take on a plane, the company told CNET. As a slightly nervous flier, I expect you might draw some extra attention at security.\nControl your home's power with the push of a button\nSavant's smart energy system allows you to switch your home from on-grid to off-grid with a tap.\nSavant\u00a0is one of several companies that gives you\u00a0insight into and control over how your home uses energy. Through sensors and controllers installed in your breaker box, Savant's system lets you see where power is flowing, from your solar panels, your battery or the grid. With\u00a0newly introduced features, controlling that flow is easier than ever.\nModes and scenes are customizable configurations of what's turned on or off in your house. Modes like \"eco mode\" prioritize using power from your solar panels, while \"storm watch\" ensures your battery is topped up in case of an outage. Scenes can be set to turn off all but necessary circuits when you're away from work or to power certain circuits during one season or another. Changing all that with the push of a button makes saving energy all that much more convenient.\nA power station with swappable batteries\nThe battery packs in the Bluetti AC180T portable power station are hot-swappable, so you can just take one of these things out of the station while it's operating.\nBluetti has made some of CNET's favorite portable energy products, like power stations and solar panels, since we've been testing them over the last few years. The company is at CES this year demonstrating a few concept products it's hoping to sell in the future.\nOne is a portable power station with a twist. Rather than one battery stuck inside the walls of the power station, the AC180T has battery packs you can swap in and out, while the power station is running your devices. This could make for even more flexible charging on the go. CNET's Jon Reed said swapping the batteries was \"weirdly fun to do.\" The AC180T has an energy storage capacity of 1,433 watt-hours (or about 1.4 kilowatt-hours.) Bluetti is planning to crowdfund the device's development with an Indiegogo campaign in February.\nIndoor solar cells with a ton of applications\nThis mechanical keyboard isn't powered by batteries or with a cord but via the solar cells on the right side of it.\nSolar cells that work indoors are not new. You might have used a calculator that powered up under your middle school's fluorescent lights.\u00a0Ambient Photonics' updated version delivers about three times the energy of those older models. This means they might be able to power things with a slightly higher appetite for energy: computer mice, TV remotes or anything else that might take AA or AAA batteries.\nPortable fridges gain new features and efficiency\nGoal Zero's Alta 50 portable refrigerator can supposedly run on just 8 watts of power once it's holding at temperature. That can last a long time on even a small power station.\nBluetti's swappable battery tech will be useful in other Bluetti devices, like the MultiCooler portable fridge. The fridge can keep things cool or downright frigid, from 68 to -4 degrees Fahrenheit. What's more, it has a built-in ice maker. Whether that's strictly necessary for a portable fridge is probably up for debate, but you can imagine the device making for some truly luxurious camping.\nOther portable fridges from another portable power stalwart were debuted by Goal Zero. The Alta fridges come in 50- and 80-liter capacities. The smaller version can maintain temperature using just 8 watts of power, once it's reached the targeted temp. That means that Goal Zero's smallest power station can run the fridge for over a day. Goal Zero introduced three new portable power stations and a home battery backup, joining the trend of other energy storage companies that started small, but are now offering larger, whole-home backup solutions at a more affordable price.\nStained glass that generates electricity\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nCES is great for finding odd, but cool little gadgets and the solar sector is no exception. Japanese solar company inQs is promoting its transparent solar technology with a range of solar-powered, see-through gadgets, including a silicon quartz crystal (pictured above) that can generate photovoltaic electricity. A company representative told CNET's Jon Reed its technology could also be deployed in windows, transparent or stained.\nBecause transparent solar tech is still emerging and not yet widely deployed, the challenge of recycling them doesn't loom as large as it does from the more traditional opaque, black or blue panels you see on roofs. Still, inQs says its tech, built on silicon quartz, is easier and safer to recycle and includes no rare earth materials.\nElectronics company Panasonic was also talking up see-through solar tech this year, namely perovskites. Perovskite solar technology is still largely in research and development (and not just by Panasonic) but could open up a wide variety of solar applications, like solar on windows and the side of buildings. Or, you can stick solar on solar: In labs, perovskite solar layered on top of silicon solar panels achieves much higher efficiency ratings than either technology can separately.\nA battery that can take a beating\nXing Mobility tested its battery cooling technology by driving three needles into the side of a battery pack. You can see where those cells blew up, but the rest of the pack looks alright.\nBatteries are a key element in the electrification of everything and the transformation of the power grid. Increasing their durability and safety, especially in settings like electric vehicles, could be an important way of stretching the resources needed to make them. CNET's Jon Reed saw battery cells from Xing Mobility that, when intentionally damaged, caught fire but quickly extinguished. That's thanks to a nonconductive, petroleum-based lubricant that extinguished the fire and cooled the battery off quickly. Most of the battery actually kept its charge. Batteries with this ability could be useful in cars and tractors and trucks, where they're more likely to get a little roughed up.\nA heat pump that can keep pace in the cold\nBosch says its new IDS Ultra cold-climate heat pump can meet a home's heating needs when the outside temperature drops as low as 5 degrees Fahrenheit.\nHeating and cooling a home is often its biggest energy-related expense. Heat pumps are the electric heating and cooling solution of the future as they are efficient and can be powered by clean energy sources. One ding against them is their performance in cold climates, although as the technology improves, heat pumps are performing better and better below zero.\nBosch's new heat pump, the IDS Ultra, is the company's first heat pump designed for cold-weather performance. Unveiled on the CES floor this year, the IDS Ultra can keep your house warm down to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (-15 degrees Celsius) and keep working down to -13 F (-25 C). The Bosch model joins others from companies like Daikin, Midea, Johnson Controls, Lennox International, Carrier, Trane and Rheem that have passed the first stage of the Department of Energy's Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge.\nMoisture farming in the 21st century\nThe Genesis Systems WaterCube is a big steel box that pulls water from the air.\nIt sounds like tech from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but you might soon be able to pull water right from the air. The WC-100 WaterCube from Genesis Systems is an 800-pound machine that can harvest 100 gallons of water per day at 80 degrees Fahrenheit and 50% humidity, although the company says it can work all the way down to below 10% humidity. It should get about 200 pounds lighter before it reaches the market, the company says.\nThe WC-100 WaterCube could be useful if your water supply is disrupted or to offset your water bill. You'd have to shave a lot of that water bill to recoup the cost, which sits at a hefty $20,000.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nSolar Installer Guides\nBest Solar Products and Companies\nSolar Installers by State\nSolar Installers & Storage\nSolar Resources and Guides\nOther Energy Saving Guides\nOther Types of Energy\nLiving Off the Grid Series\nUpdated Jan. 15, 2024\n6:00 a.m. PT\nWe thoroughly evaluate each company and product we review and ensure our stories meet our high editorial standards.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Five solar + energy storage trends to watch in 2024\nJose Colom, applications engineer manager with SMA America, forecasts the most compelling trends and developments he expects to see in 2024.\nAs the world continues its transition toward cleaner and more renewable energy sources, the trends in solar storage technology are poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of our energy infrastructure. Factors like federal legislation including the Inflation Reduction Act, net metering, government incentives, utility rate increases, and extreme weather are impacting the market in real time.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)\nThe IRA adds Section 48(a)(3)(A)(ix) to create an investment tax credit for standalone energy storage technology with a minimum capacity of 3 kWh. Energy storage technology includes batteries, but it also applies more broadly to any energy storage technology that receives, stores, and delivers energy for conversion to electricity, or to most technology that thermally stores energy.\nThe bill specifically addresses the Residential Clean Energy Credit for \u201cqualified battery storage technology expenditure.\u201d\nAdditionally, the IRA established the 45X MPTC and expanded the 48C ITC to support clean energy manufacturing, which has the potential to increase supply and lower the cost of solar and storage technologies. The 45X MPTC provides tax credits for clean energy components domestically produced, and the 48C ITC offers tax credits to purchase a property to build a manufacturing facility.\nState and utility incentives\nIn 2024, the solar storage market is poised for significant growth, largely driven by state government incentives aimed at fostering renewable energy adoption. These incentives will play a pivotal role in accelerating the transition to a more sustainable energy landscape.\nStates and utility companies across the United States are expected to continue rolling out a variety of programs, such as tax credits, and rebates making it increasingly attractive for homeowners and businesses to invest in solar storage systems.\nAs a result, the market can anticipate a surge in demand for energy storage solutions, not only for environmental reasons but also for the financial benefits that these incentives provide. This upswing in demand is expected to foster innovation in the solar storage industry, driving down costs and making renewable energy sources even more accessible to a wider range of consumers.\nState level net-metering reforms and utility rate increases\nState-level net metering policies can have a significant impact on the solar storage market. Net metering is a billing arrangement that allows solar system owners to receive credit for any excess electricity they generate and feed back into the grid. Policies that incentivize solar adoption offer fair compensation for excess energy. On the flip side, a change and increase in utility rate are significant for storage adoption.\nMarkets with the highest electricity prices and where utilities offer full retail rate credit for all solar energy exported to the grid see the highest solar PV adoption rates. Conversely, markets with the lowest electricity prices and value for solar export tend to have the lowest solar adoption rates. In some cases, utilities and regulators may respond to the growth of solar and storage by changing policies and rate structures (e.g., net metering reform, time of use, etc.). This can have both positive and negative effects on the solar storage market.\nTo put it in perspective, increased utility rates and time of use rate structure adoption have an impact on solar plus storage adoption rates. Recently passed net metering policies (e.g., NEM 3.0) may hinder the growth of solar adoption; still, high electricity rates and dynamic electricity pricing are expected to increase the energy storage adoption rate significantly. This is due to the economic advantage energy storage systems provide to solar PV owners who can store excess solar energy rather than export it to the grid at lower rates and then use the stored energy later rather than importing at retail rates.\nThis trend of higher storage attach rates and stand-alone storage will be even further boosted in markets adopting dynamic, time-of-use electricity pricing rates that incentivize off-peak consumption. These changes can drive greater demand for solar storage, leading to a more competitive market and making solar storage systems more accessible to a broader range of consumers.\nExtreme weather events\nExtreme weather events are poised to have a profound impact on the solar storage market. As climate change intensifies, the frequency and severity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, wildfires, and prolonged heatwaves, are on the rise. These events can disrupt the reliable operation of solar power systems, potentially causing damage to solar panels and related infrastructure.\nOn the flip side, they also highlight the crucial role of energy storage solutions. Battery storage systems can help mitigate the effects of intermittent solar generation caused by extreme weather by providing a reliable backup power source.\nAdditionally, the growing demand for resilience and grid stability is driving investments in advanced storage technologies and microgrid solutions, which are essential for ensuring uninterrupted energy supply in the face of extreme weather.\nThe solar storage market is not only adapting to these challenges but also stands to benefit from the increasing need for reliable energy storage in a changing climate landscape.\nInstaller education gap\nIn 2024, installers will address an education gap caused by shifts to energy storage from standalone PV. These installers, who have long been at the forefront of the renewable energy revolution, must adapt to the evolving landscape. To harness the full potential of solar energy, they must acquire the skills and knowledge necessary to sell, design, install, maintain, and optimize energy storage systems effectively.\nInstallers will need to help customers consider:\nThese forecasted factors working in tandem are expected to foster innovation in the solar storage industry, driving down costs and making renewable energy sources even more accessible to a wider range of consumers. As a result, 2024 holds great promise for the solar storage market.\nWhat\u2019s next?\nWith the mass adoption of storage systems, utilities and power producers would like to control the systems as one for grid services and to maximize revenue. This practice is known in the industry as the virtual power plant. The end user owns the system, but the utilities and power producers can control the battery assets.\nRecently, the industry has seen an increase in third-party platforms that connect different distributed energy resources to the energy markets to earn revenue and help support the grid. Ultimately, the storage system brings value to the customer and the utility companies.\nOur most popular series include:Power Forward! | A collaboration with BayWa r.e. to discuss higher level industry topics.The Buzz | Where we give our 2 cents per kWh on the residential solar market.The Pitch | Discussions with solar manufacturers about their new technology and ideas.\nShare:\nComments are closed here.\nOther Benjamin Media, Inc Brands: Compact Equipment | Trenchless Technology | Tunnel Business Magazine | Utility Contractor | Water Finance & Management\n\u00a92024 Copyright Solar Builder Magazine\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\u00a0\u00a0|\u00a0\u00a0 Wordpress Website by OuterBox"

The Greenworks PowerHub also can store energy from the utility grid during offpeak hours, which can be used during the most expensive peak hours in the mornings, evenings, and holidays. Here\u2019s what the press release had to say.\nThis clean energy solution, along with numerous other Greenworks \u00ae battery-powered innovations, will be on display at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas this week.\n\u201cOur PowerHub Home Energy Storage System can significantly reduce a household\u2019s carbon footprint, decrease electric bills, and provide power during a grid outage,\u201d says Klaus Hahn, President of Greenworks \u00ae North America. \u201cThis revolutionary system is a long-term investment that can increase the overall value of a home, plus the clean energy benefits everyone.\u201d\nA convenient app allows homeowners to manage the PowerHub from anywhere in real time. They can monitor consumption, backup power, charge/discharge levels, and more, from a PC or smartphone. In addition, they can set preferences to optimize for energy independence, outage protection or savings, and get instant alerts.\nThe flexible modular design is stackable and expandable for a home\u2019s growing energy needs. The easy-to-install, compact system doesn\u2019t require a lot of floor space; it can fit on a garage wall and leave enough space for a car.\nMany homeowners aren\u2019t aware that when the power goes down from the utility company, it is mandated to shut down a home\u2019s solar panels. This is necessary to keep from back-feeding power to the grid, which could be life-threatening to the utility line workers. The Greenworks\u00ae PowerHub will automatically disconnect a home from the grid and direct the solar power to the on-site battery to keep essential appliances running with zero interruption. Even if a home doesn\u2019t utilize solar panels, it can rely on hours of backup power during power outages. Typically, a home\u2019s solar panels generate more power than the home can use during the day; the PowerHub stores this surplus energy to be used when it\u2019s needed most.\nThe Greenworks \u00ae PowerHub Home Energy Storage System especially benefits homes that often experience power outages, such as coastal areas, wildfire-prone areas, and regions with planned power outages. Plus, some homeowners can participate in demand response programs and earn credits or payments from utility companies. In addition, some states grant a property tax exemption or other tax benefits to homes with solar energy solutions.\nWhat do you think? You may comment by using the social media buttons below.
