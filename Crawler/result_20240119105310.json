Reaching this accomplishment within the first months of its technology becoming widely available serves as further validation that Xandar Kardian's award-winning radar solutions represent a new option for patient monitoring, helping providers identify patients and residents at risk of deterioration.\nXandar Kardian's radar technology has helped improve patient care in skilled nursing and long-term care facilities by providing critical early deterioration detection, potentially improving the outcomes and bedside experience for both patients and providers. Xandar Kardian's patented, FDA 510(k)-cleared sensors are completely contact-free, with no wearables, patches or finger sensors needed and no staff intervention required for operation. The company's XK300 sensor measures macro (body motion), micro (respiratory rate) and nano (heart rate) vibration patterns that are constantly generated by our human bodies, and is capable of penetrating through objects like clothing, blankets and furniture. By monitoring for subtle changes in vital signs, Xandar Kardian can provide early indicators of a looming medical event, including acute illness, cardiac or respiratory failure, and even changes in underlying chronic conditions. This is all done without cameras or other recording devices, protecting the privacy of patients and residents.\nRadar technology company Xandar Kardian has achieved the milestone of 50 deployments with healthcare facility partners\n\"We've long believed that our best-in-class radar technology will completely transform the future of patient monitoring, and reaching the milestone of 50 facility partners is the strongest evidence yet that this transformation is fully underway,\" said Sam Yang, CEO and founder of Xandar Kardian. \"We take great pride in our technology's ability to proactively sense even the most subtle changes and abnormalities in patient condition, and the feedback that we've received from our partners about the positive experiences that their patients and staff are having by utilizing our XK300 reinforces our mission. We fully anticipate that we'll continue to scale rapidly and expand on this number significantly in the months ahead.\"\nIn addition to its impact on patient health, Xandar Kardian's technology has seen such growth and success in large part due to the opportunities that it delivers to healthcare facilities. Xandar Kardian's XK300 is inherently appealing to healthcare partners because it can seamlessly integrate into existing solutions for patient vital sign monitoring - and in some cases, overhaul them completely. XK300 typically collects 6000+ measurements a day, allowing caregivers to make decisions for patient treatment with full confidence, knowing that they are receiving reliable and accurate data in real-time. Xandar Kardian's technology can also be an essential resource for helping facilities navigate the healthcare industry's ongoing challenge of staffing shortages. Because the XK300 automates regular spot checks and can replace some in-person vital signs measurements, nurses' time can be utilized more efficiently, allowing them to spend more time on meaningful patient interactions, and less time on redundant tasks like constantly checking vitals. Non-contact monitoring means fewer chances of infection between patients and nurses, reducing cost expenditures on PPE and contamination mitigation. Xandar Kardian's technology can also be valuable in non-traditional healthcare applications such as remote patient monitoring (RPM) and hospital-at-home treatment programs, which, according to a recently published report, have grown by 300% since 2021.\nXandar Kardian's new website features all-new sections of case studies, clinical evidence, and resources showcasing the efficacy of Xandar Kardian's technology in healthcare settings and the built environment. To learn more about Xandar Kardian's technology and how the company's XK300 Autonomous Health Monitoring Solution can seamlessly integrate into your healthcare facility, as well as to see some examples of success stories from Xandar Kardian's existing partners, visit their website at www.xkcorp.com.\nAbout\u00a0Xandar KardianXandar Kardian is a US Delaware C-Corp, headquartered in Canada with international operations in Asia and North America, focused on deploying reliable and high accuracy security and healthcare solutions worldwide.

        "raw_content": "January 18, 2024\nCHECK THIS OUT\nXandar Kardian\u2019s Health Monitoring Radar Technology Earns FDA\nClearance\nXandar Kardian, the world\u2019s first and only commercially deployed, non-contact, continuous, and completely autonomous health monitoring solution utilizing proprietary radar technology, announced today that it\u2019s XK300 Autonomous Health Monitoring Solution has achieved 510(k) Clearance by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration, paving the way for a new era of accurate and reliable radar technology.\nDesigned for general ward (hospital) and senior nursing homes (including memory care), Xandar Kardian provides critical early deterioration detection in both hospital and home settings by taking continuous measurements of resting heart rate (RHR) and respiratory rate (RR) without intervention, providing invaluable insights along the way.\nHaving achieved FDA 510(k) Clearance, Xandar Kardian is granted marketing authorization for the XK300 Autonomous Health Monitoring Solution, showcasing heightened confidence in the product at a time where demand for radar technology is surging.\nSimple to use and designed to work on its own, Xandar Kardian uses radar technology to detect micro-vibrational frequency patterns being emitted from the body. The solution obtains a baseline RHR and RR by continuously tracking measurements over time, customizing a standard threshold based upon physician discretion and patient pre-conditions. Once the thresholds are engaged, the system can alert medical staff in emergent and non-emergent events via integrated nurse call systems, cloud-based mobile applications, or dashboard push alerts.\n\u201cSince 2011, our teams have been locked-in on perfecting digital radar signal processing solutions, providing a much-needed upgrade to current solutions in today\u2019s fast-paced, tech-savvy world,\u201d said Sam Yang, managing director of Xandar Kardian. \u201cWe are thrilled to share that after eight years of research and development, we have officially obtained FDA 510(k) Clearance, giving us the opportunity to share our robust, low-cost, revolutionary technology with the medical field, providing a groundbreaking technology that measures both resting heart rate and respiratory rates quickly and accurately.\u201d\nXandar Kardian\u2019s technology reduces both the physical and mental stress of conducting regular spot checks, with no staff intervention required. This form of non-contact monitoring means fewer chances of infection between patients and nurses, ideal in a post-COVID-19 era. Particularly useful for treating chronic respiratory disorders, Xandar Kardian\u2019s radar-based monitoring can provide valuable information on a patient\u2019s respiratory and cardiovascular health.\nThe XK300 qualifies for Medicare CPT Code 99454, alleviating all out-of-pocket patient costs, while the prescribing physician receives an average of $69 per month. In addition, the XK300 is also an essential tool for Neonatal units, vitally important considering the high incidence rate of respiratory diseases and distress in newborns and pre-term births.\nBeyond healthcare applications, Xandar Kardian is tremendously beneficial in smart building implementation, occupancy regulation, and providing an upgrade to the standard PIR motion sensor systems by discerning human presence in any given room, effectively powering down as soon as RR becomes undetectable.\nXandar Kardian\u2019s XK300 received significant validation at CES 2021 as a recipient of the CES Innovation Award, an annual competition honoring outstanding design and engineering in consumer technology products. The FDA 510(k) Clearance represents another milestone in bringing this essential technology to the mainstream.\nTo find more information on Xandar Kardian and the XK300 Autonomous Health Monitoring Solution, visit kardian.com.\nCorey Noles is the Managing Editor for Innovation & Tech Today.

        "raw_content": "Mission Statement: Empowering automation in digital healthcare to save lives and improve quality of life.\nEvery life is precious. We can all end up at the mercy of professional medical care at one point in our lives. What if we can offer some assistance to those professionals taking care of our health with technology? Xandar Kardian was created to focus on one part of the human body that can provide early indiciation of health deterioration: nano-vibrational data from heart beat, breathing and motion.\nThe journey began in 2011 when professor Sung Ho, James, Cho (Alumnus Award recipient from University of Utah and Electrical Engineering Professor for over 30 years at Hanyang University), gathered a group of Ph.D. signal processing engineers to push the limits on radar technology.\nThis resulted in over 24 peer-reviewed journal publications and dozens of patents. In 2016, Professor Cho met with a serial entrepreneur from Canada, Sam Yang, who spawned the vision of turning the research into a commercial product focused in proptech and healthcare. It certainly wasn\u2019t an easy journey. While many competitors utilized ready-made evaluation algorithms to go to market faster, Xandar Kardian decided to adhere to its principles and worked on becoming a medical device company by conducting numerous clinical trials and fine-tuning the system for several years. By April 2021, it wrote history by becoming the first commercially available FDA 510(k) cleared class II medical device to have both RHR and RR monitoring using radar.\nNow, a new journey begins. To achieve our mission, we are eager to work with hospitals, LTC facilities and telehealth companies and start deploying the solution.
