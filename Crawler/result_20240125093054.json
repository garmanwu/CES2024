A vibration in the headset on the right or left side will then guide you to change direction.\nThis is a more scalable solution for the millions of blind or visually impaired people, Lumen CEO Cornel Amariei told Euronews Next.\n\"If you look at what solutions are out there, you will actually only find two, and that is the white cane and the guide dog. They're both thousands of years old and unfortunately, the guide dog costs up to \u20ac60,000 to train,\" he said.\n\"But here's where we come in.

Almost 50 years ago, EssilorLuxottica removed the stigma of wearing prescription glasses by turning a necessary medical device into an iconic fashion accessory. Since then, the Company has reimagined what a pair of glasses can do for the person who wears them.\n\u201cThroughout our 10-year smart eyewear journey, we have honed our R&D, manufacturing, and distribution capabilities through several partnerships and product releases, including the recent introduction of Ray-Ban Meta. At CES, we will take our place among the world\u2019s leading innovators with a product, Nuance Audio, that has the potential to improve quality of life for over a billion people,\u201d said Francesco Milleri, Chairman and CEO at EssilorLuxottica.\nAt its booth (#8725) in CES\u2019s North Hall, the Company will showcase a prototype for Nuance Audio, a pair of beautiful glasses with advanced hearing technology built in seamlessly. Hearing solutions is an underpenetrated market where, similar to vision care decades ago, consumers are averse to wearing traditional corrective devices for a number of reasons including their visibility, discomfort and price.\nDesigned for consumers with mild to moderate hearing loss, Nuance Audio will eliminate the psychological barrier that has stood in the way of adoption of traditional hearing aids integrating proprietary state of-the-art open-ear hearing technology into fashionable eyeglasses. Nuance Audio is expected to launch in the market starting with North America in the second half of the year.\nThe EssilorLuxottica booth will also feature Ray-Ban Meta, its iconic Ray-Ban glasses with built-in cameras, open-ear audio, AI-powered solutions and the ability to livestream and take calls hands-free, as well as the Group\u2019s new HELIX division with Vision(X), an intelligent and interconnected platform that will help modernize eyecare practices offering a full range of innovative digital solutions including tele-optometry and big data services for the world of optics.\nNuance Audio, Ray-Ban Meta and HELIX are a testament to EssilorLuxottica\u2019s commitment to moving the eyewear industry forward into a new era of interconnected and AI-powered devices and solutions.\nAttachment\nAttachments"

This comes as OpenAI reportedly signaled it wants to raise billions of dollars in funding to build a network of chip fabs to supply enough AI accelerators to meet its needs. With the Facebook empire looking to vacuum up more than a third of a million Nvidia GPUs alone, we can see why the ChatGPT house is super keen on more factories to churn out processors. Zuck\u2019s boffins are right now training Llama 3, their latest content-generating large language model, and plan on releasing it openly, the billionaire confirmed Thursday via Instagram. Under Zuckerberg\u2019s vision, Meta\u2019s Fundamental AI Research and Generative AI teams will work more closely together to develop core capabilities needed to achieve artificial general intelligence, or AGI. \u201cIt\u2019s become clear that the next generation of services requires building full general intelligence, building the best AI assistants, AIs for creators, AIs for businesses and more needs advances in every area, from reasoning to planning to coding to memory and other cognitive abilities,\u201d he said. Zuckerberg is the latest CEO to throw his hat in the ring in the race to build AGI, a theoretical technology that can outperform humans in many cognitive tasks. Training increasingly powerful models needed for AGI to become more than a pipe dream requires huge amounts of accelerators, and Zuckerberg said Meta intends to amass 350,000 H100s for the task. That\u2019s not all: Meta will reportedly use other types of chips to achieve a total computing power equivalent to 600,000 H100s using a variety of GPUs. It\u2019s even working on its own AI silicon . Unlike some other orgs pursuing AGI, Meta is planning to openly share its efforts and has vowed to release its models for other developers to use. And Zuckerberg hasn\u2019t quite turned his back on that whole Metaverse and VR headset thing. Instead, he opined AGI will help build and fill out the project\u2019s interconnected worlds of 3D virtual reality, as the corporation has previously indicated when asked whether the CEO has given up on it in favor of artificial intelligence. \u201cPeople are also going to need new devices for AI and this brings together AI and the Metaverse over time. I think a lot of us are going to talk to AIs frequently throughout the day. And I think a lot of us are going to do that using glasses. Glasses are the ideal form factor for letting an AI see what you see and hear what you hear,\u201d he predicted. Last year, Meta launched Ray-Ban smart glasses in partnership with eyewear conglomerate EssilorLuxottica, which each contain a camera, speaker, and microphone. For $299, wearers can activate and chat with an AI assistant, and Zuck claimed they were off to a \u201cvery strong start.\u201d \u00ae\nEssilorLuxottica Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)\nWhen was EssilorLuxottica founded?\nEssilorLuxottica was founded in 2018.\nWhere is EssilorLuxottica's headquarters?\nEssilorLuxottica's headquarters is located at 147 rue de Paris, Charenton-le-Pont.\nWhat is EssilorLuxottica's latest funding round?\nEssilorLuxottica's latest funding round is PIPE - II.\nWho are the investors of EssilorLuxottica?\nInvestors of EssilorLuxottica include Bpifrance and Third Point.\nWho are EssilorLuxottica's competitors?\nCompetitors of EssilorLuxottica include Neso Brands and 1 more.\nLoading...\nCompare EssilorLuxottica to Competitors\nKering Eyewear is a luxury eyewear company operating in the fashion and jewelry industry.

        "raw_content": "Fashion Briefing: EssilorLuxottica introduces hearing-device-equipped glasses at CES\nThis week a look at how fashion got involved in technology conference CES. Scroll down to use Glossy+ Comments, giving the Glossy+ community the opportunity to join discussions around industry topics.\nFashion industry attendees at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES), held in Las Vegas from January 9-12, included EssilorLuxottica, Walmart, Perfect Corp, Virtual Brands Group and UX AI company Pre AI, the latter of which recently worked with Bally.\n\u201cThis year, CES is a lagging indicator of the macro trends that have carried over from last year,\u201d said attendee Michael J. Miraflor, vc at venture capital firm Hannah Grey. \u201cThe economic state from last year, combined with a lot of experiential, marketing and UX people being laid off, has definitely affected the experience here at CES. The conversations are a lot more practical.\u201d\nFor its part, luxury and mass-market eyewear company EssilorLuxottica, which owns Ray-Ban and Oakley, as well as eyewear licensing for brands including Coach and Armani, presented smart eyewear and hearing aid technology. In the first nine months of 2023, the group\u2019s revenue totaled \u20ac19.15 billion, or about $21 billion.\nThe highlight of the Group\u2019s debut at CES was the unveiling of Nuance Audio, an eyewear prototype featuring integrated hearing technology. The Group started exploring ways to combine audio and eyewear 18 months ago, and it acquired Israeli company Nuance Hearing in late 2022 as one of its first steps in reaching the goal. The deal was estimated to be worth tens of millions of dollars.\nThe glasses, which look like a standard pair of modern glasses, feature hidden microphones across the frame and others toward the temples, as well as speakers in the arms. The volume of the glasses can be adjusted for various settings and can be controlled through the glasses themselves, an app or a compact remote. Equipped with a quick charging feature, the glasses take 2.5 hours to fully charge, which can be done through a wireless charging pad.\u00a0Once charged, the glasses can be used for almost a full day.\nThe glasses will be available in two models \u2014 one more square and one more rounded \u2014\u00a0with each offered in three sizes and two colors, black and burgundy. The company plans to make them available over the counter in the U.S. by the end of 2024. Due to regulatory differences, a European rollout won\u2019t happen until 2025. Although EssilorLuxottica declined to share the price, D\u2019Alena said the glasses will be priced at about a quarter of standard hearing aid prices in the U.S., which average $4,600, so about $1,150. The models will be released under the new brand Nuance Audio, with EssilorLuxottica owning the rights to the technology and being able to license it out to other brands.\nAimed at individuals with mild to moderate hearing loss, the glasses aim to overcome the stigma often associated with traditional hearing aids. \u201cToday, there are 1.6 billion people in the world with a hearing impairment,\u201d said Davide D\u2019Alena, global head of marketing for Nuance Audio, quoting World Health Organization February 2023 research. \u201cThis number will go up to 2.5 billion by 2050. There is going to be this big increase because of usage and attitudes, with the new generation playing more video games, music and movies.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cOut of that 1.6 billion, there are 400 million people who have a moderate to severe to profound hearing loss, which is the main target for the traditional hearing aid industry.\u201d As such, the real opportunity for the glasses is the remaining 1.2 billion people with mild to moderate hearing loss who are not being served today.\n\u201cThere is still a strong stigma surrounding the hearing industry, as there probably was 50 years ago for eyeglasses or vision correction,\u201d said D\u2019Alena. \u201cPeople don\u2019t want to wear traditional hearing aids. There is a strong association that if you\u2019re wearing traditional hearing aids, you are old or you have some deficiency.\u201d\nWhat\u2019s more, he said, getting a hearing aid is typically a long and cumbersome process involving an appointment with an audiologist and fittings. With Nuance Audio\u2019s glasses, however, someone can set up their hearing aid in one minute, he said.\nEssilorLuxottica may eventually opt to equip eyewear styles by its various brands with the Nuance Audio technology, but that is \u201cnot in the plans, for now,\u201d said D\u2019Alena.\nAccording to EssilorLuxottica, a few hundred people tried on the product at its CES booth.\n\u201c[The technology] is very impressive because it is invisible,\u201d Miraflor. \u201cIt continues the trend that we\u2019ve seen year over year at CES where brands are making a concerted effort on the engineering and design side to make their technology blend into the background or not be so obvious.\u201d\nHe added, \u201cAesthetically, it is maybe one of the best examples on the show floor of truly useful technology being integrated into an everyday object in a way that is fashionable. \u2026 This is opening people up to the idea of spatial computing.\u201d\nIn addition to the Nuance Audio frames, EssilorLuxottica showcased its Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses, equipped with built-in cameras, open-ear audio, AI-driven features, and capabilities for hands-free calls and livestreaming. The re-designed glasses, first introduced as Ray-Ban Stories in September 2021, were released in September 2023 and come in two styles, the Wayfair and the Headliner, in a variety of lens and color options.\n\u201cThis is the first wearable that Meta has launched with Meta AI deeply integrated with the product,\u201d said Janelle Tong, product manager at Meta. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen incredible use cases around it, with everything from information gathering to creativity.\u201d\nIn the U.S. in December, Meta launched an Early Access program for 100 customers who signed up online to beta-test uses of its multimodal AI.\n\u201cPeople wearing the Meta AI glasses have been able to [leverage AI] by saying, \u2018Look and tell me what I\u2019m looking at,\u2019 or, \u2018Look and tell me what this says in English,\u2019 or, \u2018Tell me what style or color this matches,\u2019\u201d said Tong. \u201cThrough this really easy access with multimodal, you will be able to understand how to match outfits better or better understand the world around you. Meta AI is something that we\u2019re continuously updating over time, on a monthly release cadence \u2014\u00a0for everything from making things feel more natural to other insights like capturing audio.\u201d\nAccording to EssilorLuxottica, a few thousand CES attendees tried on the Meta x Ray-Ban glasses.\nFinally, EssilorLuxottica also introduced its Helix division supporting doctors. It operates Vision(X), a digital platform aimed at helping the optometry industry with operations and customer interactions through digital tools, including tele-optometry and data services.\nHow will AI change how fashion thinks about product value?\nAnother big conversation among fashion companies at CES was about AI. With generative AI image and text tools moving from hype to testing stages, attendees vocalized concern about the effect on the value of fashion products over the next few years.\n\u201cThe concern I have with AI that \u2014 is in a world where everybody can create everything at any time, at zero cost and almost instantaneously \u2014 how do you retain value in products?,\u201d said Justin Hochberg, CEO of virtual products company Virtual Brands Group, which counts Forever 21 among clients. \u201cDoes that mean logos, like Gucci and LVMH use, have to become more dominant? How do you retain brand equity in a world where you know the product can be easily replicable? That\u2019s the question mark.\u201d\nLuxury products and those leveraging craftsman may prove winners. \u201cSophisticated consumers will come to care about that human in the loop as much as they care about things like sustainability,\u201d said Miraflor. \u201cIt will be a new consideration that people will incorporate into their buying decisions.\u201d\nInside our coverage\nAuthentic Brands Group continues licensing strategy with Sperry acquisition\nHow Alo Yoga is using its Q4 learnings to power its 2024 SMS marketing strategy\nCalifornia\u2019s PFAS regulation brings a reckoning for the fashion industry\nWant to discuss this with our editors and members?

In July, Paul du Saillant, the company\u2019s deputy CEO, outlined plans to expand the portfolio beyond sight by pairing \u201chearing solutions and prescription glasses.\u201d The goal, du Saillant said in a statement, was to \u201cremove the stigma of traditional hearing solutions.\u201d\nThe company presented the product intended to achieve that goal last week at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The product looks like a typical pair of prescription glasses.\u00a0According to CNET, the glasses feature microphones, speakers and algorithms to enhance the hearing of the wearer. The focus is on enabling the wearer to better hear the person they are talking to by amplifying the voice of the person who the wearer is facing.\nEssilorLuxottica plans to launch the glasses starting in North America in the second half of the year and is yet to disclose the price publicly. The company is entering a market targeted by hearing specialists and tech companies, some of which were attracted by the growth opportunities created by new Food and Drug Administration rules allowing over-the-counter sales of hearing aids for people with mild- to moderate-hearing loss.\nSome of those rival companies have rethought the design of hearing aids, favoring products that look like in-ear headphones over the traditional, behind-the-ear style, but they still require people to wear an additional, visible device.\nRecommended Reading\nMedTech Dive news delivered to your inbox\nGet the free daily newsletter read by industry experts\nEditors' picks\nRoundup: Cyber incidents, vulnerabilities hit the medtech sector in 2023\nFrom vulnerable medical devices to a breach that took some of Henry Schein\u2019s systems offline, cybersecurity was a key topic for the industry this year.\nRoundup: Illumina\u2019s long goodbye to cancer test maker Grail\nFrom the start, the DNA sequencing leader faced pressure to unwind its $8 billion acquisition of the cancer screening developer.

Around 1,400 different start-ups vied for attention alongside established brands, old and new, an indication of how hardware has become the new software.\nVoyage MagSafe charger by Native Union\nWhether or not this means there\u2019s a bubble in need of bursting is another matter. The current trend for injecting AI into everything from cars to dog wellbeing products shows the breadth of enthusiasm for the technology, even if its actual aims and benefits are harder to discern. Likewise, the domestic robotics industry is still waiting for its killer app.\nHP Spectre Fold Laptop\nThis year, there was even a \u2018Gallery of Flops\u2019, a self-referential Salon des Refus\u00e9s of commercially catastrophic ideas. Although most of the featured products were little more than tiny bumps in the road for major corporations (the Microsoft Zune, Amazon\u2019s Fire Phone, the Nintendo Virtual Boy), start-ups see shows like CES as very much a life or death situation. We\u2019ve already reported from CES 2024 to delve into the car industry\u2019s many and varied takes on tomorrow\u2019s tech, as well as the fast-growing beauty tech market. Scroll down to see our broader selection of the ideas and products that caught our eye, from wearables to smart mirrors, laptops and loudspeakers.\nCES 2024: New tech for the home of tomorrow\nSamsung Robot Vacuum Cleaner\nScrub up: Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo\nRobotic vacuum cleaners have been a staple of tech shows for decades and are still the most successful and practical kind of domestic droid. If you\u2019ve the right kind of space (open and uncluttered), then devices like Samsung\u2019s new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo are a perfect match. The ubiquitous AI features include the ability to detect different flooring types and switch between scrubbing, sweeping and sucking depending on the surface, as well as a stain-detecting system. If the little puck-like Bot finds a dubious mark, it\u2019ll scuttle back to its clean station to heat its spinning mop pads and then return to tackle the problem.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, available soon, Samsung.com\nAirthings Renew\nIt's a breeze: Renew air purifier by Airthings\nQuiet and unimposing, just as you\u2019d hope, the new Airthings Renew air purifier is perfect for bedrooms and home offices. The compact grey cube was designed in Norway and has the power to filter out up to 99.7 per cent of fine airborne particles. It also syncs with the Airthings app to help you track, trace and clean up the quality of your indoor air.\nAirthings Renew air purifier, \u00a3349.99, Airthings.com\nAnura MagicMirror from NuraLogix\nLooking glass: Anura MagicMirror\nDesigned to works in harmony with the Canadian company\u2019s Anura app, which apparently provides \u2018medical-grade measurements using data gathered from a 30-second video selfie\u2019, the MagicMirror is a digital fit-check for your mental state. Meditech companies often claim far-reaching diagnostic capabilities, but if it works, the rectangular mirror requires you to sit still and gaze into its 21.5-inch screen; beneath the surface are AI-powered sensors that\u2019ll run a report on your vital signs.\nAnura MagicMirror, concept only, Nuralogix.ai\nBMind Smart Mirror from Baracoda\nMirror, mirror on the wall: BMind Smart Mirror from Baracoda\nMore about mindfulness than raw analytics, the BMind Smart Mirror is intended to give you a lift, not probe your inner workings. More AI is at play, sifting through a database of expressions and gestures to get a sense of how you appear to be and respond with light, sound and projected display. Described as an \u2018AI-driven virtual mindfulness coach\u2019, it\u2019s a fairytale device brought to life.\nBaracoda BMind Smart Mirror, concept only, Baracoda.com\nLG\u2019s Smart Home AI agent\nSmart bot: LG Smart Home AI Agent\nLG\u2019s Labs division crammed a lot of smart home devices into its CES 2024 display, including its Bon Voyage camping trailer. This little robot was also on show, intended as an AI-driven companion that also serves as a security guard and pet monitor. With the ability to detect faces and parse speech, the nameless bot is friendly enough for the home but could also serve as an all-round mobile monitoring station for a workplace.\nLG Smart Home AI Agent, concept only, LG.com\nPersonal tech: new devices for a data-heavy lifestyle\nSony XR Headset\nSensory immersion: Sony XR Headset\nWith Apple\u2019s Vision Pro poised for launch, Sony is one of many competitors hoping to get in on the augmented reality bandwagon. The XR Headset features twin 4K OLED microdisplays as well the see-through functionality offered by the Vision Pro. An array of six cameras and sensors help guide you through physical space, while control systems include a wearable ring and a pointing controller. Although aimed primarily at product designers and architects, the applications are potentially limitless.\nSony XR Headset, price and availability tbc, Sony.net\nLotus Ring\nWielding control: Lotus Ring\nMicro-wearables are a burgeoning market. Lotus\u2019 Ring is perhaps the simplest of the lot. This finger-borne controller doesn\u2019t monitor or measure; it simply controls. Using the same infrared technology as a traditional television remote control, users need to install special light-switch covers. After this, they can simply point at the switch to turn it on or off. Rather than see this as a contemporary version of the Clapper, the company is pitching the Ring as an accessibility aid.\nLotus Ring, GetLotus.com\nCreator Keyboard by Clicks\nSmart phones: Creator Keyboard by Clicks\nThe Creator Keyboard from Clicks urges you to step back into the distant days of the Blackberry. Essentially an iPhone case with a built-in physical backlit keyboard, the Creator should find favour with anyone who has never quite got the hang of touchscreens, as well as the retro crowd. The bold BumbleBee yellow is the colour of choice if you want to be noticed.\nCreator Keyboard, from $139, Clicks.tech\nRabbit R1 Smart assistant\nHop to it: Rabbit R1 Smart assistant\nRabbit\u2019s R1 caused quite a stir. Designed in collaboration with Teenage Engineering, the little orange device is intended to supplement your cellphone, providing a way of completing tasks without having to hunt through apps and search screens. How does it work? The Rabbit is a portal to your existing online, app-driven services. Using the Rabbit Hole website, you assign control of your relevant accounts to the pocket-sized square box. From then on, onboard ChatGPT-powered AI (naturally) awaits your command (activated by the push-to-talk button) and will complete your spoken request. An upcoming \u2018learn\u2019 mode will let you school the Rabbit on the errands you want to automate.\nRabbit R1, from $199 plus subscription, Rabbit.tech\nVoyage by Native Union\nPocket power: Voyage MagSafe charger by Native Union\nVoyage is the simplest of devices from Paris-based Native Union, coming soon as part of the company\u2019s new product line-up. An ultra-slim MagSafe charger, the folding, pocketable device opens up to allow you to charge two of the following at once: an iPhone, AirPods or Apple Watch. When not in use, the Voyage snaps together into a circular form factor that\u2019s perfect for travelling.\nVoyage, price tbc, NativeUnion.com\nUltraHuman Home\nInfo source: UltraHuman Home hub\nThe Ultrahuman Home is a domestic dock for the company\u2019s Ring AIR, a wearable health monitor system. While the Ring AIR can track movement and sleep, the Home adds environmental data, including light and air quality, noise levels, temperature and humidity. The company\u2019s systems can parse and process data from both sources, suggesting ways to make your living space more amenable to a healthier life.\nUltrahuman Home, available soon, Ultrahuman.com\nNuance Audio glasses from EssilorLuxottica\nHearware: Nuance Audio glasses from EssilorLuxottica\nEssilorLuxottica\u2019s portfolio includes just about every eyewear maker you\u2019ve ever heard of.

Aimed at both demanding leisure users wanting to experience the very latest in graphical sophistication and creatives who need power for processing images, video and music, the new ROG Zephyrus machines are available in two sizes, the G14 and G16. The larger G16 has space for up to 4TB of storage and both incorporate laptop graphic processors from NVIDIA and OLED screens. We especially appreciate the slim cases and sober styling.\nROG Zephyrus laptops, ROG.asus.com\nHP Spectre Fold laptop by HP\nYour flexible friend: HP Spectre Fold by HP\nThe Spectre Fold is HP\u2019s new flagship, with a price tag to match. This multifunctional computer attempts to the best of every world, combining tablet, laptop and desktop in a single, slender package. The folding 17-inch screen wraps around the neat wireless keyboard; it can be detached to use on its own as a large touchscreen tablet. Dock the keyboard on the lower screen and the Spectre Fold looks like a conventional laptop. Slide the keyboard down to uncover a portion of the lower screen and you have an additional information display and touch point. Alternatively, you can set the screen up as a freestanding display (with built-in stand), transforming the whole outfit into a desktop computer.\nHP Spectre Fold By HP, \u00a34,999, HP.com\nLenovo Yoga Pro 9i laptop\nPower move: Lenovo Yoga Pro 9i laptop\nLenovo unveiled more machines in its long-running Yoga series of laptops.

The District bike is also available as a Scrambler model for those intent on using it off-road.\nDistrict Street, from \u00a35,615, LandMoto.io\nSegway Xyber\nPedal power: Segway Xyber E-bike\nBilled as an off-road Sport Performance E-bike, Segway\u2019s new Xyber is the very thin end of the e-bike wedge. Pedals mean you can power it yourself, but the main focus is a chunky frame, solid off-road tyres, full-suspension and a high-speed motor with an emphasis on acceleration and torque.\nSegway Xyber, more information at eBike.Segway.com\nParkie Parking Robot from HL Mando\nPark assist: Parkie Parking Robot from HL Mando\nParkie is a robot with a singular purpose: to park cars.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

The world leader in eyewear and lenses and home to brands like Ray-Ban, revealed its Nuance Audio glasses that can help those with \u2018mild to moderate\u2019 hearing loss. This wearable tech product looks set to be a life-changing product for many... and at just 1/5th the cost of regular hearing aids.\nThe glasses weigh just 40g and come in two styles with invisible \u2018advanced hearing\u2019 technology built into the frames. The volume is controlled via the glasses, an app, or a small remote and can be adjusted for each environment. The unit takes only 2.5 hours to fully charge via a wireless charging pad.\nWhen released later this year, Nuance Audio could seriously disrupt the hearing aid market as it will attract those who resist traditional hearing aids for their obtrusive design and lack of comfort. The engineering feat of pulling this product off is impressive, as the proximity between a hearing device's mic and speakers creates feedback, making audio optimization quite difficult. However, our digital therapeutics expert co-founder attests that they have nailed it.\nPart of the secret sauce is in spatial awareness and directional control. The direction the glasses point is where the audio is sourced from, drowning out any peripheral noise, a major issue with other hearing solutions. This innovation could majorly improve the livelihoods of seniors (and others) with hearing loss.\nIn the future, Essilor hopes to build in more tech like blood pressure, body temperature, and posture sensors, so the glasses eventually act more like an all-encompassing health monitor. Finally, we wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they add support for AI tools like chatbots, vision recognition, or connected data retrieval, given Essilor\u2019s existing partnership with Meta on AI-powered Ray Bans. Reach out to us if you want to try Nuance Audio early: partnerships@thetech.buzz.\n\"I've seen a lot of people crying when they tried the glasses as they were completely disconnected from the world before, because for years they couldn\u2019t even hear birds, for example.\"\nStefano Genco, Global Head of Super Audio and Nuance Audio at EssilorLuxottica.\nShare the Tech Buzz\nCareer Hive\nThis section will feature job opportunities from across the tech sector.
