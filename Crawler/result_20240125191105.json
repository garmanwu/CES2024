All content can be viewed, accessed, and shared between these devices. Plus, it provides automatic secure AES 256 encrypted key backup through our proprietary iOS APP for an iPhone or iPad.\nNow, with the extended 100W power rating, it will expand the compatibility of the iXCharger's charging capability to many of the higher power consuming gaming laptops that require up to 100W of electricity. On top of that, offering 100W and two separate USB-C connections, means the user can power up 2 separate devices while allowing one of the devices access to the iXCharger's internal memory. The iXCharger's power can be allocated as a single device up to 100W or two separate devices with up to 65W devoted to a laptop/large tablet and up to 30W devoted to a second device, like a smartphone.\nThe 100W iXCharger's two USB-C connections can accommodate both a USB-C to Lightning cable and/or a USB-C to USB-C cable, meaning the iXCharger is compatible with iPhone and iPads using a Lightning connection as well as the latest iPhone 15 series that uses a USB-C connection. Even though the iPhone 15 emphasizes that it can directly connect to any USB connected storage device, that functionality is very limited in scope only giving access to the Files feature and allowing users to direct film in a specific mode. It doesn't allow access to any other files, including to backup the photos and videos. Whereas, the iXCharger can access the iPhone's Photos App along with many other App options and features that are not available to non-MFi devices..\n\"It's commonplace today to carry multiple computing devices with you, such as a laptop or tablet and a smartphone, whether it be for business or pleasure,\" exclaims Ryan Swerdloff, Vice President of Vinpower, Inc. \"The 100W 2 USB-C iXCharger makes it more convenient and more efficient to allow those users to charge both devices at the same time and access the added storage from the iXCharger on one of the devices. In today's fast paced world where content is king, the iXCharger will become the crown of the industry.\"\nAll of the iXCharger options are compliant with the current EU USB-C mandate, and further reduces unnecessary waste by reducing the burden of redundancy to a single compact device that can act as both an energy efficient power charger and a large capacity backup storage solution for a wide range of mobile devices and laptop computers, including Apple iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows laptops, ChromeOS, and many other similar devices. Thus, the iXCharger reduces e-waste, creating an ESG environmentally conscious universal 2-in-1 solution for both charging and secure backup and storage.\nBoth the Innovation Award Honoree 65W and the upcoming 100W iXCharger will be shown at CES 2024 in Vinpower's exhibition, located in Central Hall, booth # 16646.\nLatest Reviews\nLatest Headlines"

All content can be viewed, accessed,\nand shared between these devices. Plus, it provides automatic\nsecure AES 256 encrypted key backup through our proprietary iOS APP\nfor an iPhone or iPad.\nNow, with the extended 100W power rating, it will expand the\ncompatibility of the iXCharger's charging capability to many of the\nhigher power consuming gaming laptops that require up to 100W of\nelectricity. On top of that, offering 100W and two separate USB-C\nconnections, means the user can power up 2 separate devices while\nallowing one of the devices access to the iXCharger's internal\nmemory. The iXCharger's power can be allocated as a single device\nup to 100W or two separate devices with up to 65W devoted to a\nlaptop/large tablet and up to 30W devoted to a second device, like\na smartphone.\nThe 100W iXCharger's two USB-C connections can accommodate both\na USB-C to Lightning cable and/or a USB-C to USB-C cable, meaning\nthe iXCharger is compatible with iPhone and iPads using a Lightning\nconnection as well as the latest iPhone 15 series that uses a USB-C\nconnection. Even though the iPhone 15 emphasizes that it can\ndirectly connect to any USB connected storage device, that\nfunctionality is very limited in scope only giving access to the\nFiles feature and allowing users to direct film in a specific mode.\nIt doesn't allow access to any other files, including to backup the\nphotos and videos. Whereas, the iXCharger can access the iPhone's\nPhotos App along with many other App options and features that are\nnot available to non-MFi devices..\n\"It's commonplace today to carry multiple computing devices with\nyou, such as a laptop or tablet and a smartphone, whether it be for\nbusiness or pleasure,\" exclaims Ryan\nSwerdloff, Vice President of Vinpower, Inc. \"The 100W 2\nUSB-C iXCharger makes it more convenient and more efficient to\nallow those users to charge both devices at the same time and\naccess the added storage from the iXCharger on one of the devices.\nIn today's fast paced world where content is king, the iXCharger\nwill become the crown of the industry.\"\nAll of the iXCharger options are compliant with the current EU\nUSB-C mandate, and further reduces unnecessary waste by reducing\nthe burden of redundancy to a single compact device that can act as\nboth an energy efficient power charger and a large capacity backup\nstorage solution for a wide range of mobile devices and laptop\ncomputers, including Apple iOS, Android, MacOS, Windows laptops,\nChromeOS, and many other similar devices. Thus, the iXCharger\nreduces e-waste, creating an ESG environmentally conscious\nuniversal 2-in-1 solution for both charging and secure backup and\nstorage.\nBoth the Innovation Award Honoree 65W and the upcoming 100W\niXCharger will be shown at CES 2024 in Vinpower's exhibition,\nlocated in Central Hall, booth # 16646.\nAbout Vinpower, Inc.\nVinpower is an award-winning leading developer of digital\nstorage and backup, cross platform power + storage, mobile Apps, as\nwell as optical disc, flash, and HDD/SSD duplication equipment and\nmedia.
