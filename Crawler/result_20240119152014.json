They are approved for domestic and international use by leading regulatory bodies and telecommunication network service providers.\nOur approach provides a framework and best practices to guide your success across the development value chain, including:\nReference Hardware Architectures\nWe offer over 20 years of experience and a comprehensive range of custom IoT services to meet the demands of your customers or use cases. Whether you are bringing a new solution to market or are seeking to increase your existing design\u2019s performance and value, we can help.\nWe create fully customized solutions to your specifications. Each solution is optimized with the best available technology. Our custom IoT solution resources include proven reference architectures that are easily tuned and modified. You can get to market faster while still delivering a highly tailored product or service.\nBluetooth Beacon Device Architectures\nOur Bluetooth\u00ae beacon architectures are ideal for asset tracking at scale due to their attractive low-cost, high-value profile. These small hardware devices constantly transmit Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) signals. Bluetooth-enabled devices like IoT gateways can scan these signals, which makes the data available to the user on demand via the cloud.\nCommon applications and verticals include:\nBattery-Operated Tracker/Gateway Device Architectures\nTracking and monitoring the location and condition of non-powered assets will require a battery-operated device. Our reference architectures can accommodate various battery types (i.e., rechargeable, field-replaceable and disposable) and offer a wide range of lifespans (from weeks to years) depending on application and reporting interval. Adding Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or other network capabilities allow the powered device to act as a gateway that can harvest location and condition data from multiple sensor nodes.\nCommon applications include:\nDC-Powered Tracker/Gateway Device Architectures\nWhen tracking or monitoring assets that have an engine or onboard power supply, a powered asset tracking device is recommended. We designed our reference architectures to function if power is lost or interrupted. They have a battery that can last up to two years without power. Adding Bluetooth, Wi-Fi or other network capabilities allow the powered device to act as a gateway that can harvest location and condition data from multiple sensor nodes.\nPowered asset trackers are great for applications including:\nCellular LTE Module Security\nSecurity is native to our hardware and designed into the industrialization process, which hardens our modules to cyberattacks. Our IoT modules are secured and personalized at the time of manufacture, enabling our IoT endpoints to leverage the security benefits.\nModules with certain chipsets feature encrypted ID, credentials and SIM functions embedded in the chip\u2019s trusted zone. The Telit ID (TID), which is injected into the module at the point of manufacture, is immutable and cannot be moved from one module to another.\nThe TID is used for tracking and auditing modules across different systems. Its identity information is shared securely only through our IoT platform for device management.\nIoT Device and Connectivity Management\nWith our IoT modules, connectivity and platforms, we build customized, ready-to-launch solutions that are verified and certified. Get one-touch access to your global connectivity network with our IoT connectivity plans and management solutions. Our IoT device and connectivity tools and resources efficiently get your deployment to market, regardless of scale or stage.\nWith our tools, you get:\ndeviceWISE\u00ae IIoT Platform\ndeviceWISE, powered by Telit Cinterion, lets you connect your machines and enterprise software without writing custom code. This platform leverages the power of a logic engine and hundreds of native machine protocols and drivers. Once implemented, you can get near real-time bidirectional data and analysis from any machine, sensor or device. Discover how deviceWISE can help you scale and future-proof your IIoT solution.\nGet Started with Our Custom IoT Services\nSpeak with our IoT experts to explore our custom IoT solution services."
