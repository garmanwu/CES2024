        "raw_content": "The Next Wave of Beauty Tech Just Dropped at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 in Las Vegas has once again emerged as a hub for revolutionary beauty technology, unveiling a spectrum of innovative devices poised to catapult our routines into the realm of futuristic luxury a la Judy Jetson. Notable among these launches are a multifunctional showerhead that serves as a face and body cleanser, a state-of-the-art lip tool and a strand-protecting blow dryer. These cutting-edge gadgets signify a shift towards a future that amplifies our self-care regimen. Here\u2019s a glimpse of the upcoming innovations set to grace our vanities before the robots take over.\n1. Elevating In-Shower Self-Care\nKohler is breaking into the beauty space big time with a number of offerings that are set to keep us in the bathroom longer. Our favorite is SpaViva, a multi-functional handshower that seamlessly combines innovative Kohler sprays with an all-in-one face and cleansing device. Featuring two spray types, a Katalyst and Microbubble spray, the device ensures a thorough and gentle cleanse. The interchangeable attachments include a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager.\nAlfred Richardson, Kohler\u2019s director of channel marketing and commercialization says, \u201cIt introduces a unique environment of wellness and beauty into the shower. It underscores the idea that you can enjoy these spa-like activities in the comfort of your home without the need to always visit a spa.\u201d The SpaViva is equipped with an extendable handle, magnetic docking and a rechargeable battery offering a 90-minute run time.\n2. The Future of Lip Care\nAmorepacific\u2019s Lipcure Beam clinched the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Digital Health category, marking the company\u2019s fifth consecutive victory. This all-in-one device not only identifies lip concerns but also provides treatment and leaves a custom tinted hue. The cap\u2019s precision sensor diagnoses lip conditions, while the brush-like applicator emits visible light to enhance lip care. The light-responsive material augments collagen fibers, establishing a moisturizing barrier on the lips.\nByung-Fhy Suh, head of Amorepacific R&I Center says, \u201cWe are profoundly honored that Amorepacific\u2019s renowned strengths in skin biotechnology and our dedicated research and development in customer-centric technology have led to us winning our fifth consecutive CES Innovation Award.\u201d\n3. Harnessing Light to Dry Hair\nL\u2019Oreal introduced the AirLight Pro, developed in collaboration with Zuvi, the brand behind the eco-friendly Halo tool. This professional-grade dryer utilizes infrared light and high-speed wind to dry surface water on strands, while retaining internal moisture. As a result, it leaves the hair up to 33 percent more hydrated while consuming 31 percent less energy. The dryer features a 17-blade, high-speed motor, and infrared technology, providing rapid drying without resorting to excessive heat. Barbara Lavernos, deputy CEO of L\u2019Oreal says, \u201cAirLight Pro perfectly encapsulates this beauty breakthrough by introducing a solution that not only dries hair but also cares for both the hair and the planet for the first time.\u201d\n4. Skin-Perfecting Tech\nThis year, APR brought their Medicube line of anti-aging tools from South Korea to CES for the first time. The company debuted its latest innovation, the Medicube Age-R Booster Pro, which launched oversees last October. Since its release abroad, the device has been a coveted for its ability to treat a variety of skin concerns and improve radiance, elasticity and tone and texture.\nThe Age-R Booster Pro uses electroporation technology and controlled lighting to treat skin. \u201cThrough this exhibition, we aim to establish APR\u2019s name as a leading beauty tech company in the global market and leave a lasting impression on consumers worldwide,\u201d says Kim Byung Hoon, CEO of APR. The device also connects to the Medicube Age-R app and offers personalized routines with remote control and automatic reporting features.\nAs beauty and technology continues to intertwine, these new devices showcase the industry\u2019s commitment to enhancing beauty rituals through cutting-edge advancements.\nRelated Posts\nIt's Personal\nAt NewBeauty, we get the most trusted information from the beauty authority delivered right to your inbox\nFind a NewBeauty \"Top Beauty Doctor\" Near you\nSign Up\nGet trusted information from the beauty authority delivered right to your inbox\nGlobal Headquarters"

We highlight a selection of the beauty tech innovations launching at the exhibition, including an infrared-powered hairdryer from L'Or\u00e9al and a lip care device developed by Amorepacific.\nAirLight Pro by L'Or\u00e9al\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al introduced AirLight Pro, a hairdryer that uses patented infrared technology rather than heating coils to cut down on energy use and dry the hair without inducing heat damage. Developed with Zuvi, a hardware start-up specialized in haircare technology, AirLight Pro features 17 propeller blades and is said to offer 30% faster drying time. The hairdryer targets hair salon professionals, who can customize its settings to each customer thanks to the accompanying app. L\u2019Or\u00e9al CEO Nicolas Hieronimus took to the stage on day one at CES 2024 to deliver a keynote on how the company is developing accessible and inclusive beauty tech.\nAmorepacific looks to lips with Lipcure Beam\nAmorepacific\u00a0scooped a CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Digital Health category for Lipcure Beam, a beauty tech device that leverages patented technology to combine lip diagnosis, care, and make-up capabilities. A precision sensor in the tool's cap can detect moisture levels when applied to the lips and provide a skin diagnosis. Removing the cap from the container reveals a brush-like applicator that emits customized visible light based on the diagnostic results. Amorepacific developed a light-responsive material that interacts with this light when applied to the lips, in order to boost the response of the natural vitamin riboflavin to strengthen collagen fibers and form a moisturizing barrier. Designed for ease-of-use and portability, the device can be operated with one hand and also uses a universal color system.\nINOOCQ's solution for product authentification\nWith identiDOTS, French start-up INOOCQ enables beauty and luxury brands and consumers to easily identify counterfeit products. Augmented inks and biocompatible quantum markers are integrated into product formulas and primary or secondary packaging: scanning the products reveals whether the product is genuine by detecting these markers.\nBeautigloo keeps cosmetics cool with LITE fridge\nFrench company Beautigloo is presenting new beauty massage tools and its LITE beauty fridge at CES 2024. Made in France, the LITE fridge claims to extend the shelf life of cosmetics and enhance their performance. It features a silent, patented cooling system that maintains an optimal 50\u00b0F temperature with no humidity. Beautigloo was founded in 2017. It has been part of L\u2019Or\u00e9al and LVMH accelerators at Paris\u2019 Station F, and its customers include Dior and Shiseido.\nNimble Beauty's at-home nail salon\nNimble Beauty is showcasing a \"smart at-home nail salon\". The device leverages AI and complex robotics to scan, paint and dry nails. Nails are mapped with 270\u00b0 nail-scanning technology, with more than 20 algorithms used to calculate the dose of polish, while painting is done via a fine-motor robotic arm that imitates human motion on five axes. The object projects air to dry each coat. The polish capsules feature a propriety packaging design meaning that they work only with the Nimble device. Some 33 shades of the vegan formulas are available.\nPerfect Corp expands AI and AR offer\nAugmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) beauty tech solutions provider Perfect Corp is showing its latest AR and AI innovations across beauty, skin, fashion and generative AI.

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nJudging from L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s first-ever keynote address at CES 2024, beauty tech is big business. The U.S. beauty market alone is valued at $77 billion \u2014 and with the growing popularity of tech-powered skincare companies such as NuFace, Lyma, Therabody, CurrentBody and others, it\u2019s no surprise that the tech expo is becoming a launchpad for innovation in beauty tools and accessories.\nRelated Stories\nLana Del Rey Channels Old Hollywood Screen Sirens in Skims' New Valentine's Day Campaign\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Is Available for Pre-Order: Here's When the New Smartphone Starts Shipping\nAt this year\u2019s tech expo, we spotted everything from portable tattoo printers to L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s own buzzy launches (the Colorsonic hair-dyeing brush and the infrared light-powered Zuvi AirLight Pro hair dryer), and even some veritable competition for Dyson\u2019s best-selling hairstyling tools.\nWe also found plenty of great-in-theory concepts, like an oxygen mask-like prototype for treating acne to an AI-powered manicure machine that seemed to need some fine-tuning during its demo. Ahead, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the best beauty finds from CES 2024 that are worth buying (or keeping your eyes on) \u2014 see our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Fashion & Beauty\nDreame AirStyle High-Speed Styler\nAt $299, the soon-to-launch Dreame AirStyle is one of the best affordable hair multi-stylers we\u2019ve seen \u2014 and we expect it to compete with the beloved Dyson Airwrap, which costs twice the price.During our hands-on demo at CES, the hair tool base felt as light \u2014 if not lighter \u2014 than the Airwrap, and even lighter and easier to use than the Shark FlexStyle (the current top-selling Dyson hair tool competitor right now). It offered many of the same features as both the Dyson and Shark hair tools: three speed settings and a cold shot button for setting hairstyles.Accessories include two curlers (clockwise and counterclockwise) that look and feel similar to Dyson\u2019s 1.2-inch barrels, a flyaway tool, a round volumizer brush, a smoothing brush and a hair smoother. It also has a removable filter cover and automatic temperature monitoring. While testing the hair styler at CES, we found that the curling barrels wrapped hair as seamlessly as our Airwrap at home. The final test: bringing our newly-styled tresses \u2014 finished by Dreame\u2019s on-site hairstylist with a spritz of hair spray \u2014 back to the hotel room to see how well our strands held their shape the next morning. After (literally) sleeping on the results, we can confidently say that Dreame\u2019s AirStyle is poised to be the next big thing in the world of Airwrap alternatives. It\u2019s slated to hit the market this summer at\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and Dreame\u2019s website.

At CES 2024, we saw Imprintu\u2019s pocket-sized device in action and nearly expected the \u201ctattooist\u201d to declare, \u201cAbracadabra!\u201d Made to last about a day (our body art stood the test of 24 hours in Vegas), the tattoos looked vibrant and clear on our olive-tone skin. Imprintu says the device can also be used to print designs on clothing, too.\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Colorsonic Hair Brush\nAfter being announced at CES 2022, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s groundbreaking Colorsonic was finally unveiled \u2014 with the help of actress and brand ambassador Eva Longoria \u2014 at CES 2024 during the company\u2019s first-ever keynote at the tech showcase. The magic wand-like hair-dying brush uses color cartridges to make it easier \u2013 and stain-free \u2014 to color tresses or touch up roots.One cartridge can be applied to a full head or be used for three root retouches. Unfinished cartridges can also be saved in the device to be used later. Initially, there will be 20 hydrating shades available in formulas free of ammonia, parabens, phthalates, SLS, SLES and silicones.The L\u2019Or\u00e9al Colorsonic will launch this spring.\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al x Zuvi AirLight Pro Hair Dryer\nWe\u2019re already fans of Zuvi\u2018s Halo hair dryer, which uses the company\u2019s revolutionary LightCare technology to prevent heat damage on tresses or an overheated scalp by using infrared light instead of heat \u2014 a process so innovative that CES 2024 keynote speaker L\u2019Or\u00e9al became a strategic investor of the brand. The result of their partnership is the professional-grade AirLight Pro, which L\u2019Or\u00e9al says uses 31 percent less energy than other hair dryers and delivers up to 33 percent more hydrated hair and up to 59 percent smoother-looking strands. The Zuvi AirLight Pro hair dryer will launch under L\u2019Or\u00e9al Professionel later this year to both consumers and beauty professionals.\nBeautigloo Beauty Refrigerator\nCold storage isn\u2019t news in the beauty world, but LVMH- and L\u2019Or\u00e9al-backed French company Beautigloo offers a better way to organize your skin-care (and without the gimmicky mini-fridge silhouette) with its new Lite Refrigerated Beauty Box, which has a built-in thermostat, customizable compartments and a roomy interior that allows you to store bottles upright. Featuring a 5-liter capacity (a larger size is available), the beauty refrigerator uses a silent cooling system and keeps products at the ideal temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit for preserving ingredients and extending shelf-life. (The Paris-based startup says that Dior and Shiseido are among clients.)\nPanasonic Palm Shaver\nGrooming on the go just got easier with Panasonic\u2019s Palm Shaver, a pocket-friendly device equipped with a five-blade system for smooth, close shaves for all beard textures. We love that the tool is made from sea mineral-derived Nagori, a sustainable material that Panasonic says helps reduce plastic usage by 40 percent compared to conventional grooming products. The tool will launch in September.\nAmore Pacific Lipcure Beam\nA winner of the CES 2024 Innovation Award in Digital Health, Korean beauty giant Amore Pacific\u2019s Lipcure Beam is a pout care multi-tasker that diagnoses, plumps and applies lip makeup. Using a specially formulated gel-like material (which is applied to the lips) that responds to light exposure, the three-in-one applicator senses and treats lip concerns by activating riboflavin, a natural vitamin, to \u201cstrengthen the collagen fibers in the lips\u201d to form a moisturizing barrier. No word yet on the release date, but beauty lovers will likely want to stay tuned on this kisser care and tinting device.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nPrince Harry Pulls Libel Claim Against British Tabloid Mail on Sunday\nEvents of the Week: \u2018Vanderpump Rules,\u2019 \u2018Law & Order: SVU\u2019 and More\nCritics Choice Red Carpet Winners Revealed: Margot Robbie\u2019s $2.5M Balmain Look, Charles Melton in Valentino\nRambling Reporter: Selena Gomez Can\u2019t Stop Quitting Instagram\nThe Gamble of Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Career (Exclusive Excerpt)\nCara Delevingne, South Korean Model Xu Meen Make a Case for Digital Nomad Style in MCM\u2019s New Campaign\nMost Popular\nMeghan Markle & Prince Harry Are Reportedly 'Shocked' Over the Controversy Surrounding Daughter Lilibet's Name\nThe Egyptian Government Bulldozed an Iconic Cairo Art Center With \u2018Millions\u2019 in Art Inside\nKobe-Inspired Mamba Foundation Amasses Cash but Spends Little\nMo'Nique Blames Oprah For Taraji P.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nInnovations in beauty tech for 2024, from robot-powered nail art to AI-enhanced make-up\nInnovations in beauty tech took centre stage at CES 2024. Laura Feinstein reports for Wallpaper* on a selection of key trends to follow\nInnovations in beauty tech are taking centre stage in 2024, as proven at this year\u2018s annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the largest industry event of its kind. Here, thousands descended on Las Vegas to learn exactly what might be in store when it comes to the future of beauty and grooming. And, while AI and machine learning were the buzziest terms of 2023, judging by the many gadgets and products on display, tech is set to have an even bigger and more radical impact over the months ahead. Devices unveiled at CES 2024 range from algorithm-driven skin enhancements to at-home robots that seek to replace regular nail salon visits, tools that colour hair at the push of a button, and luxury storage systems developed with LVMH.\nInnovations in beauty tech for 2024, from robot-powered nail art to AI-enhanced make-up\nThe neuro-responsive scent\nScientists and researchers say scent recognition is one of our most potent cognitive tools, and putting this idea to the test is YSL Beauty\u2018s Scent-Sation, which utilises a multi-sensor EEG-based headset to gauge neural responses to luxury fragrances. An honoree for best Wearable Technology in CES 2024\u2019s Innovation Awards, the device allows you to craft their ideal scents by completing a questionnaire tied to a series of smell tests, with users given fragrance recommendations based on positive emotional responses.\nThe high-tech haircare\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Coloursonic can transform hair colour at the push of a button\nGrowing research suggests that the standard blow dryer is problematic for both the environment and hair health. At CES, L\u2018Oreal demonstrated an infrared-powered hairdryer, the AirLight Pro, which uses energy-efficient heating coils to dry strands while minimising heat damage. Developed with hardware start-up Zuvi, creator of the revolutionary Halo hairdryer, the device features 17 propeller blades and offers faster drying time, leaving hair more hydrated while consuming less energy. The brand also unveiled its Coloursonic at-home hair dyeing wand, which can seamlessly mix and distribute salon-quality formulas at the push of a button. On the more experimental side, Korea\u2018s Becon.ai introduced the Scalp Scanner \u2013 which promises to be the future in preventing hair loss and seeks to encourage overall scalp nutrition \u2013 while Myavana offered at-home AI-driven strand testing with personalised scientific analysis and recommendations.\nThe AI and AR make-up\nThe Amorepacific Lipcure Beam was an honoree in the CES 2024 Innovation Awards for Digital Health\nThe Amorepacific Lipcure Beam \u2013 a CES 2024 Innovation Award honoree for Digital Health, for its patented technology combining lip care with customised make-up \u2013 is akin to a handheld beauty consultant. The device works via a precision sensor in the tool\u2018s cap to detect moisture levels and skin condition when grazed over lips. The applicator then utilises a brush that emits a high-tech \u2018visible light\u2018 based on diagnostic results, projecting light-activated material that boosts natural collagen, forms a moisturising barrier, and creates a custom hue. The brand also unveiled COSMECHIP, an at-home device that curates custom skincare, and Color Master by TONEWORK, which uses AI and \u2018precision colour analysis\u2018 to recommend make-up shades based on skin tone and texture.\nThe luxury beauty storage\nThe Beautygloo cosmetics fridge has been developed in Paris with LVMH and counts Dior Beauty and Shiseido as customers\nFrench brand Beautygloo hopes to extend the shelf life of your favourite products and fragrances with a revamped cosmetics fridge with a patented cooling system to maintain optimal preservation temperatures, all while eliminating humidity. The start-up\u2019s product was developed in Paris as part of an LVMH accelerator programme, and current Beautygloo customers include Dior and Shiseido. In the coming year, the brand seeks to make headway in the US market.\nThe robot-enhanced nail and brow treatments\nThe Nimble Beauty at home nail salon uses AI and robotics to paint and dry nails like a professional artist\nA standout at CES 2024, Nimble Beauty\u2018s \u2018smart at-home nail salon\u2018 makes use of AI and robotics to paint and dry professional-quality nails in 33 vegan shades, using nail-scanning technology. Nails are inserted into a device similar to a typical gel manicure kit. Then, they are mapped by more than 20 algorithms that calculate exact polish needs, while painting is done via a robotic arm programmed to mimic human motions. Shu Uemura also hopes to replace your next salon appointment with its newly unveiled SHU: BROW, an at-home electronic eyebrow make-up applicator. Built with the help of Prinker, a pioneer in the temporary body ink space, the device offers bespoke, tech-enabled brow shaping tailored to a user\u2018s exact face dimensions.\nThe new skincare devices\nThe Armani Beauty METAPROFILER is a handheld face sculpting device that analysis skin\nFans of Armani Beauty can look forward to the brand\u2018s META PROFILER, a handheld face sculpting and massaging device equipped with cutting-edge technology that is able to analyse skin with a combination of 18 LEDs. Three capture modes are also able to identify texture, smoothness and even levels of hydration. Working in this space alongside Armani Beauty is cult Korean skincare favourite Medicube, which announced plans to bring its popular Booster Pro (a facial tool designed to amplify radiance and elasticity through microcurrents and light therapy) to global audiences later this year.\nThe bathroom of the future\nThe Kohler Anthem+ Digital Control system is part of the \u2018bathroom of the future\u2018 alongside its Atmo Bathroom Fan\nKohler is entering into hackable bathrooms in a big way with its range of new smart home products. Coming soon, the Anthem+ Digital Control system can power almost any bathroom from a single control panel, equipping showers with the ability to regulate flow and temperature and adding steam through a touch display that syncs with the Kohler Konnect app. The SpaViva, another addition to the collection, is a multi-functional hand shower that combines an all-in-one face and body cleansing device with interchangeable brushes, massagers, and pulsing sprays. As part of this \u2018bathroom of the future\u2018, Kohler will also release the programmable Atmo Bathroom Fan later this year, which uses sensors to modify temperature and doubles as a light, automatically coming to life when too much moisture is present.\nWallpaper* Newsletter\nReceive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox\nLaura\u00a0Feinstein\u00a0is Kickstarter\u2019s Senior Design & Tech Editor.

(Further reading: Designing Inclusively: a Primer.)\nIn addition, Nimble will exhibit what is touted as the \"first smart at-home nail salon.\"\nMeanwhile, Amorepacific's Lipcure Beam technology has been honored with the CES 2024 Innovation Award. The\u00a0device reportedly combines lip diagnosis, care and makeup capabilities in one unit.\nIts cap houses a\u00a0 sensor capable of diagnosing the condition of the lips, including moisture levels. The cap can be removed to reveal a brush-like makeup applicator that deposits a light-responsive material to the lips and a customized visible light that can, in combination with the material, boost\u00a0the response of riboflavin.\nThis reaction between the light and the deposited material reportedly strengthens the collagen fibers inside the lips, forming a moisturizing barrier on the surface. The result is slowed lip aging, per Amorepacific.\nThe design supports one-handed application and \"employs a universal color system naturally suited for all races and ages.\"\nByung-Fhy Suh, head of Amorepacific's R&I center, said, \"We are profoundly honored that Amorepacific's renowned strengths in skin biotechnology and our dedicated research and development in customer-centric technology have led to us winning our fifth consecutive CES Innovation Award. The R&I center at Amorepacific will continue to exert extensive efforts, ensuring every customer achieves a satisfying life through their unique beauty and health.\""

A nine-time CES Innovation Award honoree, L'Or\u00e9al's keynote will demonstrate how the company's ongoing technology transformation ensures that it remains prepared for a future of its business that is at once physical, digital and virtual.\nL'Or\u00e9al CEO Nicolas Hieronimus will deliver the first-ever keynote from a beauty company at CES\u00ae 2024.\nL'Or\u00e9al's keynote will showcase the role that sustainable, accessible and inclusive beauty tech plays in driving positive impact at an individual and collective level, from a sustainable showerhead that leverages rocket technology to conserve water and AI-powered mobile applications that provide skincare guidance to augmented reality makeup try-ons and new codes and forms of beauty expression in virtual environments. L'Or\u00e9al knows that technology, powered by advanced data and AI capabilities, is an essential tool for creating powerful new connections and experiences for its consumers by solving their long-standing beauty challenges and offering them limitless tools for discovery, self-expression and personalization.\n\"Beauty is a timeless pursuit and technology adds to its enjoyment while unlocking a world of possibilities,\" said Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO, L'Or\u00e9al Groupe. \"The first wave of beauty tech changed how people discover, evaluate and buy beauty products.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news.

They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Astounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nThe world's biggest consumer tech show lets us dream of a Jetsons-style world where these futuristic concepts come to pass.\nLooking to the future\nCES 2024 is a candy-colored box of goodies. While you can certainly buy some of the wares at the show, some of the most intriguing tech concepts trumpeted at CES are visions of the future we wish were already real. (Others were straight-up wacky.) Here's what's sparking our imagination.\nTalking, color-changing BMW\nRemember KITT, the talking car from Knight Rider? It's getting closer to reality thanks to Dee, a talking, color-changing BMW concept car displayed at CES. It will listen and respond to commands from curbside, as well as remotely via a smartphone app. Plus, the concept's exterior skin is covered with new full-color E Ink technology that can instantly shift between up to 32 colors, allowing you to generate patterns and multicolor schemes on the fly to customize your ride.\nSelf-service airport screening pods\nAirport security lines are never fun, and they can be so long they result in travelers missing their flights. Thankfully, the Transportation Security Administration is testing a new self-service system that could let you complete the screening process on your own. The self-service screening pods are for TSA PreCheck passengers to use as individual screening consoles. When a passenger steps inside the screening pod, they show their ID and the machine will begin scanning them and their bags. Each station includes a video monitor with step-by-step instructions. The prototype that's being shown at CES this week is the Micro-X self-screening system.\nJackery solar Mars bot and rooftop camper\nJackery displayed two concept items -- one more practical than the other. The company showed off a \"Mars rover\" with solar panels. The Solar Generator Mars Bot is like a portable power station on wheels with solar panels sliding out of the sides to capture more sunlight, somewhat like NASA's Opportunity Rover, with power outlets. And a more practical item on display was the company's rooftop camper tent. Solar panels mounted inside the hardshell roof of the pop-up tent and extending wings of panels can provide power through one of the company's power stations, running plenty of camping equipment for long journeys.\nKia's Lego-like concept vehicles\nKia debuted three concept vehicles at CES 2024: the PV1, PV5 and PV7, the automaker's new Platform Beyond Vehicle family. They are electric vans that can be customized to move products, serve as work or living spaces, be converted to modular pop-up stores, and operate with or without a driver behind the wheel. Think Legos for vehicles -- they can be reconfigured almost at will.\nHyundai's steering tech\nThe Hyundai Mobion concept vehicle moves unlike any other vehicle you've probably seen. The newly developed eCorner steering technology uses advances in robotics technology to allow the vehicle to move laterally, rotationally, and do all sorts of crazy things. The wheels can be moved independently, but also in multiple different configurations. The car can even crab walk, and it can do rear-wheel steering on a level that we've almost never seen before. Hyundai hopes to begin shopping the tech around in 2025 or so.\nQuantum dot-powered TV of the future\nNanosys has created a prototype 12.3-inch nanoLED screen that could be thinner, brighter and more efficient than OLED. What's nanoLED, you ask? It's a technology based on electroluminescent, aka \"direct-view\" quantum dots, and its screens boast improved picture quality, energy savings and manufacturing efficiency. While the screens can't quite be made in TV size yet, the new prototypes are big enough for tablets, small laptops and automotive uses.\nHyundai's electric air taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the CES debut of the Supernal S-A2. Hyundai's advanced air mobility wing Supernal displayed its new, second-generation S-A2, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, air taxi. It'll take to the air as early as 2028, the company said.\nDoublepoint Android watch software\nA Finnish startup created some impressive software, called Doublepoint, that turns your smartwatch running Android's WatchOS into a kind of remote control you can wear on your wrist.\nIt makes your watch a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection. You may be able to dim your lights, scroll Netflix or do any number of other things.\nHisense projector concept car\nHisense doesn't make cars, but the company is demonstrating its laser TV in-car technology at CES. CNET's\u00a0David Katzmaier calls it\u00a0\"basically a drive-in movie theater built into your car.\" There's a laser projector right on the front bumper -- you could project a movie straight from your car onto a flat surface, like your garage door. Inside the car, you can turn the windshield into an information hub, allowing drivers to simultaneously observe virtual images and the real environment.\nSamsung transparent micro-LED\nTransparent OLED\u00a0and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, but Samsung says its micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the going tech. That means you should be able to see through it more easily to objects on the other side.\nOne intriguing use: One day, you could be in a luxury box at an athletic event or concert looking through this transparent micro-LED glass. Scores, replays and highlights could appear on the \"windows\" and augment the experience of the game without obscuring it. (You're still on your own for getting those luxury box tickets, however.)\nSamsung's flip phone concept\nSamsung's Flex In & Out Flip concept is like a Galaxy Z Flip you can fold in both directions. Unlike the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and other flip phones you can buy today, it folds completely backward so that you use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nLG DukeBox\nIf you've ever wanted to sync up The Wizard of Oz with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, the LG DukeBox might be just the device for you. It's a 360-degree speaker with a transparent OLED panel at the front to show off the tube amplifier inside. LG says the screen can be used to watch movies or \"create a cozy fireplace ambiance where the vacuum tube is visible amidst the flickering flames.\"\nLG concept car\nLG has a car? It's just a concept for now, but this futuristic beauty features completely autonomous driving, seats that turn completely around, and of course, plenty of screens.

The new solar technology, perovskite, uses different materials than traditional silicon solar panels. The fact that the materials are printed onto walls and windows means Panasonic can manufacture components at much lower temperatures -- which saves energy -- and the solar cells themselves have the potential to one day capture as much energy as traditional solar panels, if not more.\nHonda 0 Series Saloon\nHonda gave CES attendees their first peek at its next generation of battery electric cars, the Honda 0 (pronounced \"zero\") series, expected to launch in the US in 2026.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 - gen AI adds to L'Or\u00e9al's digital transformation in the beauty tech revolution\nYou may wonder why we're discussing beauty at CES.\nThe question was purely rhetorical from Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of global beauty brand L'Or\u00e9al as he opened the company\u2019s keynote address at the Consumer Electronics Show jamboree in Las Vegas. In practice, the main pitch was was for a piece of consumer electronics that can be found in every home - a new hairdryer, this one a smart device that uses infrared and wind to use less energy.\nThat\u2019s fair enough, but as diginomica has observed over the years, L'Or\u00e9al has been one of the prime movers for digital transformation in the highly competitive beauty sector for quite some time.\nAs Hieronimus pointed out to CES delegates:\nMore than 10 years ago, we actively engaged in a digital revolution at L'Or\u00e9al, which allowed us to pave the way and become leaders in digital and e-commerce. More recently, we've seen a huge transformation in tech with disruptive technologies that you know very well, such as Web 3.0, cloud, IoT, AI and, of course, generative AI changing the world around us and disrupting business models across many different industries.\nThis technophilia has had consequences for enterprise strategy, he went on:\nAs a result, in 2018, we decided to embark the entire company on a second revolution to become the undisputed leader in beauty tech.\nTransformative\nL'Or\u00e9al is uniquely positioned to achieve this, he argued:\nAfter over a century solely dedicated to beauty, we have the world's richest database concerning all aspects of beauty from skin and hair knowledge to formulation science and beauty routines, to connecting with our consumers across our 37 international brands, across all beauty categories, in all\u00a0 channels. We already own 10 petabytes of data on our L'Or\u00e9al data platform, supporting all types of AI models, including the latest LLMs [Large Language Models].\nWe've already seen firsthand the transformative power of tech. Tech is helping us form stronger relationships with our consumers, understand them better, and astonish them with trailblazing innovation. Tech is also helping us to empower consumers with elevated services and augment their beauty journeys and experiences at scale. Beauty experiences that are inclusive, that flourish in humanity's infinite diversity and empower every individual to express who they are and who they want to be and to do the experiences that are inspiring and always one step ahead ahead, whether is introducing new cutting edge formulas, AR power, diagnostics, augmenting beauty devices, or developing new ways of bringing beauty, health and wellbeing to people around the world.\n[These are] beauty experiences that are respectful and which prioritize sustainability, safety and quality to ensure we can make a positive impact on people's lives while preserving preserving the beauty of the planets to be true to our purpose to create the beauty that moves the world. And of course, experiences that respect the highest standards in ethics and data privacy.\u00a0 The end result is beauty for each powered, or dare I say, augmented by tech designed to anticipate and answer consumers expectations and desire with the best of creativity, science and technology.\nAI incoming\nBeauty product consumers have a particular problem, Hieronimus noted - too much choice:\nI have to admit that many consumers have a hard time finding the right products, 70% of them feeling overwhelmed by the number of choices available, so they ask friends, watch videos and search online to try and make sense of the sheer number of products on store shelves. They have a decision paralysis that L'Or\u00e9al, thanks to beauty tech, has found the perfect solution to. We have created the perfect beauty advisor wherever you want and wherever you are.\nIn other words, here comes the compulsory generative AI pitch! This particular iteration takes the form of the L'Or\u00e9al Paris Beauty Genius, a virtual personal beauty advisor. This is not a chatbot, insisted Hieronimus, but rather \u201ca fully personalized AI-engine, an AI-powered solution based on an individual in-depth diagnosis\u201d.\nBarbara Lavernos, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s Deputy CEO in charge of Research, Innovation and Technology, expanded on this definition:\nThe Beauty Genius will act like a personal beauty advisor, available 24/7 in your pocket. It can also help answers questions about your beauty routines and even sensitive topics without having to speak to a real person, such as acne, dandruff, or hair loss. It can also help guide people through these challenging issues and avoid uncomfortable or intimidating situations like recently my own son Max was facing acne issues.\nBehind the seamless experience, it's powered by a combination of the most cutting-edge gen AI, augmented reality, computer vision and color science. We have integrated more than 10 different LLMs and a very sophisticated architecture to get the most personalized beauty routines adapted to each individual. The Beauty Genius is capable of providing personalized diagnostic of both skin and skin tone.\nYou can also virtually try the product before you buy them. Over the last decade, we have propelled this technology to the highest level of accuracy. It has been trained on an inclusive dataset of over 6,000 images and tested by makeup artists on more than 10,000 product in 50 countries and it is protected by more than 10 patents. When it comes to our skin diagnosis, our algorithms have been trained on over 180,000 dermatologists.\nIt\u2019s the amount of underlying real world data that makes the difference, she concluded:\nThe level of accuracy proves that we have built diagnostics that transcend just a tool for product sales, and gathered data that can truly bring the best prescription for every person. To elevate the user experience, we analyze hundreds of 1000s of real life conversation between consumers, our own consumer care lines and beauty advisors in stores. As a result, it feels like you're having a real conversation with a genuine beauty expert and not just a faceless algorithm. And despite the sophistication of the tech, there is no latency truly making it a seamless experience for people.\nMy take\nAt L'Or\u00e9al, we believe that tech can push the boundaries of what's possible, help us improve the lives of consumers around the world and cater to the infinite diversity of beauty needs and aspirations of every individual. We used to promise beauty for all; thanks to tech, we want to offer beauty for each.\nA keynote high on aspiration and achievement and much more than just a new hairdryer.\nImage credit - CES screengrab\nLatest Conversations\nGo to topics\ndiginomica and the diginomica logo are trademarks of\ndiginomica Limited.\n\u00a9 Diginomica Limited and its licensors 2013-\n2024\nDeveloped by\nBRAINSUM\n."
