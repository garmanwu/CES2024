Marc McGrath, regional CEO, Americas, Schaeffler Group USA, said as Schaeffler builds on its 75-plus years of history, it is looking to capitalize on its core business\u2013 the manufacture of bearings\u2013while expanding its technological innovation in the areas of e-mobility. McGarth said this will allow the company to be defined as a motion technology company, which is its vision for the future.\nMcGrath used select words to describe Schaeffler\u2019s direction: sustain, energize, drive, generate, transmit and guide.\n\u201cOur foundational business is bearings and components\u2026when we classify those, we say those are the ones that guide motion. We also have products in the transmission and engine category that transmit torque, or motion. Now,\nwe\u2019re heavily involved in our actuation system, with the launch of the rear-steer system and many products on the chassis and industrial side. Those generate motion.\n\u201cWe\u2019re also transforming into the e-mobility world, so we have traction motors, e-drives, multiple platforms including hybrid systems, which drive motion,\u201d McGrath continued.\nTo energize motion, McGrath said Schaeffler will be launching batteries in the future as well as multiple projects in the hydrogen space. Ultimately, this leads to a sustainable future, he added. This means the company is looking at lifetime solutions that will be expected in the future to sustain motion, or mobility.\nMcGrath said in the Americas, Schaeffler is already working on projects that will help meet these goals. For example, the company is investigating a new manufacturing location in Ohio that will produce e-drives and e-axles to create product close to the customer for \u201cjust in time\u201d deliveries.\nSchaeffler\u2019s recently announced that it will combine business with Vitesco Technologies, which will \u201cbring power\u201d to its power electronics business, McGrath said. Under the agreement, Schaeffler and Vitesco will be able to complete and broaden their business and technology portfolios along four, focused \u201cpure-play\u201d divisions to offer a range of products in electrification\nOn the R&D side, McGrath noted Schaeffler\u2019s expansion in the Mexican market and other key, strategic areas. He explained that by 2030, 45% of Schaeffler\u2019s products will be new\u2013 those that did not exist in 2020.\nHe added that Schaeffler\u2019s focus on sustainability will continue, as the company continues to pursue its goal of being climate neutral by 2040.\nLastly, as Schaeffler looks to position itself as a motion technology company, McGrath said it will expand its co-op, and leadership programs. In its apprenticeship program, McGrath said Schaeffler will look to expand in tool manufacturing, electric controls and software.\nREMANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY\nMPA comprehensive clean-tech remanufacturing process produces superior performance and reliability, but it also makes a significant positive impact in terms of sustainability.\nManufacturers\u2019 Perspectives: The Aftermarket in 2024\nFind out what aftermarket parts manufacturers have in store for their businesses and what they\u2019re expecting for 2024 and beyond.\nA new year brings new growth opportunities, and according to several parts manufacturers, 2024 is showing positive signs. Vehicle miles driven is up, which means cars need more maintenance\u2014that means replacement parts. The average price of new cars has increased, meaning drivers will be holding onto their vehicles longer. With the average vehicle age at 12 years, opportunities for replacement part sales and tweaking the coverage, ordering and distribution of them abound for manufacturers and all stakeholders in the automotive aftermarket.\nMore than 770 new parts for passenger cars in North America were introduced by ZF last year.\nThe remanufactured Advantage clutches offer OE specifications at a more affordable price.\nThe move is part of HosePower\u2019s strategy to expand its hydraulic and industrial hose solutions and service operations.\nThe acquisition was finalized in December 2023 and allows TMD Friction to remain an independent entity with its own brand.\nBrian Blouin, group leader \u2013 supply chain management at Schaeffler Group USA, Inc., is the newest member of the Supply Chain & Operations Forum.\nThe 100% new part numbers cover more than 54 million VIO.\nThe campaign focuses on educating all stakeholders on recycling practices for vehicle batteries.\nAs part of the new strategy, Castrol will explore opportunities in battery thermal management, digital and service solutions and data center immersion cooling.\nSubscribe to our Newsletter\nOur Brands\nThe Business of Selling Parts\n\u00a9 Copyright\nBabcox Media Inc.

        "raw_content": "Dominion Energy admits it can't meet data center power demands in Virginia\nThe high-voltage lines simply can't handle more power, says the utility\nNorth American utility Dominion Energy says it may not be able to meet demands for power in Ashburn, Northern Virginia, delaying building projects in the world's fastest-growing data center hub by many years.\nDominion has told customers that it has power supplies, but can no longer guarantee to deliver the quantity of electricity customers want via overhead powerlines. If these warnings prove true, this could stall projects with billions invested, and Loudoun County's tax revenue would take a severe hit if the hub of data centers in Ashburn stalls. For now, local authorities and industry bodies are struggling to understand the sudden warning from Dominion.\nDominion supplies electricity in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, as well as natural gas to parts of the US. In the data center-rich counties of Loudoun, Prince William, and Fauquier, most of the electricity is carried by overhead powerlines marching along roads - a delivery method that has led to protests.\nLoudoun County has 26 million square feet of data center space, with 5 million more in development and many more projects planned. Data center equipment taxes provide one-third of the County's tax income, but has recently faced a backlash from residents who want fewer facilities built.\nNow they may get their wish - and may suffer from a lack of funds to the County coffers in the process.\nWells Fargo warning\nDominion could halt power delivery for new data center developments until 2025 or 2026, according to a warning that emerged in a note from Wells Fargo analysts to clients this week. Facilities which are only three to six months from completion should get their power, said the note, but any further from completion might face \"significant delays.\"\n\"The issue stems not from a lack of power generation capabilities, but rather, an inability to distribute over high-voltage power lines to Ashburn,\" said the Wells Fargo note, which DCD has seen. Even if developers have a commitment letter from the utility, they might still not get their power, says Wells Fargo.\nThe analysts' note was quickly confirmed by industry sources, including company earnings calls. Digital Realty's aptly-named CFO Andy Power told analysts yesterday that Dominion had warned Digital of a \"potential pinch point in Eastern Loudoun County that could delay deliveries until 2026,\u201d adding that the cause was \"transmission, not generation, i.e. the pipes or the power line infrastructure, not the actual power.\"\nWells Fargo predicts that data center construction planned for 2023/2024 could be \"significantly delayed,\" which would derail 90MW of hyperscale data center commitments, along with more leases planned for years to come.\nDigital's Power said there would be \"a slowdown in delivery of new supply in the largest and most consistently in-demand data center market in the world.\u201d\nPrince William will benefit\nThe Wells Fargo note predicts that data center projects affected by the overload in Loudoun will move to neighboring counties: \"We would envision that Prince William County could be a major beneficiary of new deployments moving away from Ashburn. Multiple companies, including CloudHQ, Stack Infrastructure, and Iron Mountain, have meaningful exposure to Prince William County. This development could also be a boon for Quantum Loophole, a developer that is building a 1GW hyperscale campus in nearby Maryland.\"\nDevelopers, operators, and local authorities are expressing frustration with Dominion's communication of the issue.\n\u201cThe power company did not give definitive answers to most of the relevant questions we have,\" said Power, \"but they have been transparent about the potential issue, and they\u2019re working very diligently to finalize their assessment.\"\nIndustry group the Data Center Coalition expressed concern. Its president Josh Levi said: \u201cWhile we are gathering additional information to help our members assess the impact on their businesses, the DCC is engaging proactively with Dominion and partners in state and local government to support the determination of the best path forward.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re only two weeks into the discussions, and are still trying to get a handle on the extent of the challenges we\u2019re facing,\u201d said Buddy Rizer, Executive Director, Loudoun County Department of Economic Development, reported in Data Center Frontier. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with everyone we can to try to figure out what steps we need to take to help deliver for the companies doing business in Loudoun County.\u201d\nPositive side?\nDespite the problem, Digital's Power said Ashburn would not lose importance: \u201cFirst and foremost, I don\u2019t see people leaving Ashburn for this delay. This isn\u2019t like a permanent feature, this is a bottleneck in a portion of Ashburn. And you\u2019ve got an incredible amount of customers, infrastructures, and network. Ashburn grew to where it is for many reasons, and I don\u2019t see demand just running away in the face of this.\u201d\nFor those with existing space in Ashburn, there's a positive side: They can charge more for it.\n\u201cI think the available capacity is going to become more precious,\u201d said Digital Realty's Power. \u201cThe 40 megawatts of operational space that we have today is more precious. And if we\u2019re able to proceed and bring on new capacity that I outlined, that becomes more precious.\"\nPower said this could actually be favorable to Digital overall. As well as the company's 40MW of space in Ashburn, the company has 50MW in a building that should be completed before Dominion cuts off new capacity, 200MW in Manassas in Prince William County, and 200MW on a site near Dulles Airport that has its own substation, and so is free from the overhead powerline issue.\nHowever, the Wells Fargo note gave a darker analysis: \"Digital Realty Trust has meaningful exposure to Ashburn, where it's in the initial stages of building capacity on its 'Western Lands' campus (a 400-acre property that ultimately can provision 1.5 GW of capacity). It appears this power crisis could hinder their ability to deliver capacity on that campus in the near future.\"\nDCD has asked Dominion for comment.\nGet a weekly roundup of North America news, direct to your inbox.\nMore in North America\nIssue 49 - The Rise and Rebirth of Carrier Hotels\nVantage files plans for San Antonio data center\nDiscussion\nMajor Panel: Data Center Operations in the Age of AI\nTags\nWhitepapers\nMore\nImproving data center reliability and efficiency by solving power quality pain points\nSignificant Advancements in Rack PDU Power Quality\nData Center Sustainability Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWorkload Placement Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWatch Now: Building a digital society - What market trends will be driving the industry forward?\nBrowse by Topic\nBrowse by Region\nProducts\nData Centre Dynamics Ltd (DCD), 296-300 St John St, London EC1V 4PAEmail.

Photo courtesy of Schaeffler.\nAt this year\u2019s 12th Schaeffler Kolloquium, the automotive and industrial supplier is giving around 300 customers from Europe and beyond a close-up look at the latest technologies for the future of sustainable, efficient, and comfortable mobility. The two-day event, themed \u201cEnergizing the Next Generation,\u201d puts the spotlight on innovations from Schaeffler\u2019s electromobility, chassis systems, and hydrogen technology operations. Held every four years, the Schaeffler Kolloquium is a worldwide customer showcase. It kicks off in B\u00fchl, Germany, where the Automotive Technologies division is headquartered, and will be followed in the course of the year by sister events in Detroit and San Jose (United States), Changsha (China), and Yokohama (Japan).\nSchaeffler develops and manufactures CO2-efficient powertrains\nSchaeffler offers its customers a wide range of powertrain solutions. Electrified powertrains have been part of its core business since 2018, and its R&D operations in this area employ 2,000 people worldwide. \u201cOur goal is to make mobility more efficient and climate-friendly,\u201d said Matthias Zink, CEO Automotive Technologies at Schaeffler AG. \u201cOur developments over the last few years constitute the greatest technological advance in future mobility to date.\u201d Looking ahead, a large portion of Schaeffler\u2019s business in electrified powertrain technology will relate to electric axle drives. One such drive is the new 4-in-1 e-axle, which brings together four subsystems \u2013 electric motor, transmission, power electronics, and thermal management \u2013 in one highly innovative, integrated system. Combined with an intelligent control system, this high degree of integration enables more efficient use of the thermal energy available in the vehicle, thereby increasing both range and ride comfort. At the heart of all electrified powertrains lie electric motors. Accordingly, Schaeffler is presenting a wide range of new developments in electric motor technology at this year\u2019s Kolloquium. These include process innovations, such as an improved wave winding technology, that enable higher energy-conversion efficiencies in current radial flux electric motors. Schaeffler has also developed a new type of axial flux motor that allows it to realize electric powertrains with very high volumetric power densities and hence achieve even greater powertrain efficiencies. Schaeffler laid the strategic groundwork for its innovative electric motors back in 2018 with the acquisition of Elmotec Statomat Holding GmbH. Based in Karben, Germany, Elmotec is one of the world\u2019s leading manufacturers of production machinery for the high-volume construction of electric motors and possesses unique expertise in winding technology. Today, Schaeffler manufactures components and systems for electrified mobility at multiple locations worldwide, including Szombathely (Hungary), Taicang (China), and Wooster (USA). And in B\u00fchl, the company is currently building a new global flagship plant for electric motors. People are also key: In the 30 months from September 2019 to March 2022, the company\u2019s Automotive Technologies division provided upskilling in e-mobility to some 630 of its employees.\nInnovative chassis technologies as enablers of automated driving\nAlongside these CO2-efficient propulsion systems, Schaeffler is shaping the future of mobility through new chassis applications that enable highly automated driving. These include steer-by-wire, a key technology that completely eliminates the mechanical connection between steering wheel and steering gear. Steer-by-wire will in future also open up completely new design possibilities for vehicle interiors. Also, on show at the Kolloquium in B\u00fchl is the Schaeffler Rolling Chassis, a scalable platform for new, driverless mobility solutions. Schaeffler is developing these solutions via the joint venture company Schaeffler Paravan Technologies. The rolling chassis is a universal platform that enables entirely new forms of autonomous mobility for everything from passenger and freight transport to service applications, such as cleaning machines. Configurable with various combinations of powertrain and steering systems, the chassis can also be tailored to a wide range of customer requirements in terms of maneuverability and performance.\nInnoplate joint venture to start production of bipolar plates in 2024\nSchaeffler\u2019s commitment to pioneering mobility also encompasses hydrogen technology, an area where the company will in future be offering bipolar plates for fuel cell stacks. To this end, the Schaeffler is establishing a joint venture company, called Innoplate, in partnership with Symbio, itself a hydrogen joint venture between Faurecia and Michelin. Innoplate will commence large-series production of bipolar plates at the start of 2024, thereby delivering improved performance, increased capacity, and economies of scale to customers. Schaeffler has been developing these bipolar plates, as well as the highly innovative processes needed for manufacturing them, since as long ago as 2017. At the Schaeffler Kolloquium, the plates are now being showcased for the first time in a demonstration vehicle. The vehicle \u2013 an electric van rebuilt from the ground up by Schaeffler \u2013 is driven by a Schaeffler 3-in-1 e-axle and powered by a Schaeffler fuel cell system.\nschaeffler.us/\nRelated Articles\nSchaeffler Showcases Innovations for Electric Motor Repair Industry at EASA 2022\nSchaeffler Symposium Highlights E-Mobility Transformation\nThe Future of E-Mobility\nSolid Edge 2024 Focuses on Performance and User Experience\nDigital Transformation Drives the Future of Packaging\nPaper Mill Precision\nFVA-Workbench Drives Progress in Marine Transmissions at Reintjes\nDesign Tips for Linear Motion Systems in Washdown Applications\nFVA-Workbench Drives Progress in Marine Transmissions at Reintjes\nDesign Tips for Linear Motion Systems in Washdown Applications\nSolid Edge 2024 Focuses on Performance and User Experience"

Schaeffler is even targeting solid state batteries \u2013 while admitting that technology remains years away.\nThough its acquisition of Vitesco Technologies and its power-electronics expertise still is evolving, McGrath said the company is planning a new factory in Ohio, which will primarily produce e-drives and e-axles. \u201cWe need to be in the Midwest to be close to our customers. These are larger units and we need to be just-in-time to our customers,\u201d he said.\nHe said that the company\u2019s goal is that by 2030, 45% of what it produces will be new products that did not exist in 2020. \u201cAnd climate neutrality by 2040 is another big target,\u201d McGrath added.\nChief Technology Officer Jeff Hemphill expanded on how the company\u2019s expertise helps its new efforts. For instance, he said the company\u2019s sheet-metal stamping expertise has multiple uses in the EV world. \u201cThe housing for our beam electric axle,\u201d he said,\u201d is actually two stampings that are welded together. Not only does that save 50 kilograms [110 lb.] of mass over the conventional axle design and offer better performance, but it also allows us to continue to use our existing presses.\u201d That means when the facility no longer makes torque converters, it can still use those capital assets to produce new revenue.\nHemphill also mentioned the capability to stamp its own lamination stacks for electric motors, something it discussed in an October briefing on its flexible e-motor manufacturing capabilities. He said Schaeffler\u2019s ability to design and produce e-motors in-house is a real competitive advantage. \u201cSo when [competitors] are trying to innovate an electric motor, it\u2019s a little more difficult for them to work through NDAs and other things to get the stamping supplier at the table with the engineers,\u201d he said. \u201cAll we have to do is call a meeting.\u201d\nHemphill said that the company\u2019s flexible approach \u2014 versus offering a static product lineup \u2014 means it\u2019s also willing and capable of making any subassembly of something like an e-axle.\nHemphill said the company is even innovating the bearings for electric axles, tying the topic back to its very first product, roller needle bearings. \u201cWe're innovating bearings right now that can conduct electricity around the rolling elements. So they avoid electrical damage or they can prevent electricity from passing through the bearing \u2013 all new topics for electric axles.\u201d Both McGrath and Hemphill talked about the company\u2019s new emphasis on actuators for EVs. Hemphill said one of the most-significant examples is its rear-steering technology, which is being called for in more EVs. \u201cWhen you go to electric vehicles\u2026 you put a large, flat battery pack in the bottom of the vehicle and that drives you to increase the wheelbase. And that means that you increase the turning radius, which you don't want,\u201d he said. \u201cThat makes rear-steer a real performance enhancement for electric vehicles. We see a big future for things like that.\u201d\nUp to 27% of Schaeffler\u2019s business is industrial, compared to the 60% that is automotive and 13% the auto aftermarket. On the industrial side, Hemphill said the company will be showing a new line of actuators, including an electromechanical actuator for a robot joint for which the company produces the motor, the control board and what he said is the \u201cratio-creating mechanism.\u201d He said that by using a power-dense strain-wave gearbox that uses a flex spline, it creates a \u201cvery high ratio in a small space.\u201d In answering a question about the future of the mechanical manufacturing business, CEO McGrath said the hoopla over the software-defined vehicle ignores a simple truth. \u201cClearly, software plays a huge role and AI becomes a big part of the future,\u201d he said. \u201cBut at the end of the day, bearings, rolling elements are not going to go away.\u201d"
