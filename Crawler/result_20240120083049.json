But if you're looking to snag some fabulous and futuristic products from CES 2024, don't fret. We've gathered plenty of cool gadgets you can get right now.\nAll of the products below are available to preorder or purchase directly. From clicky iPhone keyboards to smart indoor meat smokers, here are the best products of CES 2024 available right now. While you're here, check our our best of show picks for CES 2024 and take a look at the weirdest gadgets we found at the show.\nSoundFun Mirai Speaker: $299\nSick of straining to make out dialogue during movies only to be suddenly blasted by loud noises? Well, that's a problem the Mirai Speaker from SoundFun aims to resolve. It's a soundbar that dynamically sharpens the quality of speech while also reducing background noise, so you won't have to keep raising and lowering the volume for a comfortable listening experience. It's available to order now for $299.\nApollo Wearable: $280\nThe Apollo wearable is less about physical fitness and more about your mental health. It's designed to deliver \"soothing vibrations\" to your body in order to trigger a physiological response that improves your mood, reduces stress and helps you sleep. While it might sound like an expensive snake-oil doodad, especially at its full $350 price, it has been tested in clinical trials with results indicating improvements in things like heart-rate variability, quality of sleep, enhanced focus, reduced stress and more. You can order it right now with as much as $70 off.\nPunkt MC02 5G secure phone with Apostrophy OS: $749\nIf keeping your data private is important to you, you may want to consider investing in the privacy-focused Punkt MC02 5G smartphone. This secure phone has a 6.7-inch ISP display and comes with 128GB of storage that you can expand with a microSD card. With its own suite of secure tools, including email, calendar and more, as well as the Apostrophy OS (which is based on GrapheneOS), you can use apps with an added layer of protection to keep your data and personal information from being collected and passed along to advertisers and other big tech companies. It even comes with a built-in VPN.\nChipolo Perfectly Imperfect Card Spot item tracker: $35\nWhile Chipolo's Card Spot item tracker has been around for a while, the company used CES 2024 to debut its 'Perfectly Imperfect' edition. This version of the credit card-sized Find My device has some cosmetic blemishes that would usually result in the device being scrapped, but this way the less-than-perfect items can still be sold. They aren't any cheaper than the regular model, but a dollar per purchase goes to charity and you'll be doing a little bit to help reduce waste.\nTrek Fetch Plus 2 e-bike: $6,000\nThe new Fetch plus 2 cargo e-bike from Trek certainly isn't cheap, but if you need to tote around a bunch of gear or a kid or two regularly, it's an excellent and customizable option. Note that the base $6,000 price just gets you the longtail bike with accessories like seats and cargo bins being additional purchases.\nAudio-Technica ATH-TWX7 earbuds: $199\nAudio-Technica makes some of the best sounding wireless earbuds on the market with the ATH-TWX9. The newly unveiled ATH-TWX7 use the same 5.8mm high-resolution drivers from those flagship buds. They come in a little cheaper at $199, though, while still maintaining a high-fidelity experience. The TWX7 also don't have a UV anti-bacterial charging case like the TWX9s do.\nAnker Solix F3800 portable power station: $3,499\nWith a $500 launch discount, Anker's newest portable power station is worth considering for those needing to guard against power cuts or power small appliances while off-grid. It's got a 3.84 kWh capacity and a 6,000-watt max output, so it's pretty heavy-duty, and you can pair it with solar panels or further Anker batteries to expand your system over time.\nSegway Ninebot eKickScooter E2 Pro: $450\nSegway's Ninebot brand makes some of the best electric scooters, and it's latest entry is a solid value at under $500. The E2 Pro has a 15.5 miles per hour top speed and 16.8-mile range, plus some neat features including anti-skid traction control, turn signals built into the handlebars and support for Apple's Find My app. It's available to preorder now with a $50 launch discount and it'll\u00a0begin shipping later this month.\nEvie Ring: $269\nOne of our best of show products for CES 2024, the Evie Ring is a health tracker specifically designed with women's health in mind. The unobtrusive ring can fit on any finger, and it tracks sleep, heart rate, blood oxygen levels and steps. Its tiny battery will run for several days before it needs a recharge. The Evie Ring is taking preorders now and should start shipping at the end of this month.\nSegway Go Kart Pro 2: $1,799\nSegway's Go Kart Pro 2 solves the problem of what to do with a go-kart in winter -- use it as a gaming controller, of course! The sleek machine tops out at 26.7 miles per hour, and a new steering wheel includes a D-pad and buttons that let you use the device as a controller for video games.\nBest Buy is currently selling pre-orders of the the Go Kart Pro 2 for $1,799 ($500 off the expected retail price of $2,299), and the device is expected to start shipping in early March.\nJBuds Lux ANC headphones: $80\nJLab launched new over-the-ear noise-canceling headphones at CES 2024, with support for both Bluetooth multipoint and Google Fast Pair. JLab is currently taking pre-orders for the headphones in four colors -- white, graphite, sage and mauve -- and expects to start shipping in February.\nJackery Explorer 100 Plus: $109\nThis 128W portable power station weighs only a little over two pounds and sports one USB-A and two USB-C ports. It can be charged with portable solar panels and has enough power to charge an iPhone more than seven times. Plus, at 99 watt-hours, it technically squeezes in under the 100-Wh restriction from the TSA, which means you can use it to power your devices during long flights. It lists for $149, but right now you can save $40 when you use promo code NY40.\nNanoleaf Skylight: From $250\nWant smart lighting for your ceiling? The Nanoleaf Skylight can help you achieve a customizable look for any space. This set of modular square light panels are flush-mount and designed to be used on your ceiling. You'll have to install the control panel, but after hard-wiring one panel as you would any light fixture, you can then add up to 99 additional smart panels. You can preorder now, and Nanoleaf is offering a 10% discount when you use code FAST10.\nSatechi SM1 slim mechanical backlit Bluetooth keyboard: $100\nSatechi's SM1 keyboard is compact and wireless and features high-quality mechanical switches, as well as 14 different backlight patterns and over 16 hours of battery life. Plus, this rechargeable accessory can be used with both Windows and Mac and can even connect to up to four devices at a time.\nOhdoki Oh: $150\nOhdoki, the Norwegian company behind the Handy sex toy, announced a new sex tech device this year at\u00a0CES. It's called the Oh and it's a wireless and Bluetooth-enabled vibrator that uses sonic technology for user-customized vibrations. It's set to cost $150 and ship this spring, though you can preorder it for $75 right now.\nMotion Pillow: $420\nIf chronic snoring interferes with you getting proper rest, the Motion Pillow may be able to help. It has AI features that detect snorting, then inflate the pillow to elevate your head and open your airway. Plus, this system will track your sleep, snoring and other data so you can stay informed. Though it lists for $699, it's marked down by 40% during CES, bringing the price to\u00a0$420.\nCatalyst dog collar for AirTag: $25\nAirTag trackers are handy for keeping up with your essentials, and now Catalyst has a dog collar for AirTag that can keep up with your four-legged friend, even if your Hairy Houdini gives you the slip. It's designed to hold the $35 Catalyst Clip-It waterproof case, which is meant to keep your AirTag safe, and to give you a little peace of mind about the whereabouts of your furry pal. You can preorder the $25 collar now, but if you bundle it with the Clip-It, you can save $5.\nMSI gaming laptops: From $1,899\nMSI announced a slew of laptops at CES, including updates to its Titan, Raider and Vector series, plus the new Stealth series and more. Several of its new machines are available to preorder now with prices from $1,899.\niGulu F1 home brewing machine: $599\nThis countertop beer maker we tried out at CES is now available to preorder with late January shipping expected. If you want to make your own beer at home with minimal fuss, it could well be for you since you need only add water at the top and scan a barcode to let the machine know which type you're making. The iGulu F1 will ping your phone when you need to add each ingredient, making things super simple.\nAsus ROG Strix Scar laptops: From $2,900\nThe new Strix Scar 16 and 18 models are available to preorder right now having just been announced. Each features a mini-LED, 2.5K display, 240Hz refresh rate, 1,100 nits of peak brightness with HDR and over 2,000 dimming zones. The entry model starts at $2,900 and with a Core i9-14900HX CPU, RTX 4080 graphics, 32GB of 5,600MHz DDR5 RAM and a 1TB SSD. The base 16-inch model starts at $3,000 with the same internal specs, although each can be bumped up to an RTX 4090 and a 2TB SSD.\nEcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra power station: $5,799\nThis whole-home battery from portable power pros EcoFlow, the Delta Pro Ultra power station provides up to 21.6 kW of output and can disconnect from your smart panel to take it on the go -- whether that's hooking up your RV or to that little off-grid cabin in the woods. It's lithium iron phosphate batteries on wheels and it's among the most innovative energy tech we've seen at CES 2024. Our CNET team at CES described it as \"a Tesla Powerwall on wheels.\" You can order it now, with orders starting to ship on Jan. 9.\nRabbit R1 AI device: $199\nUpdate: The first batch of R1 devices has already sold out, but the second run is still available for preorder.\nIf you've ever dreamed of having a personal assistant to perform tasks for you, you'll be excited by the Rabbit R1 A1 device. According to CNET's Lisa Eadicicco, it essentially \"swaps out apps for an operating system that can learn how to use apps on your behalf.\" You can effectively use it through voice command and it operates the apps on your phone for you. It's currently available for preorder to ship in mid-March. The price is $199.\nY-Brush electric toothbrush: $100\nThis unique Y-shaped toothbrush claims to brush all your teeth in just 20 seconds. You put the entire thing in your mouth, bite down, press the button and dedicate 10 seconds per jaw (top and bottom teeth). While it first appeared at CES back in 2017, each year the product returns with variations. In the past, it's received mixed reviews from our CNET team, but as the years progressed it's gotten more and more favorable. Right now you can get the 2023 model on Amazon.\nClicks for iPhone: From $139\nAdd a BlackBerry-style clicky keyboard to your iPhone with this new keyboard case from Clicks.

It costs $1,750 for an 8TB model and $2,750 for a 16TB model, both of which are available now, with a 32TB version in the works too.\nUnistellar Odyssey and Odyssey Pro: From $2,500\nAmateur stargazers can already order Unistellar's new Odyssey and Odyssey Pro telescopes announced this week at CES. Although certainly not cheap, they are more attainable than the brand's near-$5,000 EVscope 2. With the addition of automatic autofocus and\u00a0pixel-binning\u00a0technology, the new scopes take a lot of the hassle out of astronomy and solar system photography. Just note that only the Odyssey Pro has an optical viewfinder, whereas the Odyssey requires you to use the accompanying app.\nEvolve Mvmt: $499\nThe Evolve Mvmt is an ankle band launched at\u00a0CES\u00a0that is all about measuring how you're walking rather than how much you're moving each day to reduce the impact on your joints. If you're not satisfied with the current crop of fitness trackers and step counters on the market, it could be for you, although it's certainly not cheap at $499.\nFor all of our CES 2024 coverage, from stained-glass window solar panels to 115-inch TV sets, be sure to hit up our full\u00a0CES 2024 roundup.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

        "raw_content": "10 gadgets from CES 2024 that you can buy already\nThere are a lot of \"maybes\" and \"hope tos\" uttered at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), as many of the products demoed there take months or years to launch. And that's if they even make it to market at all; prototypes, previews, and proofs of concept are running themes at the annual tech convention in Las Vegas. But fortunately for anyone eager to get their hands on the latest gadgets, there are a few exceptions every year.\nBelow, we've rounded up a list of products from CES 2024 that are actually available for purchase or preorder immediately, including innovative wearables, stick-on TVs, and a physical manifestation of AI. Some of them blew us away, while others just weirded us out.\n1. Clicks Creator Keyboard Founders Edition\nThe Y2K revival rages on. Featuring a physical backlit keyboard that supports standard shortcuts (like CMD + A for \"Select All\"), this unibody case evoking the Sidekicks and Blackberries of yore is Clicks Technology's debut product. It's available in \"BumbleBee\" (yellow) and \"London Sky\" (gray) for the iPhone 14 Pro, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max.\n2. Garmin Lily 2\nGarmin's latest smartwatch is easily its most fashion-forward wearable to date, with a metal case and patterned lenses that act like stylish screensavers when the display is powered off. It comes with sleep monitoring and built-in sport apps, including a new dance fitness activity that can track different dance styles, and it lasts up to five days on a single charge. The standard Lily 2 comes in two colors with silicone bands, while the slightly pricier Lily 2 Classic (which adds support for Garmin Pay contactless payments) comes in four colors with nylon or leather bands.\n3. Apollo\nRead Mashable's full review of the Apollo.\nApollo Neuro says its new wellness wearable can improve your focus, help you sleep better, and ease your stress with the power of \"good vibes\" \u2014 i.e., by stimulating your vagus nerve (which regulates important bodily functions like heart rate and breathing). It didn't live up to all of those claims when Mashable tech editor Kim Gedeon tried it for three weeks ahead of CES, though it did have a positive effect on her social anxiety: \"It's similar to how I feel when I'm listening to binaural beats or ASMR,\" she wrote. At the time of publication, it was on sale for almost $70 off via Amazon and the Apollo Neuro website.\n4. EVOLVE MVMT\nEvolve MVMT's \"first-of-its-kind\" ankle wearable aims to make your gait more efficient and joint-friendly by tracking the quality (not quantity) of your steps \u2014\u00a0more specifically, the way your heel strikes the ground. If you're a flat-footed person who's \"ever had to pay for expensive orthotics or special footwear, which then has to be replaced every few years, this might be a solid alternative,\" wrote tech reporter Cecily Mauran.\n5. Nimble\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Nimble.\nIn one of the less dystopian examples of \"robots are taking over the world,\" the Nimble is a new 12-inch manicure robot that uses scanning technology and AI to do your nails in about half an hour. \"Since there was high demand to test out Nimble, I was only able to get one nail painted,\" Mauran reported from CES. \"But within minutes, I got polish and a topcoat, and my nail was fully dry. ... Nimble is precise and on par with the pros.\" Its polish capsules will be available in 30 colors, and new features \u2014 including pedicures \u2014 are supposedly in the works.\n6. Displace Flex and Displace Mini\nWatch Mashable staff try the Displace Mini.\nThey're not quite as exciting as LG's new transparent TV, but Displace's new lightweight, wireless 4K displays are still pretty cool in their own right (and certainly more practical): They have battery-powered suction that allows them to stick onto almost any wall or window \u2014 no mounting required. \"It's impossible to pull off unless you actually want to take it off,\" said tech reporter Matt Binder, who took part in a demo at CES. Both the 55-inch Flex model and the 27-inch Mini variant are expected to ship out in late 2024.\n7. Acer Swift Go 14\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Acer Swift Go 14.\nThe new Acer Swift Go 14 looks like a very average laptop until you pull up YouTube, which triggers a set of light-up media controls on its touchpad \u2014 a neat feature for those who use a PC as their primary entertainment device. (Support for other platforms like Twitch and Spotify are expected to be added at launch in March.) The base configuration is powered by a 13th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, but you can upgrade to a newer Intel Core Ultra 5 CPU.\n8. HP Spectre x360 14\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the HP Spectre x360 14.\nHP's newly refreshed convertible boasts next-gen specs (including an Intel Core Ultra processor with AI tools), a 14-inch OLED touchscreen, and a 9MP webcam. But the real star of the show is its clickety-clackety keyboard, which Gedeon called \"the best thing I've ever tested.\" \"I actually contemplated chucking my MacBook Pro out the window for that sweet, sweet typing experience on this irresistible HP laptop,\" she wrote.\n9. Wacom Cintiq Pro tablets\nAvailable in three sizes (17-, 22-, or 27-inch), Wacom's stunning and spacious new drawing slates were the best tablets Mashable saw at CES. Each one sports a vivid 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate and customizable ExpressKeys for different settings and functions. They also come with the new Wacom Pro Pen 3, an ergonomic, pressure-sensitive stylus that \"allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning,\" Gedeon said post-demo.\n10. Wehead GPT Edition\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Wehead GPT Edition.\nThe Wehead puts a literal (emotionless, disembodied) face to OpenAI's large-language model GPT via two screens, and it's as creepy as it sounds. But in its defense, \"it gave some practical advice about surviving CES (stay hydrated, wear comfortable shoes) so there might be some redeemable qualities \u2014 if you're willing to spend $5,000,\" wrote Gedeon and Mauran. If you don't want to curse yourself to a lifetime with this thing, you've also got the option of renting it for $199 per month.\nHonorable mention: Skyted Mask\nAnother CES gadget that toed the fine line between \"wowing\" and \"weirding out,\" the Skyted Muzzle Mask has sound absorption technology that lets you make confidential voice calls when you're out in public. \"[We're] sure some people who are serious about their privacy may find it to be a must-buy for their lifestyle,\" said Gedeon and Mauran. \"However, we can\u2019t see ourselves using this product \u2013 it\u2019s just too outlandish for our tastes.\" Those who fall into the former category can save a serious chunk of cash by backing it on Kickstarter through early February.\nHonorable mention: Stern 'Jaws' pinball machine\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Stern JAWS pinball machine.\nStern's faithful pinball adaptation of the 1975 classic includes that awesome John Williams score, some new voiceover lines from Richard Dreyfuss, and a playfield filled with movie references that's \"immensely fun to look at,\" said tech and games reporter Alex Perry. Now, for the catch (of the day): It appears to be limited to commercial dealers and distributors, and it starts at a whopping $7,000; you can go all the way up to $13,000 for the limited-edition model with different cosmetics. Maybe just wait for it to show up at your local dive bar.\nTopics\nCES\nHaley Henschel is a Chicago-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable who reviews and finds deals on popular tech, from laptops to gaming consoles and VPNs.

The company will present 20 new mobility technologies that are ready for immediate mass production.\nAt CES, Mobis will focus its efforts on growing its international sales by targeting global clients. Various products in areas such as automotive components, electrification, lamp and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) will be showcased to potential clients, including its future mobility core technologies, such as the Innovative Display series \u2014 rich in high-value advanced technology \u2014 and the high-power Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU).\nThe Innovative Display series, which is a collection of high-value, cutting-edge technologies, will be the focus at the Mobis exhibition. The company will present its leading innovative display technologies for automobiles, such as the world's first in-vehicle rollable display and swivel display, as well as the Quantum Dot and Local Dimming Display (QL) display and 3D display that feature OLED-level performance in LCD.\nA transparent display for automobiles will be presented for the first time during the exhibition. This product is a next-generation display which employs holographic optical elements technology. The display can realize the projection of clear images on a transparent panel while providing drivers with a wider sense of space and openness than that of general displays.\nTransparent displays enable images to be magnified on the front windshield. Thus, drivers can check various display information without shifting their gaze too much, increasing the level of safety. Because of their unique features, it is expected that transparent displays will bring many changes to future automobile designs once they are mass produced. Estimates indicate significant demand from global car manufacturers, creating high expectations for the display's future technological development and mass production.\nInnovative technologies in the field of electrification, the driving force for future growth, also await to be selected by global automakers based on Mobis' abundant mass production know-how. At the center of electric driving is the 22 kW-class ICCU, which Mobis proudly presents along with its battery system (BSA).\nICCU is a key element for electric vehicle charging and driving and is a power conversion system integrating elements such as DC/AC charging devices and communication equipment. The higher the output, the better the charging speed and efficiency. If the 22 kW-class ICCU is installed in an electric vehicle with the same specifications, the vehicle's charging time is reduced by half when compared to that of an 11 kW-class ICCU.\nMoreover, the 22 kW-class ICCU is closely related to vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, a type of electric car battery used as a large power source, offering limitless versatility. Mobis is planning to lead related markets through its 22 kW-class ICCU, which surpasses the capability of the 11 kW-class and has received the greenlight for mass production.\nAdditionally, Mobis will introduce its future mobility vehicle, which utilizes next-generation mobility technologies, for the first time at CES. In the past, the exhibition has been mainly comprised of visual displays, showcasing technical products and concept cars. However, this year, exhibition visitors will be allowed to get in the actual automobile, offering attendees an interactive and enjoyable experience. The automobile is equipped with features, such as the e-Corner system, that have been capturing the public's attention. This system allows all four wheels to turn 90 degrees, enabling parallel movement.\n* Hyundai Mobis Booth: Las Vegas Convention Center, West Hall #5216\nAbout Hyundai Mobis\nHyundai Mobis is the global no. 6 automotive supplier, headquartered in Seoul, Korea.
