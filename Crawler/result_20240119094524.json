        "raw_content": "Big Chinese companies brighten 2024 CES\nChinese technology companies have made a prominent comeback at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nAt the world's premier tech show in Las Vegas in the United States, they are showcasing their latest achievements in cutting-edge technologies. These range from artificial intelligence, next-generation semiconductor display, autonomous driving, robots to augmented reality.\nHighlighting that China is playing an increasingly vital role in bolstering technological innovation, experts said intelligent devices powered by generative AI and the internet of things are expected to become a key growth driver for global consumer electronics industry.\nAccording to the US Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, more than 4,000 enterprises from across the globe are participating in the CES, which opened on Tuesday and will conclude on Friday. Of these, 1,114 are from China and 1,201 are based in the US.\nAI-powered terminal devices are attracting attention this year amid a worldwide frenzy over the ChatGPT chatbot. Chinese consumer electronics maker TCL demonstrated over 120 pieces of intelligent hardware covering quantum dot mini-LED TVs, AI processing chips, smartphones, intelligent AR goggles and vehicle-mounted display products.\nThe company is accelerating efforts to expand presence in North America by boosting production capacity at its Mexican factory, given that building global competitiveness has always been important for TCL.\nHisense Group, a major Chinese home appliance manufacturer, unveiled its latest ultra light-emitting diode or ULED TV and laser display technology at the CES.\nDavid Gold, vice-president of Hisense International, said at a product launch event that display technology is widely applied in sports, education and medical fields, continuously pushing technological boundaries.\nLenovo Group Ltd, the world's largest personal computer maker, unveiled a full lineup of more than 40 new devices and solutions powered by AI at the CES. It said it believes this year will mark the advent of AI-based PCs.\nXpeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's Xpeng Motors, showcased its pilotless flying car, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft at the CES.\n\"Chinese tech companies are at the forefront of technological innovation globally, and actively promoting the application of AI in consumer electronics, intelligent devices and electric vehicles,\" said Hong Yong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe latest technological breakthroughs made by Chinese companies in the fields of virtual reality and autonomous driving also reflect their strengths and innovative capabilities in crucial technologies, which will be conducive to industrial upgrades and boosting their own competitiveness on the global stage, Hong said.\nChinese augmented reality company Xreal showcased its latest AR-enabled innovative products by partnering with companies such as Qualcomm and BMW.\nCES attendees can join a Las Vegas tour hosted by BMW, where they will have the opportunity to experience Xreal's AR glasses along the way. They can witness how in-car information, including navigation cues, hazard warnings, entertainment content and charging station details seamlessly integrate into the real environment through Xreal Air 2 glasses.\nJin Peng, co-founder of Xreal, said, \"In the future world, whether it's in offices or entertainment, for mobile commuting or personal enjoyment, people will engage in work and experience life in new and creative ways.\"\nChinese tech companies have shown the potential to lead the industry not only in mature categories such as smartphones, but also in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence of things, AR and VR, said Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center at Zhejiang University's International Business School.\nContact the writers at fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn\nCopyright 1995 -\n.

        "raw_content": "Get local news delivered to your inbox!\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\nCongress passes short-term bill averting government shutdown until March\nNorthWestern gas plant proposal stalls over city's objections\nNeighbors opposed to a new NorthWestern Energy natural gas power plant near Laurel gather in November of 2021 to talk about the project. From left, Kasey and Aaron Felder, Steve Krum, Calvin Lance and Carol Blades look over the proposed location.\nOil and gas pipelines run through Laurel's Riverside Park and under the Yellowstone River.\nOnce a crude oil pipeline for Phillips 66, the Bryon Pipeline has been sold to NorthWestern Energy and is being converted to carry natural gas to a proposed gas-fired power plant in Laurel. The pipeline will connect the power plant to gas fields in Wyoming, Colorado, Oklahoma and Kansas.\nThe CHS Refinery in Laurel is seen in the distance beyond a plot of land purchased by NorthWestern Energy to become the future site of a new gas-fired power plant.\nNorthWestern Energy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s plans to build a gas-fired power plant have stalled in Laurel, where neighbors say the generator will ruin their quality of life.\nLast week, the Laurel City Council again delayed votes critical to the plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development and formed a fact-finding commission to square the utility\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s statements with neighborhood concerns about noise and pollution.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We represent the citizens. The citizens have continued to come into this chamber and speak against this plant,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Heidi Sparks, a City Council member explaining that after doing her own research, if she had to vote today, she would vote no.\nNorthWestern, which announced its intention to build the gas plant eight months ago, still needs several things from the City of Laurel, including a zoning change and an easement to bore a natural gas pipeline beneath Riverside Park, which offers the community its best public access to the Yellowstone River.\nPeople are also reading\u2026\nCity staff have warned the council not to put the cart before the horse by granting NorthWestern the needed changes without first annexing the property to assure the power plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s property taxes, estimated at $10 million a year, mostly flow to Laurel.\nNorthWestern, which did not respond to an interview request for this article, assures Laurel there will be time for annexation later.\nThen, there is the issue of power plant noise raised by neighbors.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Mayor (Emelie) Eaton can you help me out with this?\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Aaron Felder as he produced a decibel meter and a boom box to illustrate during a meeting just how loud 65 decibels of noise are.\nA woman in the front row used her fingers to plug her ears as Felder pumped up the jams, of what sounded like a large locomotive or factory engine.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153That\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s holding steady at 61,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Eaton said, as Felder\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s voice faded beneath the groan of trundling steel.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153So, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a constant noise, 24/7,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Felder said after turning off the sound. And when the sound hits the water, it goes even further.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nFelder and his wife, Kasey, live on the opposite side the Yellowstone River from the power plant site. They can see the tallest pieces of the power plant substation rising above the riverbank treetops. The potential of 18 stacks, 77 feet tall, in the same location concerns them and their neighbors.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153These people live very close to those 18 stacks, concentrated in one area, one breeze in the wrong direction can lay that pollution right on top of them. They\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re that close,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Steve Krum told the council.\nWhen neighbors on the south side of the river heard the utility describe the power plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s noise as minimal, not unlike a vacuum cleaner, they thought they better check it out.\nSteve Krum looked up the decibels reported by Montana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department of Environmental Quality, which permitted the gas plant earlier this year. DEQ reported the noise to be 65 decibels. The city planning committee had been told the noise from the plant would travel west toward the CHS refinery, but the DEQ application indicated the noise would travel in every direction for 200 yards, too close for the neighbors on the opposite side of the Yellowstone.\nThe folks living on the south side of the river tend to be blue collar. Aaron Felder is a crane operator who works at the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s oil refineries. Krum is a retired refinery worker.\nSilence and distance define the neighborhoods on the Yellowstone\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s south banks. Every home is a five-minute walk down a gravel road from the next. The gardens are large, and the wildlife is ample. This time of year, you see bald eagles nesting in the trees along the river. At night you can hear owls.\nNorthWestern has conveyed the importance of the gas plant, telling the City Council if it doesn't approve the easement and zoning, Montanans\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 utility bills will skyrocket.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153If we don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t do this, we end up on the open market buying power at $500 to $600 per megawatt hour, rather than generating it ourselves at $30 to $40 a megawatt hour. And I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t think our customers would appreciate that. It would violate our mission to provide safe reliable, 24-7 power,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Roy Ishkanian, manager of lands and permitting for NorthWestern Energy.\nThe north side of the Yellowstone River where the utility intends to build its power plant is home to the Laurel sewer plant, NorthWestern\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s substation and is several hundred yards east of the CHS refinery. The location is right for a gas plant, Ishkanian said. NorthWestern intends to use the power plant to offset periods when production from renewable energy sources is down.\nThe new power plant is a reciprocating internal combustion engine, or RICE plant. Easily ramped up or down, RICE plants have become a popular tool for balancing intermittent generating resources like wind and solar farms. For perspective, the RICE plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 175-megawatt capacity would be about 78% of the nameplate capacity of NorthWestern\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s 30% share of Colstrip Power Plant Unit 4.\nThe \u00e2\u20ac\u0153or else\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd scenario posed by Ishkanian was quickly rebutted by Jennifer Harbine, an attorney for Earth Justice who clarified that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the Montana Public Service Commission, not the Laurel City Council that determines what NorthWestern\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s customers will pay for electricity.\nThe challenges faced by the gas plant aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t limited to the City Council. Montana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department of Environmental Quality is being sued for its permitting of the power plant. The Montana Environmental Information Center and Sierra Club say DEQ ignored the power plant\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s contribution to local air and water pollution.\nThe area where the power plant would be located has already been dinged by the EPA for excessive sulfur dioxide levels, mainly emanating from a CHS oil refinery near the gas-fired power plant site. Carbon dioxide from the gas-fired plant, some 769,706 tons a year, is a climate change contributor. Harbine is representing the plaintiffs, who argue the DEQ ignored the Montana Environmental Policy Act, which requires a comprehensive treatment of environmental risks.\nTime has also become a challenge for building the plant, according to NorthWestern. The utility had initially attempted to get preapproval to bill customers $283.8 million for the power plant. That months-long process before the Montana Public Service Commission was halted abruptly in September because, NorthWestern explained, it needed to \u00e2\u20ac\u0153accelerate the commercial operation date of Laurel Generating Station,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd as the power plant is known. Seeking preapproval could have taken until early March 2022.\nAt the time NorthWestern was abandoning preapproval in Montana, it was also discontinuing plans for a $60 million gas-fired power plant in Aberdeen, South Dakota, again because of significant increases in construction costs related to supply chain problems.\nSunday will mark two months since NorthWestern announced it was expediting construction. The building site shows few signs of activity.\nThe Laurel fact-finding commission was already coming together Nov. 16 as a signup sheet went through the audience at the City Council meeting.\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\nSubscribe to our Daily Headlines newsletter.\nAgriculture and Politics Reporter\n{{description}}\nEmail notifications are only sent once a day, and only if there are new matching items.\nRelated to this story\nDEQ sued over Laurel gas plant permit\nMontana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department of Environmental quality is being sued for allegedly ignoring the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Constitution when permitting a gas-fired power \u2026\nCall for major investment in renewable energy worries Montana utilities\nThe latest roadmap for the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s energy future is big on renewables and confident that coal-fired power plant retirements won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t lead to bla\u2026\nNorthWestern changes Laurel power plant plans\nNorthWestern Energy is withdrawing its request for regulatory approval to build a new natural gas-fired power plant in Laurel, opting to move \u2026\nMontana's largest wind farm contracts with Puget Sound Energy\nWhat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s expected to be Montana\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest wind farm secured its first customer Wednesday from Colstrip Power Plant co-owner Puget Sound Energy.\nNorthWestern's plans for Laurel power plant take shape\nNorthWestern states that the gas plant would add nearly $80 a year to the average residential power bill.\nMore details about Laurel power plant emerge\nMore details are emerging about NorthWestern Energy\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s proposed gas-fired power plant near Laurel.\nCommittee kills Colstrip bill over consumer concerns\nA controversial bill to shield NorthWestern Energy from future financial losses associated with rescuing Colstrip Power Plant has been tabled.\nNorthWestern Energy building $250M natural gas power plant in Laurel\nNorthWestern Energy intends to build a $250 million, 175-megawatt power plant in Laurel as part of a plan to add 325 megawatts of dispatchable\u2026\nLaurel refinery not yet compliant with arsenic release standards in Yellowstone River\nSince 2015 when its old pollution discharge permit expired the CHS Inc. refinery in Laurel has been allowed to exceed state water quality stan\u2026\nNorth Dakota treasury benefiting from higher oil prices\nClimbing U.S. oil prices that have motorists paying more at the gas pumps are adding to North Dakota's bottom line.\nNorth Dakota eyes federal money for expansion of oil well plugging program\nNorth Dakota regulators want to extend the state\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s abandoned oil well plugging program by tapping into $4 billion available through the federa\u2026\nTough time for trees: Old logging lands need lots of work\nTrees talk in rings and needles, and the trees along Gold Creek are cranky.\nProspectors hitting the gas in north-central Montana hoping to strike helium\nHelium prospecting is picking up in north-central Montana with Canadian companies expanding south after years of development in Saskatchewan a\u2026\nMontana's largest wind farm underway near Miles City\nHalf of the project is scheduled to come online in late 2022.

It sits near the banks of the Yellowstone River, not far away from the CHS refinery. NorthWestern Energy is building the 175-megawatt plant that has 18 reciprocating internal combustion engines at a cost of $250 million.\nDistrict court judge Michael Moses halted the plant\u2019s progress, saying that the Montana Department of Environmental Quality failed to consider the impact that greenhouse gases would have on the environment, the equivalent of more than 160,000 cars\u2019 worth of pollution annually. His decision spurred legislation in the Montana Legislature that would order the DEQ not to consider greenhouse gases, and also make environmental litigation more costly and cumbersome for resident and nonprofit groups.\nNorthWestern said it will appeal Moses\u2019 decision to the Montana Supreme Court.\nSunday\u2019s meeting, sponsored by the Northern Plains Resource Council and held at the Laurel United Methodist Church, was to present community concerns about the plant, as well as to hear from residents who live nearby.\n\u201cTo be clear: We want to stop the methane power plant. That\u2019s our goal,\u201d said Mary Fitzpatrick, a member of Northern Plains and a former chairwoman of the board.\nThe meeting brought more than a 100 people to the event, and the organizers had sent a notice to every Laurel resident. Laurel is also home to one of the county\u2019s three oil refineries and home to a large BNSF railyard.\nKasey Felder, whose property sits 2,300 feet from the new power plant, criticized NorthWestern Energy for being unconcerned about the welfare of the surrounding property owners.\n\u201cNo one has talked with me about the health impacts and they haven\u2019t talked to our neighbors,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd you know if any one of us had built something that was not permitted, we\u2019d be stopped, but I guess it pays to have corporate lawyers.\u201d\nHer father, Laurel resident Steve Krum, said he retired as an oil refinery operator.\n\u201cNo one is spouting off against oil and fossil fuels,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s time to start planning for the future and thinking about our families and health.\u201d\nHe and other organizers said with Moses\u2019 decision, it\u2019s time to rally community support to stop the plant from hurting property values and the environment.\n\u201cOur elected officials have made decisions before the plant was built,\u201d Krum said. \u201cThe game feels stacked and the Legislature is not listening.\u201d\nKrum criticized NorthWestern Energy for proceeding to build the plant during the midst of litigation over the air quality permits as well as zoning concerns that are still pending before courts.\nKrum also said NorthWestern\u2019s permit, which said the operating noise at the border of the property is at 65 decibels, is not accurate. Sixty-five decibels is the sound of a loud conversation.\n\u201cWe\u2019re going to pay through the nose for a power plant that pollutes our community and destroys our property values,\u201d he said.\nOther residents criticized Northern Plains for what they saw as \u201cpropaganda.\u201d\n\u201cWind energy is not green and it\u2019s not viable,\u201d said resident Carlyn Fulton, who said that wind energy provides less than 8% of Montana\u2019s energy needs. \u201cI commend NorthWestern Energy for bringing it (the natural gas plant) into this community.\u201d\nBecause natural gas is cleaner than coal, she said it was a good option for on-demand power.\n\u201cYou can spew all the facts from the permit, but this decision was made by a very liberal district court judge, and he is not a scientist. You are not a scientist,\u201d Fulton said to Krum. \u201cYou\u2019re exaggerating. We need electricity, just look at the grids in Texas and California. Natural gas is predicted to stay cheap through at least 2027.\u201d\nGeorge Wheatcroft, who said he\u2019d recently moved back after a career as an electrical engineer, said that even during the outages in Texas, which has good wind energy, more peak power was needed.\n\u201cYou need peaking power, and as I read over this, 41% of the peak energy power from NorthWestern was from someplace else,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we have a strong cold snap and we don\u2019t have power, people will be desperate. We\u2019re going to need more power sources.\u201d\nDr. Robert Byron, a physician, and his wife, Lori, who is also a physician, spoke about the environmental health impacts of air pollution. In addition to being a board certified pediatrician, Dr. Lori Byron also has a master\u2019s in energy policy.\n\u201cIf we don\u2019t do something about climate change, what we do in the exam rooms won\u2019t do much to help,\u201d said Dr. Robert Byron. \u201cOur emissions are literally killing us \u2013 and not just the ones from our power plants.\u201d\nHe pointed to data from the American Lung Association that shows that as many as 250,000 Americans die yearly from air pollutants.\n\u201cI have a wood stove in my house, as do many of you, I\u2019m sure,\u201d Dr. Robert Byron said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know about particulate matter, but now we do. It may not affect everybody, but we know that there are health risks associated with burning wood, and other products.\u201d\nFor example, he noted that methane, which comprises the bulk of natural gas, is 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide as a greenhouse gas.\nResidents also were concerned that NorthWestern is incentivized to build the plant because of its guaranteed rate of return as a publicly regulated utility in Montana.
