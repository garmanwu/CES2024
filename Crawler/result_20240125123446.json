(CEO Oh Eun-song), an AI-based 3D solution developer, plans to participate in CES 2024, an international consumer electronics show held in Las Vegas, USA from January 9 to 12, 2024. During the event, Deep-In-Sight will introduce for the first time \u201cDIMENVUE\u201d, an AI-based portable 3D floor plan scanner.\nDIMENVUE is a lightweight, portable device that uses an ultra-precise LiDAR sensor and an ultra-light, high-capacity lithium-ion battery. The device helps label and segment objects in 2D RGB images through AI deep learning. And DIMENVUE also helps users obtain various spatial information in real-time by combining the objects in the image with 3D information. With this function, it is easy to select and monitor specific object information needed for floor plans in the construction industry, and it is also possible to output 3D images of the photographed space. While existing 3D scanners with LiDAR sensors are too heavy and large, DIMENVUE is light and easy to carry.\nDeep-In-Sight, participating in CES 2024 for the first time since rebranding and adopting a new corporate identity in November 2023, will also showcase three \u201ccustomized 3D camera solutions\u201d in line with the CES 2024 theme of \u201cArtificial Intelligence\u201d. In addition to DIMENVUE, the company plans to introduce a total of three new products: \u201cCAMOSYS\u201d, an in-cabin monitoring solution; \u201cROUNVUE\u201d, a 3D surround view monitoring solution; and \u201cVOMASYS\u201d, a volume measurement solution that can help the logistics and transportation industries change billing methods in a more efficient way. Deep-In-Sight is currently working with leading OEM companies in Korea to mass-produce these new solutions.\nDeep-In-Sight CEO Oh Eun-song said, \u201cDeep-In-Sight is a company that efficiently solves customers\u2019 problems in technology fields such as mobility and smart factories with its proprietary AI-based 3D camera solutions. She continued, \u201cWe look forward to participating in CES 2024 next month. Based on our unique technology and successful PoC experience in smart factories and logistics, we aim to establish partnerships with global customers at CES 2024, creating various new business opportunities.\u201d\nDeep-In-Sight, located in Pangyo Techno Valley, provides convenient services to industrial sites in mobility, smart factories, and robotics through AI-based 3D solutions. During the 2024 CES event, Deep-In-Sight plans to introduce DIMENVUE at the AI-Robotics Pavilion and also introduce 3D solutions that can be easily used in the logistics industry.\nFor inquiries and connections with Korean tech companies mentioned in this article, contact us at\u00a0[email\u00a0protected].

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nMy Top 10 Revolutionary Discoveries At CES 2024: AI, Robotics, Web3\nLisa Martin and Sandy Carter on CES Live\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is more than an event; it's a crystal ball into the technological marvels that will shape our world in the next half-decade. This year's CES, a melting pot of over 135,000 technology enthusiasts and innovators, showcased over 4,300 exhibits that spanned the spectrum of human ingenuity.\nHere's a snapshot of my top ten groundbreaking favorites:\nThe FQ Women Walk the Floor\nThe event at CES by Female Quotient was a powerful testament to women's growing influence in technology. It provided a platform where a diverse group of leaders \u2013 from visionary C-Suite executives to groundbreaking female founders and tech giants \u2013 converged to share their insights. They discussed strategies and initiatives aimed at narrowing the gender gap within the industry.\nWomen Walk the Floor at CES\n\u201cWe are all about creating a space and culture where we all feel welcome and like we belong. Here we all are walking the CES floor together, the most amazing thing we could possibly imagine because a woman alone has power but collectively, we have impact.\" - Shelley Zalis, Founder & CEO of The Female Quotient at the 2024 Women Walk the Floor Tour at CES. This is a significant milestone in our journey toward a more inclusive industry, making it a crucial highlight of my list.\nHydrogen Powered 18-Wheelers (or Class 8 Semi-Trucks)\nThe convention center was abuzz with the sight of Nikola 's Class 8 zero-emission truck, a progressive innovation that marks a new chapter in sustainable transport with hydrogen-powered fuel cells. The zero-emission semi-trucks, with a remarkable range of up to 500 miles, signify a leap towards a greener future. Pedro Garcia's insights on their developmental journey, which included extensive applications of the virtual world of Altair's simulations and data analytics tools, provided a fascinating narrative on how these behemoths transitioned from digital prototypes to the tarmac. \u201c\"At CES, as the industry discussed hydrogen's role in the future of transportation, the sight of the Nikola hydrogen fuel cell electric truck in action on the roads around the convention center affirmed 2024 promises to be a pivotal year for the transportation industry and especially Nikola,\" said Pedro Garcia, Nikola Global Head of Product Development. \"In showcasing the operational capabilities of our Class 8 zero-emission truck that is in production and being delivered to customers, we brought the future to life. Here's to an inspiring journey ahead, as we contribute to a more sustainable and innovative tomorrow.\" This innovation is a harbinger of the hydrogen economy, securing its spot on my list.\nPedro Garcia in front of the Nikola Hydrogen Powered 18 Wheeler at CES\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023\nDeep Orange 14 from Clemson University\nThis year, the Deep Orange 14 autonomous vehicle, a product of Clemson University's bright minds, was a beacon of hope for disaster-stricken areas. The collaboration with the U.S. Army culminated in a vehicle that can navigate treacherous terrains to deliver aid without endangering human lives. This marvel of engineering, with over 900 parameters under constant surveillance, is at the forefront of autonomous research and deserves its acclaim for pushing the boundaries of technology for the greater good.\nDeep Orange 14 from Clemson University\nFlux Web3 Decentralized Cloud\nAmidst the clamor for genuine decentralization, the Flux Cloud emerged as a paradigm shift for developers seeking to build on a truly decentralized web3 infrastructure. This platform is a cornerstone for future applications, promising an escape from the centralized grip of web2. According to Blockworks, more of the world\u2019s largest Web2 game companies will embrace web3 in 2024. And per web3 statistics, projections indicate that the web3 industry could reach a valuation of approximately $14.5 trillion by 2030 and up to $11 trillion by 2024. Its potential for enhancing scalability, flexibility, and censorship resistance is why it's a key feature of my list.\nFlux Cloud at CES\nTransparent TVs by LG\nThe magic of LG's Signature OLED T was easily seen as it seamlessly transitioned between transparency and vivid display in the midst of ooos and ahhs! This year, LG's promise to commercialize the 77-inch wonder is a bold step towards redefining the aesthetic of living spaces. It's a statement of elegant functionality and serves as a window to a world where technology and design converge in harmony. Its inclusion on my list is due to its visionary approach to home entertainment.\nTransparent TV with Sandy Carter, COO\nAI from Pets to Pores to Pebbles\nAI's omnipresence at CES was emphatically showcased in applications ranging from pet health to personal wellness. The Invoxia Minitailz struck a chord with pet lovers, offering a glimpse into the well-being of our furry companions through advanced biometric tracking. Meanwhile, the Calm Stone's novel approach to stress reduction through AI-assisted breathing exercises represented a new frontier in personal health tech. In addition, Loreal introduced the Giorgio Armani Meta Profiler. The Meta Profiler's use of AI for analyzing skin health was another standout, illustrating AI's potential to tailor and enhance the retail experience. This diverse application of AI across various facets of life is why it's integral to my list.\nThe Calm Stone\nRobotics in Pools and PT\nRobotics were everywhere too! \u201cLanguage models aren\u2019t just for IoT anymore. Given the ease with which interfaces like ChatGPT can interpret prompts into commands, there will be a new class of tools emerging that seeks to combine the best of natural language processing and perception hardware,\u201d said Brandon Minor, co-founder and CEO of Tangram Vision said while speaking to the Robot Report. \u201cThis feels like a natural extension from an engineer\u2019s point of view, and success would add a layer of \u2018magic\u2019 to any tech demo.\u201d And we saw some magic too! The Aiper Scuba Series redefines pool maintenance with its cordless robotic cleaners. But in the robotics area, what caught my attention at CES was WiRobotics. This nifty device acts like a mini exoskeleton for your lower body, providing subtle, motorized assistance that helps with walking.\nYong-Jae Kim - Founder, CEO - WIRobotics and Sandy Carter, COO Unstoppable\nIts design is cleverly intuitive\u2014a belt pack equipped with retractable robotic arms that support and enhance leg movements. It's a godsend for physical therapy patients, aiding in movement and improving balance without being obtrusive. When I tested it, the difference was noticeable; my strides felt lighter and I was able to walk with increased speed. Priced at $2,300, the WiRobotics is an investment in health, claiming to reduce the energy required for walking by 20%. It's a standout addition to my list because of its potential to revolutionize recovery times, making it an essential tool for those on the path to regaining their mobility.\nThe Emergence of AI Companionship \u2013 Introducing Wehead\nAt this year's CES, a notable innovation was introduced by an American startup: Wehead. This groundbreaking AI companion robot presents a human-like face on a screen, forging a new frontier in digital interaction. My experience with Wehead was remarkable, engaging in conversation with an AI that seemed almost human. The developers designed it with a noble purpose: to offer companionship to those who might feel isolated or lonely.\nReflecting on George Ritzer's analysis in 'The McDonaldization of Society', Wehead stands in stark contrast to the impersonal automation that has come to define modern services, like those of fast-food chains, which expedite efficiency at the cost of human interaction.\nWeHead - Virtual Companion\nWehead aims to restore some of that lost connection, providing a 'face' and a 'voice' in scenarios where human contact is scarce. It's a poignant response to the social isolation prevalent in our fast-paced world and represents a meaningful use of technology to enhance human connection.\nThis is why Wehead has earned a place on my list \u2013 it's not just about the technology itself, but about how it can serve to alleviate the loneliness that touches so many lives.\nLongevity with the Phantom Neo by Bodyfriend\nThe Phantom Neo massage chair by BODYFRIEND represents a leap in health and wellness technology. By integrating PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) technology, this chair doesn't just offer relaxation but a daily therapeutic regimen, potentially extending the 'Healthy Life Year' of users. Its revolutionary approach to daily well-being is why it's featured on my list.\nBodyfriend\nVirtual Content Creation.\nSony turned my head at CES with its integration of Smode XR technology. Smode XR harnesses the power of extended reality (XR) to meld the physical with the virtual, opening up a world of possibilities for virtual production shoots and live events. I saw a mini movie being made with real-time compositing, integrating to create stunningly immersive virtual environments, showcasing video of larger views than were shown in a real life picture. The potential of Smode XR in transforming television production, film, and live performances is immense, promising a new era of entertainment that is as limitless as the imagination of its creators. This innovation made my list because I think that creators are the future economy!\nThe Future of Content Production\nInnovate.\nAt the end of CES 2024 , these ten innovations stand as beacons of progress, each with the potential to redefine aspects of our lives. However, my iphone is filled with so many innovations from too many companies to mention. From fostering diversity to propelling sustainable transportation, from enhancing personal health to providing companionship, the future is being shaped today.\nAnd as I reflect on the showcases that left an indelible mark on me, I'm filled with anticipation for what the next year's CES will reveal about our path forward. You must join me next year!"

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Another key question will be around attendee numbers, which recovered post-pandemic to 115,000 visitors in 2023, according to show organiser, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).\nCES 2024: What to expect\nHere we\u2019ll take a look through a selection of the biggest media and tech launches at the show, some of the key trends, and what impact these are likely to have throughout the coming year.\nCES has always been a key moment in the AV calendar, when the biggest manufacturers in panels come together, promote their various enhancement technologies and announce the newest ranges. With Samsung, LG, Sony, all vying for the same space, there will be some serious innovation on show. The big news will be in the 100-inch TV segment (a fact that was also true way back in 2019), but there will be plenty of OLED and Mini-LED activity too, as well as a slew of transparent displays from both LG and Samsung in particular, which look to be moving from the prototype stage of former years towards a more production-ready design.\nLG\u2019s new OLED lineup makes much of an updated Alpha 11 AI processor that offers four times the performance of last year\u2019s models, upscaling objects and backgrounds to reduce blur and claims to analyse and adjust colours to \u201cbest convey the mood and emotional elements intended by filmmakers.\u201d While the resolution remains at 4K, refresh rates have increased to 144Hz.\nRead more\u00a0The Best Stories of IBC2023\nSamsung, meanwhile, is sticking to the \u2018bigger is better\u2019 UHD playbook, with two new 8K TV lines at CES, along with an 8K home theatre projector. The Neo QLED QN900D relies on Samsung\u2019s 8K AI Upscaling Pro image processing engine to convert 4K content into 8K, and also upscale lower-res content to 4K. The flagship QN900D supports variable refresh rate (VRR) at up to 240Hz, while the QN800D offers a 120Hz refresh rate and no AI upscaling.\nSeparately, Samsung Display has also teased that the 2024 QD-OLED TV panel will be capable of \u201cutilising advanced panel drive technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve a maximum brightness of over 3000 nits. This makes it the brightest OLED TV panel available\u2026\u201d The new S95D QD-OLED TV also features an unusually competent glare-free display that minimises reflections.\nThe projector market continues to diversify too, with Xgimi\u2019s Horizon Max - claimed to be the world\u2019s first IMAX Enhanced long throw projector, debuting at CES2024. The projector follows last year\u2019s Xgimi Horizon Ultra, the world\u2019s first Dolby Vision-compatible long throw projector. Both devices have Google TV onboard, ensuring they\u2019ll be relatively plug-and-play.\nOf course, the battle for eyeballs is not restricted to the living room, with the world of esports commanding vast engagement. In clear recognition of this market, LG is demonstrating what it claims is an \u2018industry first\u2019 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display, an ultra-high refresh rate coupled with the fastest response time (0.03ms) of any panel on the market today.\nCES 2024: LG Display unveils industry\u2019s first 480Hz QHD gaming OLED display\nLG Display is set to launch the 27-inch 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display during the first half of the year. The company will unveil its full lineup of Gaming OLED displays in sizes 27, 31.5, 34, 39, and 45 inches at CES 2024 as it announces its entry into the high-end gaming display market.\n\u201cTo strengthen our leadership in the high-end gaming display market, we will continue to harness the power of OLED\u2019s distinctive qualities such as ultra-high refresh rates, fast response times, and perfect black for next-level viewing experiences,\u201d said Won-seok Kang, Vice President and Head of the Large Display Product Planning Division at LG Display.\nMeanwhile, gaming brand Razer is promising two gaming world firsts at CES2024, in the shape of a brace of laptops with a 18-inch 4K display that\u2019s capable of running at up to 165Hz and a 16-inch 240Hz OLED respectively.\nAlso worthy of note is Acer\u2019s Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition, which offers glasses-free 3D at a more affordable level than ever before - though whether this will attract developers and buyers is another matter.\nInterestingly, LG is also tackling the content side of the equation, displaying a\u00a0new lineup of \u2018LG MyView\u2019 smart monitors. The monitors have\u00a0webOS platform\u00a0baked in, so that users can stream content and listen to music without connecting to a PC, and feature\u00a0LG IPS 4K displays to boot.\nThey might not be new technologies, and certainly the hype around mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) has proved to be a slow-burner, but 2024 is set to be the year of XR. With Apple\u2019s Vision Pro set for launch early in the year, the market will be on tenterhooks to capitalise on the renewed interest, which will also centre around the Qualcomm XR2+ Gen2 VR chip. That chipset is apparently at the heart of a Samsung/Google XR headset, of which much is rumoured and little known for sure, but a launch date of late 2024 is often mentioned.\nUnsurprisingly, AI is set to be a key player at CES2024 - \u2018front and center\u2019 as the organisers put it, with examples from exhibitors as diverse as Garmin, Intel, Qualcomm and Walmart - the latter three likely to incorporate AI into their respective keynotes. Other touchpoints include a presentation on \u2018Great Minds, Bold Visions: What\u2019s Next for AI?\u2019, \u2018Emerging Technologies Shaping the Tech Workforce\u2019 and research that will outline \u2018Technology and AI Building a Sustainable, Secure, Superior Future\u2019.\nAI may be big business, but the classic Asimov-era artificial intelligence requires a humanoid automaton, which might not be particularly practical, but always steals the show, as Tesla has proved several times, most recently with the Optimus 2.\nCES2024 will star the Kepler Humanoid Robot, a 178cm (5 \u201910\u201d), 85kg (187 lbs.) humanoid bot with a dexterous hand capable of 12 degrees of freedom. Kepler\u2019s series of humanoid robots are apparently poised to enter mass production and commence shipping in Q3 2024, priced at approximately US$30,000.\nCES has long been a guiding light in the automotive tech sphere, and 2024 looks to be no different, with Honda announcing that it will be showing off new EVs at the event. Toyota and Hyundai are likely to make a splash too.\nCES 2024: LG M4\nOne announcement from set-top boxes (STB) and smart TV software firm 3SS features the integration of Dolby Atmos into an automotive entertainment platform, 3Ready Automotive, highlighting the potential applications for immersive entertainment in-vehicle.\nThe CES2024 demo will feature German VOD service maxdome\u2019s Dolby Atmos-enriched programming and will allow automakers to bring premium studio content via maxdome to all their cars with streamlined technical integration and certification. The Dolby Atmos-capable 3Ready entertainment platform can be deployed and scaled across Android Automotive OS, Linux, QNX and AOSP (Android Automotive Open Source Project).\n\u201cTogether with Dolby and 3SS, we\u2019re enabling carmakers to bring the latest premium video content to their customers with the most immersive audio experience,\u201c commented Hans D. Henseleit, CEO at maxdome.\nAs well as big tech names, a selection of media industry stars are also set to shine at the show, with the prospective cast including Robert Downey Jr, Game of Thrones Producers David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss, Blake Griffin and Ryan Kalil of Mortal Media, Chiara and Bianca D\u2019Ambrosio of Mirror Image Films, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, content creators from T-Pain to Wu-Tang Clan, Ludacris and almost inevitably, Will.i.am.\nRead more\u00a0What to Expect in 2024: Womens Sport Bid Wars, AI and the Olympics\nTopics\nAdvertisement\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nRelated articles\nCES2024 Review: What We Learned\n2024-01-18T13:31:00Z\nBy Mark Mayne\nThe established bellwether of the tech industry, CES2024 has delivered in its usual frenetic style.

We combine artificial intelligence with 3D sensing technology to create optics sensing systems that give real-time information and data for businesses to save time, earn more profits, and be safer.\nOur newest product is VMS, the 1st inventory management monitoring system that uses a highly accurate 3D camera to give real time data, analysis, and decision making - at a 50% less cost and at a higher accuracy rate than any other scanner in the market. The product helps agricultural businesses such as ones that hold grains in large silos to know real-time inventory without someone having to dangerously climb up to the top and physically look inside, or use expensive and inaccurate scanning equipment. This product can be customized for a variety of industries.\nOur company consists of experts in the fields of artificial intelligence, optics, semiconductors, and systems and we are committed to developing and providing insightful products and technologies to make the world a more efficient and safer place.\nExternal link for DEEP IN SIGHT Co.,Ltd\nLocations\n660, Daewangpangyo-ro\nSeongnam-si, KR\nEmployees at DEEP IN SIGHT Co.,Ltd\nYookyung Kang\nEunsong (Lucas) Oh\n\u00ec\u00b5\u0153\u00ed\u02dc\u00b8\u00ec\u0160\u00b9Hoseung\nShohruh Rakhmatov\nUpdates\n182 followers\nDEEP IN SIGHT is growing.\nJoin us and drive your career success!\nhttps://lnkd.in/guWD8Cke\nAI SoC Application Developer\nDEEP IN SIGHT Co.,Ltd, Seongnam, Gyeonggi, South Korea\n182 followers\nThe final day of #CES2024 is approaching!\nDon't miss the chance to visit DEEP IN SIGHT Co.,Ltd and discover our state-of-the-art AI-powered 3D camera solutions:\n\u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00a1 DIMENVUE: Obtain real-time 3D spatial information both indoors and outdoors.\n\u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00a1CAMOSYS: Enhance driver and occupant safety with our #AI-powered #IRcamera.\n\u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00a1ROUNVUE: Eliminate blind spots and accurately perceive specific objects.\n\u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00a1VOMASYS: Precisely weigh and measure volume.\nJoin us at the booth 9269, North hall, LVCC.\nSeize the opportunity to experience our cutting-edge AI-powered #3DSensing solutions in person!\n#DEEPINSIGHT #AI #VolumeMeasurement #InCabinMonitoring\n182 followers\nWhat a hectic time at CES 2024!\nDEEP IN SIGHT Co.,Ltd\u00c2\u00a0is showcasing AI-powered 3D camera solutions that are\u00c2\u00a0#compatible,\u00c2\u00a0#compact,\u00c2\u00a0#customized, and\u00c2\u00a0#costeffective\u00c2\u00a0at\u00c2\u00a0#CES2024.\nWhy not join us to discuss\u00c2\u00a0#InCabinMonitoring\u00c2\u00a0for\u00c2\u00a0#mobility\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0#vehicles, as well as\u00c2\u00a0#VolumeMeasurement\u00c2\u00a0for\u00c2\u00a0#Mining\u00c2\u00a0and\u00c2\u00a0#Logistics?\nExplore our latest product,\u00c2\u00a0#DIMENVUE, capable of scanning both outdoors and indoors, providing real-time 3D spatial information based on\u00c2\u00a0#AI\u00c2\u00a0#Technology.\nVisit us at booth 9269!\nDon't miss out on this exciting opportunity! \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u20ac\n#CES2024\u00c2\u00a0#CES\u00c2\u00a0#3DSensing\u00c2\u00a0#3DCamera\nDEEP IN SIGHT Co.,Ltd reposted this\nAI Research Engineer\nIf you happen to be at #CES2024 in Las Vegas, check out how AI-driven eye-tracking technology by Blink Technologies, Inc.\nis enabling new applications in 3D displays \u00f0\u0178\u2019\u00bb, automotive \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u2014, optometry \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u017d and retail \u00f0\u0178\u203a\ufffd.\nVisit the stands of our partners showcasing this technology:\n* Orbbec 3D (booth #9745 @ North Hall)\n* Leia Inc.
