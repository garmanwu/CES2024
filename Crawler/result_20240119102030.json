        "raw_content": "XING Mobility Dives into American Market with Immersion Cooling Tech at CES 2024\nXING Mobility, a name buzzing in the EV battery world, is strutting its stuff at CES 2024. Picture these folks: they cut their teeth at Tesla and Panasonic and have been honing their craft since 2015. They\u2019re bringing something unique to the table \u2013 Immersion Cooling technology, an approach that\u2019s shaking up the traditional battery thermal management scene.\nHere\u2019s the nuts and bolts of it: XING\u2019s Cell-to-Chassis (CTC) design. It\u2019s not a one-size-fits-all; it\u2019s tailored for passenger and commercial vehicles alike. The cool bit? Literally. They dunk battery cells in a special dielectric fluid. Think of it as a cozy bath for batteries, but instead of bubbles, it\u2019s all about optimal heat transfer.\nNow, let\u2019s talk about the heavy hitters at CES 2024. First up, the IMMERSIO\u2122 Cell-to-Pack (CTP) architecture. It\u2019s a powerhouse, boasting up to 200 Wh/kg in gravitational energy density and 400 Wh/L in volumetric energy density. What does that mean? More juice for passenger vehicles without hogging space.\nSimilar Posts\nThen there\u2019s the IMMERSIO\u2122 XM25 Battery System. This is the first mass-produced immersion cooling battery pack. It\u2019s not just a prototype; it\u2019s out there, ready for vehicles and Energy Storage Systems (ESS). Plus, it\u2019s been through the wringer in tests and came out shining.\nSafety? XING\u2018s got that covered. They put an IMMERSIO\u2122 battery pack through a three-nail penetration test at 100% charge. The result? No fire. This is big news in battery safety.\nXING\u2019s not just showing off at CES. They\u2019re eyeing the American market, backed by investments from Kubota and the U.S. government\u2019s focus on clean energy. They\u2019re looking for U.S. partners to spread their tech across various sectors.\nRoyce YC Hong, the big kahuna at XING, says they\u2019re bringing a safer, more stable battery option to the global market. Ida Wu, the General Manager, echoes this, highlighting the potential of their technology in sustainable mobility.\nIf you\u2019re at CES, check out XING at Booth 6857 in the West Hall. Also, catch Ida Wu at the \u201cThe Future of EV Batteries is Big\u201d seminar on January 10.\nIn the backdrop of all this, it\u2019s worth noting XING Mobility\u2019s roots. They\u2019ve been around since 2015, starting in Taiwan. Their IMMERSIO tech isn\u2019t just for show; it\u2019s patented and globally recognized. They\u2019ve got a diverse portfolio, from vehicle electrification to energy storage systems.\nThe IMMERSIO\u2122 CTP Solution is a testament to their innovation. It\u2019s adaptable, whether it\u2019s for sedans or trucks, and offers rapid charging \u2013 less than 15 minutes from 20-80% SoC. Its immersion cooling tech is a game-changer, efficiently managing heat and preventing thermal runaway.\nBut XING doesn\u2019t just stop at product development. They work closely with customers, ensuring their products meet specific needs. This customer-centric approach extends from initial discussions to real-world performance monitoring.\nSo, what\u2019s the takeaway? XING Mobility is not just another player in the EV battery space. They\u2019re bringing something different to the table with their immersion cooling technology. It\u2019s not just about power and efficiency; it\u2019s about safety and adaptability. They\u2019re set to make a splash in the EV battery market, and CES 2024 is just the beginning.\nTags:\nDon't Miss\nCES 2024 Reveals EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra: Redefining Home Power with One-Month Backup\nSony Honda\u2019s AFEELA Prototype: AI and Gaming Converge in Mobility\u2019s Future at CES 2024\nCES 2024 Sees BANF\u2019s iSensor Outshine Rivals in Smart Tire Technology Race\nVinFast VF 3 Emerges at CES 2024: A New Vision in Compact Electric Urban Mobility\nMeet the Origin 800: Yooatom\u2019s Latest Foray into Smart Modular Energy\u201d\nStellantis and Ample Join Forces for Rapid EV Battery Swapping Innovation\nLilium and InoBat Join Forces for Revolutionary eVTOL Battery Production\nSunita Somvanshi\nWith over two decades of dedicated service in the state environmental ministry, this seasoned professional has cultivated a discerning perspective on the intricate interplay between environmental considerations and diverse industries.
