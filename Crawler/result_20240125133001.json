        "raw_content": "Carrera Reveals New AI-Supported Racing Innovation for the European Market: Carrera Hybrid\nThe new cars can switch lanes and are controlled by an app.\nAt CES this week, Carrera revealed its next generation of at-home racing geared toward families in the European market: Carrera Hybrid.\nCarrera is known for its various slot car racing sets with different themes and licensed options. The company has offerings for fans across a variety of age ranges, such as its Peppa Pig First set designed for younger fans and collectible scale models of brands like Ferrari for the \u201ckidult\u201d market.\nThroughout its history, Carrera has continued to update its sets to incorporate new technology. Now, the company is introducing Carrera Hybrid, a slotless racing set supported by artificial intelligence (AI) with cars that can switch lanes, race across different track types, and be steered with a mobile phone.\nTwo sets will be released with these new features in the fourth quarter of this year, exclusively in the European market: Devil Drivers and Speedway to Hell. Each set includes two Carrera Hybrid cars, with the Devil Drivers set featuring the Red Devil and the Black Devil, and the Speedway to Hell set featuring the Greeno and the Grello. Each set also has four high-speed straights, 10 bends, and a start/end straight. The tracks can be arranged in different ways to make each race different.\nThe cars can be raced using a free app available on both iOS and Android. The app scans the race track and simulates tire wear as well as allows racers to apply speed boosts to their cars, with intuitive steering by tilting the phone. The cars also have simulated driving behavior even when off track.\nRELATED\nThe new Carrera sets are coming later this year, offering a racing experience targeted at the whole family, with both having two modes: beginner mode designed for newer players and expert mode offering a more challenging experience.\nSubscribe to The Toy Report Newsletter\n\u0394\nLatest News\nHasbro Unveils New Peppa Pig Playsets\nCrayola Experience, NERF Action Xperience Site Plans Receive Approval\nNew Star Wars Figures Blast Into a Galaxy Right, Right Here\nAbout the author\nBug Hartsock\nBug is a News Writer for The Toy Insider, The Pop Insider, and The Toy Book.

The Toy Book (TB) caught up with President and CEO Frank Tiessen (FT) for a peek under the hood.\nCarrera hit a milestone this year with 60 years of racing action. How has the company celebrated?\nWe celebrated in various ways. The launch of our own direct-to-consumer website was important to us. This is not to compete with all of our trade customers, but to give consumers and fans another resource for our products. Additionally, we have, or are still in the process of launching some special- and limited-edition products for the anniversary.\nFor Toy Fair, we teamed up with Slot Mods, the No.1 custom slot car raceway maker, and had them build a very elaborate Digital 132 track showpiece!\nWhat new products are you sharing this fall?\nThe change in the Toy Fair schedule is a bit challenging timing-wise and not every item for 2024 is ready yet. But we are proud to show new products and licenses in our Carrera and Revell ranges. We are very happy to announce that Carrera inked a licensing agreement with the most important racing series in the U.S. \u2014 NASCAR. We are partnering with the dominant Hendrick Motorsports Team and will release various sets and cars in our GO!!!, Evolution, and Digital 132 ranges next year.\nWe also secured the Batwheels license for our highly successful Carrera First range, and for Revell, we will show new licensed products inspired by James Bond 007, One Piece, Game of Thrones: House of the Dragon, and Stranger Things.\nAlso, we will show for the first time some selected Revell R/C products for the U.S. Many people here in the U.S. don\u2019t know that over in Europe Carrera and Revell are the No.1 and 2 brands for R/C vehicles according to Circana. In the future, we want to build on that success here in the U.S.\nThat is just the tip of the iceberg, so we will definitely make it worthwhile to stop by our booth.\nWhat can you tell us about Carrera\u2019s relationship with retailers in the hobby channel?\nWe are very lucky that we are well connected in the hobby channel. These retailers are basically the backbone of our business and extremely important for our hobby-grade products. They have the expertise and know what to recommend to each customer [at every stage] in their slot car or model-building journey.\nRELATED\nJust under three years ago, Carrera and Revell merged to become Carrera Revell of Americas. How has that benefited your relationship with retailers and consumers?\nAs always, when merging two companies there are some challenges in the beginning and I will definitely not try to sugarcoat this. However, the team has worked very hard to bring the brands together and to offer the assortments across all channels. I think that with a broader range [of products], we are becoming a little more important for our trade partners and it also makes it easier for them to try something new without a huge [inventory] commitment.\nLooking ahead, what is your outlook for 2024?\nLike many toy companies, we experienced an increase in business during the pandemic. We\u2019re happy with how it\u2019s continued since then. For slot car racing and model kit building, a lot of people either found their way back to these hobbies or discovered them for the first time and are now sticking with them. Our job is to build on that, attract even more fans \u2026 and keep our current fans happy. We are happy to have one foot planted in the hobby and specialty side of the business, while the other foot is in the mass market. Both sides will see a lot of NEW from us next year.
