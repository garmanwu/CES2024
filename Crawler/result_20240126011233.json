Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best wearable and fitness tech of CES 2024: from smart rings to AI coaches\nWomen-first tech and automatic glasses stood out at CES\nEvery year CES \u2013 the Consumer Electronics Show \u2013 introduces us to a treasure trove of innovative technologies, and that\u2019s no truer than in the fitness and wearables category. CES 2024 has been no different.\nAt last year\u2019s conference, we saw a displayless smartwatch, smart beds for athletes, and an at-home pee tester (kinda yucky, but potentially a handy health accessory).\nThis year we (thankfully) don\u2019t have toilet-based gadgets we want to highlight, but there are plenty of other fitness and wearable gadgets we\u2019ve loved finding out more about \u2013 and have even got hands-on time with to see if they can live up to the hype.\nHere are some of the best wearables and fitness tech from CES 2024 including a glove that counters Parkinson\u2019s tremors, fitness headphones with an in-built AI coach, and a smartwatch we could see surviving anything.\nSmartwatches at CES 2024\nThere\u2019s usually a handful of smartwatches on display at CES, typically sleek sophisticated-looking things that combine fitness tracking with an elegant electronic timepiece.\nThat\u2019s true of the newly announced Garmin Lily 2 which boasts a \u201cpetite, fashionable\u201d smartwatch design \u2013 coming in at just 20.6g \u2013 and a hidden display that shows a patterned background until tapped. It\u2019s also plenty useful with connected GPS \u2013 although no built-in GPS, which would have been a huge upgrade for runners and cyclists over the original Garmin Lily \u2013 as well as five days of battery life, sleep scores, menstrual cycle tracking, and a pulse oximeter for checking your blood oxygen levels. It\u2019s available now for $249.99 / \u00a3249.99, with Australia prices TBC.\nGarmin also launched the HRM-Fit heart rate monitor which has been tailored specifically for people who wear medium and high-support sports bras. It offers all the same real-time workout information tracking in a package that should be more comfortable for sports bra wearers than traditional Garmin heart rate monitors.\nIf you instead want a smartwatch that looks like it would survive a nuclear explosion there\u2019s the Casio G-Shock Rangeman GPR-H1000. It features heart rate monitoring, a pulse oximeter, built-in GPS, and Casio's Triple Sensor for measuring altitude, compass bearing, and temperature. Casio\u2019s smartwatch can also give you sunrise and sunset times, and global tide data making though it comes at a price. When it launches on January 20 it\u2019ll set you back $500 / \u00a3449 (around AU$750).\nSmart rings at CES 2024\nSmart rings are becoming all the rage \u2013 they\u2019re like fitness watches but pack all of their health-tracking sensors into a ring that\u2019s a lot less bulky and distracting.\nThe 4g Amazfit Helio ring is coming to claim Oura\u2019s crown at the top of our best smart rings list with its promises of detailed sleep tracking and readiness scoring that could help you improve your running and cycling workouts. Though to access its premium analysis features you\u2019ll need to pay $69.99 (approx \u00a375 / AU$105) per year.\nConversely, the women-first Evie smart ring offers a one-and-done approach. The ring is not only packed with helpful trackers for sleep, blood oxygen, and heart health, but it also has an AI that can look at this info as well as logs related to your menstrual cycle, mood, and activity levels to provide insight on what has positive impacts on your health \u2013 such as noting that the days you log more steps than average are days your mood is higher.\nIt even has an open ring design to account for the changes in women\u2019s finger sizes at different points in their menstrual cycle. The Evie smart ring launches later this January but only in the US for $269.\nFitness headphones at CES 2024\nMusic can be a powerful workout tool with powerful tunes helping you to push through a workout, or distract you from how tired you\u2019re feeling on your long run. But Mojawa\u2019s new bone conduction headphones want to take things further with an AI sports trainer who can help you take your training further, apparently.\nWith vibration-based training guidance Mojawa\u2019s HaptiFit Terra headphones\u2019 AI \u201celevate workouts into complete training sessions with automatically generated exercise plans.\u201d How this looks in practice is anyone\u2019s guess but when it launches in the next couple of months \u2013 the official release date is Q1 2024 \u2013 we should find out.\nThe gadget is currently on presale for $199.99 / \u00a3239.99 \u2013 slightly cheaper than the $299.99 retail price (Australian and UK release prices to come in the future). On top of the AI you\u2019ll get headphones with an IP68 water resistance rating and 32GB of on-board music storage that\u2019s controlled by pressure-sensitive haptic controls.\nSennheiser also introduced a new set of Momentum Sport headphones, with built-in fitness tracking and PPG heart rate sensor, as well as the full range of Polar's impressive fitness metrics. The Sport buds go on sale on the 9th of April with a selling price of $329.95 / \u20ac329.99 / around AU$492.14.\nHealth wearables at CES 2024\nThe most innovative health tech shown off at CES can be a total game changer for the people it helps. In the case of the GyroGlove it\u2019s helping to give people suffering from Parkinson's some of their independence back.\nBy working to counter her tremors Roberta Wilson-Garrett \u2013 a person with Parkinson\u2019s \u2013 told us that she can make herself a cup of tea, button her shirt, and eat something using utensils thanks to the FDA Class-1 approved glove. In a live demonstration, we saw a stark contrast between her ability to draw with and without the glove.\nThe GyroGlove is available to buy right now \u2013 though each hand will cost you $5,899 (around \u00a34,600 / AU$8.800) \u2013 but CES is also a chance to see the future of health tech, like the Vixion 01 specs.\nThis sci-fi visor isn\u2019t yet another Apple Vision Pro competitor. They\u2019re glasses that can automatically correct your vision so whatever you\u2019re looking at is always in focus. The clear advantage being you\u2019d only need to buy one pair of specs for the rest of your life. If your vision changes the Vixion 01 will adjust itself so you can still see with perfect clarity. The only downside is we don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll release, or how much it\u2019ll be at launch.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

The smart ring by Zepp Health is said to provide integrated data with Amazfit smartwatches and the Zepp App. It is likely to compete with the likes of\u00a0Noise Luna Ring and\u00a0Boat Smart Ring. The company has confirmed that the Amazfit Helio Ring will be available for purchase later this year. Notably, other leading brands like Samsung and Apple have also previously been tipped to be working on their versions of smart rings that are also expected to hit the markets soon.\nZepp Health introduced the\u00a0Amazfit Helio Ring at CES 2024. It is confirmed to be available for purchase in early Spring 2024. The company has revealed the design of the smart ring but has not yet disclosed many specifications of the device. The official website claims that the ring can be used alongside an Amazfit smartwatch and the data from both the smart wearables will be integrated with the Zepp App.\nThe Amazfit Helio Ring is confirmed to offer 10 ATM water resistance, according to the information available on the fact sheet attached in the\u00a0CES press kit. It is said to support athletes in their training and complete recovery after a break or an injury. Its titanium alloy material claims to offer durability and lightness. The ring is offered in two sizes - the size 10 ring weighs 3.8g while the size 12 weighs 4g.\nWith the help of the Zepp App, Amazfit Helio Ring users are said to be able to monitor heart rate variability, sleeping heart rate, breathing, blood oxygen saturation level, and body temperature. The ring is also said to act as a sleep-tracking device. It is also equipped with Electrodermal Activity (EDA) sensors that are claimed to track\u00a0physical emotional stress indicators like sweat to help offer a reading on the users' emotional health.\nLike most other fitness trackers, the Amazfit Helio Ring will also allow steps and calorie monitoring. Notably, it does not support GPS connectivity. The ring claims to offer a reading of the user's cardiovascular health by \"tracking the time it takes for the heart rate to return to normal in three minutes after exercise.\" Although the company hasn't confirmed the battery capacity of the ring, the FAQ document shows that internal testing shows it to offer a battery life of up to five days.\nFor the latest tech news and reviews, follow Gadgets 360 on X, Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads and Google News.

Take the rings unveiled at this year's CES, the tech industry's largest consumer technology convention of the year: We saw rings that track your menstrual cycle and use AI to offer relevant health insights, rings that hone in on athletic recovery data, and rings that make tracking health information more simple and efficient.\nAlso: CES 2024: What's next in tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nSmart rings are the future wrapped around your finger: They can track your sleep, function as a form of NFC payment, and provide by-the-minute health insights without the bulkiness and additional screen of a smartwatch. Plus, they're far more discreet than other wearables.\n\"Smart rings offer an opportunity to seamlessly track one's health with a small, screenless form factor,\" says Stacy Salvi, vice president of product and strategy at Movano Health, makers of the Evie smart ring. \"Consumers want an easy way to wear a device for an extended period without having to charge daily, which is the case with many smart watches. Because there is no screen on a ring, data is viewed exclusively on an app, which has more real estate to communicate the critical metrics in an engaging and fun way while also being informative.\"\nWith all these new products unveiling and launching, 2024 is ramping up to be the year of the smart ring. And we're just getting started: The smart ring market size is expected to grow to an over $1 billion industry by 2032, according to a recent report by DataHorizzon Research. Expect more smart rings to hit the market this year and next, with larger tech brands (did we see that Samsung might be entering the smart ring race with a new Galaxy Ring?) throwing their hat in the ring -- pun intended.\nAlso: The best smart rings\nI've rounded up the most notable smart rings on display at CES that ZDNET's team got to check out, and that are worthy of your attention this year. Some are available to buy now, and some are available for purchase later this year.\nThe top smart rings of CES\nMovano Evie Ring\nWe've been excited about the Evie Ring since last year, when Movano unveiled its product concept at CES 2023. The Evie Ring is the first women-focused smart ring that uses the health data it tracks to offer up a holistic view of overall health and wellness -- and it just earned a 2024 CES Innovation Honoree Award.\nWhat differentiates the Evie Ring from other smart rings on the market is its women-specific data that pairs with an AI engine to offer predictive insights into a women's menstrual health, mood, sleep, physical activity, and more. Plus, the ring includes a notable smart metric, called Daily Summary, which offers up an at-a-glance activity and recovery graphic for succinct health data visualization (so you can spend less time parsing rogue graphs together and more time digging into health solutions with tangible results).\nAlso:\u00a0This women's smart health ring uses AI to analyze menstrual and sleep data\nNo additional subscription nor membership is necessary with this $269 ring. Get the smart ring in silver, gold, or rose gold. The product is expected to ship later this month.\nRingConn Smart Ring\nMost smart rings come with a subscription you have to buy in addition to the already-expensive smart ring itself. The subscriptions, like the Oura Ring membership, tend to offer supplementary insights on sleep data, personalized health insights, and a glance at your health trends over time.\nLike the Evie Ring, RingConn's smart ring sidesteps the subscriptions and offers you comprehensive health data without the additional cost of a subscription. At $279, RingConn's Smart Ring comes in Moonlit Silver, Midnight Black, and Pale Gold, with a titanium build and a matte finish. Along with a one-week battery life, the ring also comes with a portable charging case that can keep your ring powered for up to 150 days.\nAlso: RingConn takes on Oura with an impressive subscription-free smart ring\nZDNET contributing writer Matt Miller got his hands on the RingConn smart ring, and praised it for its substantial battery life and powerful smartphone app.\nAmazfit Helio Ring\nWith Amazfit's Helio Ring, all your sleep and health data is stored in one app -- no smartwatch necessary. \"When you wake up, you can put on the watch while wearing the ring -- or not -- and all of your health, wellness, and sports activity data will be synced and available in the Zepp app (formerly Amazfit) on your smartphone,\"ZDNET contributing writer Matt Miller reported.\nUsing a smart watch and the ring together is the real deal, since a watch can better measure activities and track your exercise through GPS, while the ring can monitor your sleep and resting modes. For these reasons, the ring seems optimal for someone who's already plugged into the wearable ecosystem and looking to wear both a watch and a ring for health data tracking.\nAlso: One ring, one app: Amazfit's new smart ring integrates sleep and fitness data\nThe ring will launch with ring sizes 10 and 12, with more ring sizes and colors coming later this year.\nOther smart rings to watch\nElevate meditation\nYogiFi Ring\nTrack your mind, body, and breath with this smart ring made for yogis. The ring tracks your yoga asanas, meditation sessions, and sleep.\nAnother smart ring\nDcare Ring\nLearn more about your heart health, sleep, and steps with this $200 smart ring.\nComfortable smart ring\nUltrahuman Ring Air\nComfort is the Ultrahuman Ring's main priority. Keep your sleep, movement, and recovery in check with the smart ring's data insights.\nRelated\nThe best headphones of CES 2024\nThe best smart home tech at CES 2024\nThe best CES 2024 tech you can buy right now"

        "raw_content": "News\nFinance\nSports\nEntertainment\nLife\nI predicted that 2024 would be the year of the smart ring, and CES proved it\nThere were plenty of cool gadgets on offer at CES 2024 this year, especially in the wearables space. AI headphones with built-in coaching applications, the best smartwatch from Casio that's more rugged than your average Garmin, and the GyroGlove, which \u2013 while still prohibitively expensive \u2013 can reduce tremors for those suffering from Parkinson\u2019s.\nHowever, some of the most exciting advances were considerably smaller; and our fledgeling best smart rings list looks like it\u2019s about to get bigger. At least four smart rings were on display at CES, and with other efforts from the likes of Samsung probably on the way this year, it\u2019s safe to say this burgeoning wearables category will be booming in 2024.\nFirst up, the Evie smart ring from Movano. This model specialises in women\u2019s health tracking, as well as general health day-to-day. Everything about it is carefully considered towards its target audience, from the open design that supports finger size fluctuations, to apparently using science around hormones and cycle tracking to blend \u201cmenstrual cycle, mood, and energy data with step, activity and heart health\u201d according to Stacy Salvi, VP of product and strategy at Movano Health.\nIt\u2019s a lightweight band sporting a classy design, and \u2013 similar to most smart rings \u2013doesn\u2019t even look like a wearable; it's just a chunky piece of jewellery. Inside, however, it uses medical-grade sensors combined with AI-enhanced insights, although details are a little thin regarding what role the AI plays here.\nAnother AI-infused smart ring is the Amazfit Helio Ring, which is aimed at elite athletes and offers detailed sleep tracking, heart health recovery stats, and a Readiness score reminiscent of the best Garmin watches. Rather than overall health and wellness, Amazfit\u2019s offering is firmly entrenching itself in the fitness camp \u2013\u00a0the difference here showing that there's more to smart rings than their potential as the best sleep trackers.\nThis potential is highlighted further with the Lotus ring, a wearable controller for Lotus home devices that focuses on gesture controls. This innovative ring allows you to turn on lights and adjust the TV volume, for example, with small gestures and waves \u2013 providing you own a selection of Lotus compatible products. It\u2019s all very Tony Stark, and we can\u2019t wait to see how this technology develops \u2013 although we're pretty sure that every smart home ecosystem will want one of their own, rather than there being a wearable universal controller.\nThere are other smart rings kicking around, too, including last year\u2019s Ultrahuman Ring Air, the NFC payment-focused RingConn, and the grand-daddy of them all right now, the Oura Generation 3. If you\u2019ve been paying attention to the news in this sector, you\u2019ll know Samsung is beavering away on a Samsung Galaxy Ring, and Apple has filed patents for a potential product.\nThe smart ring revolution is here. Gone are the days of smartwatch innovations looking impressive; in 2024, if it\u2019s not on your finger (or something similarly minimalist, possibly on a lapel like the Humane AI pin), it's unlikely to catch the eye. As smartwatches have grown in size and power, the next step is obviously to heading in the opposite direction, shrinking the tech so you don\u2019t even look like you\u2019re wearing any technology at all.\nI predicted the dominance of minimalist wearables such as smart rings in our 2023 year in review: and if the past two weeks are anything to go by, it looks like that prediction might just have become a reality.\nYou might also like\nI just had a demo of the world's first wearable oven, and I was dumb enough to stick my hand inside\nI listened to Dolby Atmos music in a Mercedes-Benz \u2013 and music on the road never sounded so good\nSamsung shows off a Galaxy Buds case with an OLED screen \u2013 has no plans to release it"

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nCES 2024: RingConn Aims To Revolutionize Fitness Tech With Its Smart Ring\nDr. Hao Wu (Tony), co-founder, RingConn\nRingConn, founded in 2021 by Professor Guoxing Wang and his two partners, is taking on Oura with its new Smart Ring. It is the best time to do so because the $147.1 million smart ring market size of 2022 is expected to reach $1,405.1 million by 2032 with a compounded annual growth rate of 25.4%, according to a DataHorizzon Research report.\nWhile we expect more competition in the category in the coming years, it is likely to be defined by people who understand biomedical devices and develop algorithms that work the best for each individual \u2013 instead of building generalized products with no actionable insights.\nThere are plenty of cheap smart wearables that I\u2019ve tested, which lie in the latter category. And it\u2019s a challenge to build something that aims to be a category-defining product \u2013 that\u2019s what Professor Wang is focusing on with the RingConn Smart Ring.\nThis is not his first venture, as he has helped build biomedical devices before. He built the integrated circuits chip for a company called Second Sight that worked on restoring vision for the visually impaired. His expertise lies in circuit design with a Ph.D. degree in electrical engineering from the University of California. I sat down for a conversation with Professor Wang to discuss RingConn, the future of smart rings, and what he aims to deliver with his first product.\nProfessor Guoxing Wang, founder, RingConn\nJadon Sancho Continues To Embarrass Erik Ten Hag And Manchester United\nNFL Playoffs 2024 Divisional Round Props And Betting Picks Bucs-Lions And Chiefs-Bills\nOKC Thunder: Building A Late Game Scoring Punch And Dominant Rotation\n(.. Continuing our conversation talking about Second Sight) You are a professor now. Why come back to the engineering side of things and establish a personal health technology company?\nI worked on this remarkable product and we were successful because after the impression (of the device in the eye) the visually impaired were able to see to an extent. They could see a card on their hand and could walk on the roadside. So that was helpful although the commercial side was not that bright because it was very expensive and it didn\u2019t get the insurance company to back up.\nBut that was a very crucial experience for me. I\u2019ve been working as a professor for 10 years, so I felt that there\u2019s still some engineering inside myself. I want to make products for people to be able to use them and not just to publish a bunch of papers. So that\u2019s why I started the company RingConn.\nWhen I worked in biomedical I connected circuit research with biological applications. At that time I knew that healthcare devices are very much needed. And that they can be very helpful, especially wearable devices. For example, with the retinal process I developed before it was so rewarding and amazing when people could see. After more than 10 years of research and development for smartwatches, I think it\u2019s time for us to have something better.\nFor instance, smartwatches aren\u2019t comfortable to be worn at night, and you cannot accurately track various health metrics. That\u2019s where I thought a smart ring could be the answer.\nHow is the RingConn Smart Ring different from other trackers, like the Oura Ring or the Ultrahuman Ring?\nI think we have made a better product in terms of the accuracy of recording vital signs. For example, the heart rate, oxygen saturation level and body temperature are more accurate. Although it\u2019s very difficult for the consumers to sense it, they can verify this by testing other products. It\u2019s not easy but we have tested, and we got more accurate readings.\nSecond, we have developed a product that can be used for seven days with a single charge. That\u2019s because we have opted for a low-power-consuming electronics design.\nThe third thing is, we designed a more ergonomic product. When you wear our Smart Ring on your finger, it feels much better because the design is not fully circular but a little bit square on the side. This way, it doesn\u2019t hurt your finger. The bone doesn\u2019t have a circular shape and it\u2019s a bit squarish, so our shell is also of the same design. This fits your finger much more comfortably.\nI\u2019ve used a couple of rings with fully circular design, and they felt uncomfortable with bumping against other fingers, so I agree with you on that. However, I\u2019ll have to try the RingConn Smart Ring for myself to see how much more comfortable it is.\nYeah, that\u2019s definitely there and that\u2019s the difference you can feel.\nTalking about accuracy, how did you make it more accurate? How is it more accurate than a smartwatch?\nYes. And I think it\u2019s much better than a smartwatch because it fits the finger, so you can get more accurate data from the sensors than on the wrist. The sensors are closer to large blood vessels on a finger rather than on the wrist.\nWe got it to be more accurate because we put a lot of research effort into this. Others probably don\u2019t really understand how much of a profound impact this could have. This way, we know how to optimize the hardware and algorithms and how to control the sensors for the best readings. We put a lot of emphasis on research from our side as well as a research collaboration with university because as a professor I know the upside of the latter \u2013 they can help in some other areas and make the algorithm better.\nSo I think we sort of combined the best of both academia and development to get the best algorithms on the market so far.\nOkay, on the accuracy, how accurate is the data for stress monitoring and sleep?\nI think for stress tracking there is no golden standard yet. We developed stress tracking by using the heart rate in this circle (pointing to a part on the index finger), which has hundreds of variations under stress, and we tune the algorithm accordingly. I checked the stress levels for myself and found that they are really accurate because whenever I have meetings my stress level is much higher, like right now [laughs].\nIf there is no golden standard for it, how do you know it is accurate?\nYeah, there\u2019s no standard that is agreed upon by everyone. But there are some ways to predict that you\u2019re stressed. Like by using the variations of blood flow in the index finger. People in the medical sector have found that the higher your heart rate variability is, the more relaxed you are.\nOkay, and despite monitoring 24x7, how did you achieve the 7-day battery life target?\nAs I said earlier, we put a lot of effort into research. The most important sensor is the PPG sensor, which records the flow of blood inside the blood vessels. And it consumes the most battery. It sends light signals to the blood vessels that travel across your fingers and reflect back to the sensor.\nSo we focused on finding the best way to optimize it and use the least energy possible. Another way is on the algorithm side. We divide the algorithms inside the firmware side and control the whole system, including the electronics, the wireless transmission and all the calculation of signals to make it more efficient. We developed the best circuit design and the best algorithms.\nIs it a proprietary circuit design by RingConn?\nYeah, it\u2019s all developed by ourselves.\nThere are plenty of fitness trackers that give me scores, like the sleep score or a stress score or throw a lot of numbers at me. But it\u2019s difficult to make sense of all those numbers. Did you work on giving more actionable insights based on these numbers?\nFor things like stress, as you use it, you realize what induces more stress. For example, I know my stress levels increased during the meeting, and maybe I can be more mindful of it and adjust my lifestyle. Like, I know when I start meetings I should take deeper breaths and relax a little bit. So that\u2019s how I think we use the stress level index.\nFor the sleep score, I know there\u2019s a lot of sleep-tracking software on the market. But what we are trying to do is calculate the sleep score based on the duration of your sleep and the sleep stages. There\u2019s all sorts of optimal range of your sleep, and our app gives a suggested range for different sleep stages that can help people understand how the sleep score is calculated, so they can make suitable lifestyle changes.\nI know some say that a person should sleep a specific x amount of hours through the night but I think that\u2019s not true for everybody because people have different sleeping habits. And people in different age groups sleep differently. In summer, people should sleep for a different duration than in winter. We give users the option to input their best sleep duration and then we calculate the sleep score based on the users\u2019 own judgement.\nDoes it include naps?\nYes. We give users the option to include sleep targets and naps are included in the target.\n\u201cAI\u201d being the buzzword currently, is AI involved in any of this?\nYes. We use the most advanced algorithms yet for the calculation of scores and sleep apnea index calculation.\nAnd is all of this FDA-approved? If not, do you have a timeframe for it?\nNot yet. We haven\u2019t received the clearance yet but it is in the works. We expect it to come out by the end of this year.\nI see on the website, there are \u201cworkout mode\u201d and \u201csleep apnea\u201d features coming soon. Could you please explain what are these?\n(Talking about the workout mode) Yeah, it\u2019s an upcoming feature, and I would let the people wait and find out what it is when it rolls out [laughs].\nBut let me tell you more about what we\u2019re developing with sleep apnea. It\u2019s a sleep disorder in which breathing repeatedly stops and starts. It is common for people who snore. For some people, it affects the brain because you inhale less oxygen than required. Imagine if you are sleeping every night and you don\u2019t get enough oxygen then it accumulates, which can be very dangerous.\nWe have developed algorithms that can alert the next morning about how many times you `stopped breathing. If it is too serious, we will suggest you go see a doctor. I think it will be helpful for a lot of people. And it will be released very soon.\nDo you see the RingConn Smart Ring making a difference in people\u2019s lives?\nYes. I think people are not satisfied by smartwatches. And I think our Smart Ring can do a much better job because it can get more accurate signals from the finger. Plus, they can do more with it, like detect sleep apnea. We are working on more features and they are coming soon.\nI think we can make a big difference because instead of just making sort of a toy like some smart bands or smartwatches, we are offering accurate tracking.\nRight now, your app is free but the competitors like Oura and Ultrahuman have paid subscriptions. Do you plan on introducing a paid tier on the RingConn app?\nYes. But for all the basic functions, we are going to keep it free. We\u2019ll explore the paid tier will offer more advanced functions like sleep apnea but we\u2019ll decide based on the driving cost how the market reacts to them. However, all the features currently available are going to be free.\nThe Smart Ring is your first product. Do you plan on expanding the product line in the future?\nAt this stage, I think the Smart Ring is such a wonderful product and there are a lot of possibilities to explore. But for now, we are going to focus on this.\nRingConn Smart Ring\nAdding to this, I talked more about RingConn\u2019s R&D efforts with co-founder Dr. Hao Wu (Tony), who is an Assistant Professor at Shenzhen University, transcript below:\nHow is the RingConn Smart Ring different from other rings in the market from R&D perspective? I\u2019ve learned that the circuit design has been done in-house How does that help me as a user?\nOn the RingConn Smart Ring, we have PPG sensors, a skin temperature sensor, and an accelerometer. It\u2019s both the hardware and software that distinguishes it from other wearables.\nWe designed the circuits ourselves with a very good design of the LED distribution so they can take high-quality measurements. And because of this we could tune the software for better accuracy.\nYou\u2019re seeking FDA approval and adding sleep apnea detection to the Smart Ring. Does the feature\u2019s rollout depend on getting the approval?\nYes, we have applied for two FDA certifications and one is for sleep apnea detection. Both of them are likely to be issued by the end of this year (2024). And no, we do not need to wait for FDA approval to roll out the feature. It is already available in open beta for our users. We are still testing it.\nDo you plan on introducing blood pressure monitoring and blood sugar monitoring?\nTwo different things. For blood pressure measurement, we have already been researching it for like seven years. We have had some good progress in the last year. We are doing the blood pressure measurements on the ring. As for blood sugar tracking, it\u2019s not easy and we haven\u2019t started any research on it yet.\nDo you have the hardware for blood pressure monitoring on this version?\nNo, we are thinking of introducing it in the next version.\nThe conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\nI\u2019m currently using the RingConn Smart Ring for review. My initial impressions are positive, and the flatter sides do make a difference in making it more comfortable."

Designed for athletes, it's one of the lightest smart rings with health and performance tracking features. Its global release date and pricing are awaited.\nEditorji News Desk\nThe Amazfit Hello Ring has been introduced at CES 2024, marking Amazfit's entry into the competitive smart ring market. This new device is aimed at athletes, focusing on performance tracking and health monitoring. It's a significant step for Amazfit, a brand known for its wearable technology.\nAmazfit Hello Ring Launch Date and Availability\nThe launch of the Amazfit Hello Ring is scheduled for early spring 2024. This means it could be available worldwide either at the end of the first quarter or at the beginning of the second quarter of 2024. However, Amazfit hasn't confirmed if the Hello Ring will be launched in India, where local brands like Noise and boAt have already released similar products.\nAmazfit Hello Ring\nDesign and Features:\nOne of the standout features of the Hello Ring is its weight. It's one of the lightest smart rings in the market. The size 10 ring weighs about 3.8 grams, while the size 12 is slightly heavier at 4 grams. This lightweight design is a big advantage, making it comfortable for users to wear the ring for a long time.\nThe Hello Ring is also designed with a water resistance of 10 ATM, as per internal tests. This feature is especially useful for swimmers and people who engage in water-related sports. Amazfit plans to have the ring undergo third-party testing and certification to verify this feature.\nTracking and Monitoring for Health and Fitness\nIn terms of health features, the Amazfit Hello Ring offers a range of health monitoring capabilities. These include keeping tabs on your heart rate, monitoring stress levels, tracking sleep patterns, and checking blood oxygen saturation (SpO2).\nTo use these features, users need to enable them through the Zepp app. The ring also requires users to complete a 3-kilometer run to start collecting data for predictions.\nAdditionally, the Hello Ring can be paired with an Amazfit sportswatch. This pairing enhances the ring's capabilities, allowing it to offer more detailed insights. Even without a sportswatch, the ring can still provide useful health and fitness information.\nWrap Up\nIn conclusion, the Amazfit Hello Ring represents a new and exciting option in the wearable technology market, especially for athletes and health enthusiasts.\nWith its release date in early 2024, its position as the lightest smart ring, and its focus on performance tracking and health monitoring, the Hello Ring is a promising new product.\nThe price of the ring is still to be announced, and many are looking forward to more details as the launch date gets closer.\nAlso watch: CES 2024: Samsung unveils \"AI for All\" Vision; From accessible appliances to connected cars\nUp Next\nCES 2024: Amazfit Hello Ring announced: Lightweight, performance-focused smart ring for athletes.\nOnePlus 12 vs OnePlus 12R: Upgrading your OnePlus? here's what you need to know\nBeyond Smart: Samsung Galaxy S24 series elevates AI to new heights\nGoogle Pixel 8 and 8 Pro now available in Mint green colour\nSamsung Galaxy S24, S24 Plus, S24 Ultra now delivered in 10 minutes with Blinkit\nMotorola confirms Android 14 update for these smartphones: Is yours included?\nMore videos\nMoto Razr 40 and Razr 40 Ultra now up to \u20b920,000 cheaper in India\nHow to download and send Republic Day 2024 stickers on WhatsApp: A complete guide\nWordle 950 Hints and answer for January 24, 2024: Embracing the challenge\nQuordle 731 hints and answers for January 25, 2024: Boosting language skills\nApple iOS 17.3 update introduces Stolen Device Protection: Check how to enable on your iPhone\nMoto G54 5G now more affordable: Price dropped by \u20b93,000 in India\nFree Fire OB43 update available now: Everything you need to know and how to download\nPixel 9 Pro leaked: Smaller display, flat edges, redesigned camera, and more\nOnePlus 12 vs Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra: Flagship killer vs true flagship; compare specs, price in India\nOnePlus Buds 3 launched in India: Flagship features like ANC and 3D audio at a mid-range price\nCategories\nAbout us\nEditorji is a popular short video news and information platform based in India.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

If you buy through our links, we may get a commission. Reviews ethics statement\nCES 2024 Health Tech: The Things That May Actually Improve Your Wellness\nFrom improvements in diabetes care to glasses that help you hear, here are the highlights from the world's largest consumer electronics show.\nThese Nuance Audio glasses look like a regular pair, but they're built to help you hear better.\nNew health and wellness technology can be an attractive sell because, well, who doesn't want to feel better? At CES this year, some of the new devices and concepts showcased marketed as a means to improve your health -- or at least make you look cool trying to do it.\nHere's a round-up of some of the best and most interesting health and wellness technology that's come out of\u00a0CES\u00a0this year so far. In similar news, read on for\u00a0futuristic concepts, products you can\u00a0already buy today\u00a0and our best of show picks\u00a0for 2024.\nA smart ring with a new edge\nThere's a new smart ring in town: the Evie health tracker. Made by Movano, it won CNET's admiration at CES this year, earning a spot in our best of show. In a world of smartwatches and wearables, what sets Evie apart is that it was designed with women's health in mind, from the fit of the ring itself to the way it interprets data in a holistic way. For more on the Evie ring -- including how comfortable it was to wear, how it tracked steps and more -- check out Bridget Carey's hands-on test of Evie on the CES floor.\nThe Evie ring and app are currently only compatible with iOS, with plans to support Android in the near future. You can order one now for $269 (in gold, rose gold or silver colors) with shipments expected later this month. Unlike Oura ring, there is no monthly subscription for an Evie ring -- just the one-time payment.\nAn all-in-one thermometer, stethoscope and heart health checker\nBeamO is a four-in-one health-scanning device.\nThe BeamO from Withings is a Wii-looking thermometer that does it all -- takes your temperature, checks your heart rate and blood oxygen levels, and even works as a stethoscope.\nDesigned to be easy to carry and light to hold, the BeamO is entering the market post-pandemic, where telemedicine visits are still the norm. But increasingly, patients want quick access to basic health information that providers may normally collect in-office.\nBeamO could help anyone who wants easy insights into their heart and lung health (and temperature, of course) monitor their baselines and share information with their health care providers. Following expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nGlasses that let you hear better\nThe Nuance Audio glasses can amplify the voice of the person you're speaking to.\nThe Nuance Audio glasses from EssilorLuxottica were made for people with mild or moderate hearing loss -- those who notice they have some trouble hearing in noisy, busy places. They have technology built right into the glasses frames that will amplify sound. To adjust the volume, users can tweak the glasses themselves or use the companion app. You'll also be able to add your vision prescription to the lenses.\nA pair of Nuance Audio specs will provide a different way for people to improve their hearing. Even now that the FDA is allowing over-the-counter hearing aid sales so people can get a hearing aid without a prescription,\u00a0high cost and perceived stigma of wearing hearing aids are still barriers to treatment for many people. (There's no official word on how much the Nuance Audio glasses will cost yet.)\nNuance Audio glasses are expected to be available in late 2024 in the US. They aren't a replacement for hearing aids, but EssilorLuxottica is registering them with the FDA as an over-the-counter hearing device.\nRead more: This Smart Bed Adjusts to Your Body With AI Sensors and Strings\nAn air conditioner for your neck\nA personal air conditioner that travels with you.\nTorras, which makes wearable air conditioners for your neck, announced a new model of its personal air condition at CES this year, the Coolify Cyber. While it's not a new concept this year (there are other models available for sale), it's the company's latest version of an air conditioning product that fits around the back of your neck to keep you cool -- not a bad choice for a hot day walking around, and one of the more approachable wellness items.\nIt works by running an electrical current between a semiconductor and a ceramic cooling plate that sits on your neck. CNET's Nick Wolny had a chance to test out the Torras' neck air conditioner, describing it as a positive experience that was \"a blast of cold air, but like a neck pillow that energized me.\"\nA toothbrush that tells you when you're doing it wrong\nThis year at CES, the Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush made its debut as a smart toothbrush that uses bone-conduction technology and an AI voice guide to give you tips on your brushing technique, including whether you're brushing too hard or focusing too much time in one part of your mouth. It has five brush modes designed for specific needs or times of the day and an interactive touch screen that can tell you where you missed a spot. The Oclean X Ultra will launch in the US this fall and costs $130.\nCES 2024: Kitchen Tech and Cooking Tools That Caused the Biggest Stir\nImproved diabetes tech\nA mold of the Mobi, Tandem's tiny automated delivery system.\nThe big diabetes device companies had a presence at CES this year, showcasing the latest improvements in technology for people with Type 1 diabetes. Last summer, Tandem\u00a0announced FDA clearance\u00a0of its Mobi insulin pump, the world's smallest automated insulin delivery system. And at the 2024 CES, the company brought it in for a showcase ahead of its anticipated launch early this year.\nAbbott and Tandem also just announced a US integration of Abbott's newest continuous glucose monitor, the\u00a0FreestyleLibre 2 Plus Sensor, with Tandem's T:slim X2 insulin pump.\nAt launch, the Mobi will be compatible with the Dexcom G6 sensor, with Dexcom G7 and Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor compatibility anticipated to follow, according to a press release.\nNew at-home smart UTI test\nVivoo's at-home urine tests pair with an app.\nUrinary tract infections (known as\u00a0UTIs) are a common reason for a trip to the doctor.\u00a0Vivoo, a health tech company that makes at-home urine tests with a partnered app, announced a new UTI test that gives users quick results that are stored on an app.\nVivoo said in a press release it's able to give UTI results through its \"deep learning image processing technology\" through its software.\nTo use it, download the Vivoo app first. Then, pee on the strip and scan it to get results on the app. Because it's stored on an app, you can easily share results with a health care provider to get a prescription or treatment.\nAt-home urine strips (even for UTIs) aren't new to DIY health care, but having a test available to people in partial app form can be useful for those who want more privacy or people who want to narrow down the cause of their symptoms. It also follows in the footsteps of other pee-based CES tech, like last year's toilet sensor from Withings.\nRead more: Anti-Snore Pillows at CES: This Smart Pillow Senses When You're Sawing Logs\nA wearable that's supposed to track your focus and agility\nThe Pison Ready wristband\nWe're all used to companies boasting their health-tracking and fitness-monitoring features, but what about how clear-headed and mentally sharp you're feeling? This year at CES, makers of the Pison Ready claim they can track just that.\nThe Pison Ready is made to measure metrics of mental focus, reaction time and agility through tests taken on your wrist, as demonstrated by CNET's Lisa Eadicicco. Pison Technology says it can zone in on your mental alertness by detecting neurological signals from the brain that suggest mental acuity. The company initially based its neural biosensing technology to benefit amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.\nThe Pison Ready launches in February and will be available as a subscription -- three months for $59, a year for $119 and two years for $199. It's not clear right now how practical it'll be for most people -- or how accurately it shows people's real-time ability to stay focused -- but the availability of a wearable that measures more heady wellness metrics, as opposed to more strict health metrics like blood oxygen or sleep stages, could potentially be an advancement in the wellness bubble in 2024.\nRead on for some of the wackiest tech at CES this year,\u00a0which robots we saw there, and the\u00a0most cutting-edge tech for 2024.\nOther Wellness Guides\nPersonal Care\nSleep\nFitness\nNutrition\nMedical and Mental Health"

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
