        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design.

Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power.

Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable.

It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024.

And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels.

However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease.

If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast.

The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

While it\u2019s been two years in the making, we\u2019ve officially reached a generative nexus point, conceding to admit that ChatGPT has reshaped an entire industry \u2014 the automated future is now. Pretty much everyone from Big Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, to itty-bitty startups with big Kickstarter dreams hailed their usage of generative AI at this year\u2019s show \u2014 whether or not it deserved to fit into the products themselves, however, is another matter entirely.\nYes, it feels like nearly every new announcement was boasting a \u201csmarter\u201d future with the help of artificial intelligence, from AI binoculars for the savvy birder, to an adjustable electric toothbrush that feels like putting an entire computer in your mouth. It was overwhelming at times, given 2023\u2019s show focused mostly on minor improvements to existing flagship products as opposed to bold new swing-for-the-fences technologies.\nStill, we were still surprised and delighted by some key product innovations, AI-infused and otherwise. So we dug through the digital noise, watched press conferences, and even live-streamed product demos, and found 32 gadgets deserving of our Rolling Stone \u201cBest Of CES 2024\u201d Award.\nWe chose our CES 2024 award winners based on design, functionality and innovation, focusing on unique products that help solve everyday problems, upgrade our life, or push the limits of technology. Scroll through to see the companies and products that made our Best of CES 2024 list.\nLG Signature OLED T Transparent TV\nAfter a ho-hum year of TV releases from usual titans of the small screen Samsung and Sony, the buzziest model at CES year by far proves that, sure, you can always go bigger and brighter \u2014 but transparency has never looked cooler.\nLG\u2019s new Signature OLED T isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel \u2014 transparent OLED technology has been around for years commercially. But for the first time in 2024, LG is making the see-through TV a must-have part of your home entertainment setup. We actually saw their transparent OLED concept in-person at last year\u2019s show, and while it\u2019s not clear-as-glass, this living room-ready model combines the best parts of their M4 series with \u201ccool factor\u201d of being able to turn your TV into an eye-catching piece of home decor (the transparent fish tank demo we saw was certainly better than anything the Samsung Frame can do).\nSpeaking of the M4 series, the OLED T smartly supports LG\u2019s \u201cZero Connect\u201d wireless connectivity: an external box housing all the HDMI connections and media players you need with the ability to beam 4K 120Hz video straight to the screen from up to 30 feet away. Overall, LG\u2019s OLED T is firing on all cyllinders when it comes to attention to design detail, and that\u2019s the transparent truth. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on LG for\n$TBD\nHP Omen Transcend 14 Laptop\nGaming laptops tend to have a certain kind of intense look to reflect all the ultra-high-powered software packed within \u2014 big and bulky designs, flashy RGB keyboard lighting, etc. HP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 may not look the part, but this ultraportable has stealthily become one of the best gaming laptops around.\nIt packs a lot of power into a slim design, all thanks to the Meteor Lake chip, with a processor\u2019s NPU that can handle running a streaming application like OBS while the CPU and GPU focuses on the game you\u2019re currently playing. There\u2019s an option of 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and the display is a 14-inch OLED with a 2880 x 1800 resolution and up to a 120Hz refresh rate (as with most of the laptops announced during CES this year, it also\u00a0 supports Wi-Fi 7).\nIf you love to game, but still want your laptop to pull double duty at the office or for your personal needs, HP\u2019s new Omen Transcend 14 shows that big power can come in a sleek, lightweight package.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on HP for\n$1,499.99\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Earbuds\nSennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 are the latest impressively-engineered wireless earbuds from one of our favorite audio companies around.\nThe earbuds might look nearly identical to their predecessors, but they feature massive upgrades to ANC, powerful enough to cancel out noisy commutes and the hum of an airplane. Transparency mode is also more natural sounding than ever before, and Sennheiser also says the buds get a respectable seven and a half hours of battery life with noise-cancelling turned off.\nBut the highlight here is a new audio chipset which gives the buds improved sound, good bass, and a crisper quality (this is thanks to Qualcomm\u2019s S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless support). There were a lot of earbuds unveiled at CES this year, but the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4s impressive technology and improved features made them stand out.\u00a0Releases: February 15.\nBuy on Sennheiser\n$299\nRabbit R1 AI\nDescribed by Time as potentially the \u201ciPhone of AI\u201d, Rabbit R1 swept CES 2024 as\u00a0the definitive AI-powered companion that feels like having a personal assistant right in your pocket \u2014 and clearly 20,000 people agreed, selling out the first batch of units in a single day, and then the second batch by Thursday.\nThe R1 is so ambitious that you can\u2019t help but believe it might just replace your smartphone someday. But what does it do exactly? Powered by a \u201cLarge Action Model,\u201d this retro-looking device is more advanced than it looks, and in the simplest terms, it\u2019s a universal controller for your apps. Similar to asking your smart home device, \u201cHey Alexa, order more paper towels\u201d, you can use the Rabbit OS to control your music, purchase groceries, send text messages, and more, all through a single interface.\nStreamlining all your apps\u2019 functionalities into one, it eliminates the need to juggle logins and interfaces \u2014 just ask for what you want and the R1 delivers.\u00a0Available for Pre-orders Now.\nBuy on Rabbit for $199\nFiiO R9 Hi-fi Media Streamer\nThe FiiO R9 is a gorgeous, high-end, do-it-all media player that will turn your desktop into the ultimate hi-fi streaming station. Like its praise-worthy predecessor, the R7, this is a streaming DAC and headphone amplifier all in one, with a variety of wireless and wired connections for any way you want to play your tunes.\nWhat we like: the R9 has a much-improved Qualcomm Bluetooth chip, even better twin DACs (now ESS Labs 9030PRO), and an amplifier that\u2019s twice as powerful. Variety is key here, and depending on how beefed up your audio system is, it can drive to most speakers or headphones, or integrate into an existing hi-fi system (there\u2019s a new HDMI ARC port, too, in case you want to hook it up to a TV).\nIt\u2019s also easy on the eyes, with a 6-inch FHD display and delightfully tactile knobs that make interacting with the R9 a dream.\u00a0Just add speakers, and the FiiO R9 will be music to your ears.\nBuy on FiiO for $1,499\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nChina-based tech startup Xreal joined the wearable AR race this year, creating smart glasses fit to give the Apple Vision Pro some stiff competition. They\u2019re taking a huge step forward with the Air 2 Ultra glasses, which represent a future with AR that feels seamlessly integrated with everyday life.\nOne thing that impressed us was how Xreal\u2019s glasses are considerably smaller and more natural-looking than other bulky mixed-reality headsets. At roughly 0.2 pounds, they\u2019re lightweight enough to feel comfortable for extended wear, and support full motion tracking (6DoF, or six degrees of freedom), so it can tell whether you\u2019re moving around in a space.\nInteracting with the various screens and menus through the glasses is a breeze, and the Air 2 Ultras as surprisingly responsive to the \u201cpinching\u201d movement meant to navigate apps (similar to the \u201cDouble Tap\u201d on the new Apple Watch Series 9).\u00a0 When viewing 2D content, it\u2019s like looking at a 154-inch display from 13 feet away. Although the success of AR glasses like these will ultimately rely on the apps that are developed for them, for now, Xreal\u2019s Air 2 Ultra shows a promising future ahead for real-world applications of AR. Your move, Apple.\u00a0Releases: March 2024.\nBuy on Xreal for $699\nSamsung Music Frame\nWhile Samsung is going full force on the aesthetic \u201cFrameification\u201d of their most popular products, one aesthetically-pleasing addition to the household that we\u2019re looking forward to is their Music Frame, a Bluetooth speaker for those who don\u2019t want their audio setup to look like an AV Club\u2019s closet.\nWhile it shares a lot, design-wise, with the Sonos x Ikea Symfonisk frame speaker collaboration from last year, there\u2019s still a lot to love here. The physical print on the front will be customizable when orders go live, so it can seamlessly blend into any style you\u2019re going for in your home, whether you use it as a picture frame, or for a modern art display.\nLet\u2019s talk specs: the Music Frame contains two, built-in woofers, two tweeters, and two midrange drivers, with waveguides that will really help create a depth of sound, especially for wider rooms. It\u2019ll also provide surround sound when paired with 2024 Samsung TVs and soundbars, or you can just operate it as a standalone wireless speaker. Samsung\u2019s Music Frame proves you don\u2019t have to sacrifice style for substance, and we can\u2019t wait to hang it up and hit play at home.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Samsung for $TBD\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 is a 2-in-1 laptop that gives you the rare one-two punch of a laptop that can double as tablet,\u00a0and one that can run both Windows and Android. More is more here, and you\u2019re getting the display of an Android tablet with the keyboard base (hybrid station) of a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU.\nSmartly-engineered with a Qualcomm processor powering the tablet and the aformentioned Intel chip in the base, the two pieces can function independently when you need them to. When connected to an external monitor, the base can serve as a standalone Windows machine. Need a more portable option? Just snap off the 14-inch 2.8K OLED display from its base and use it as a tablet.\nBeing able to switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button is a game-changer, and the Lenovo is leading the way to full Windows-Android compatability with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5. Releases: Q4 2024.\nBuy on Lenovo for\n$1,999\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nIt\u2019s BBQ season year-round now with GE Profile\u2019s first-of-its-kind indoor smart smoker that\u2019ll let you inbue your own meats with festival-worthy flavor.\nNot only is this unique indoor smoker small enough to fit on your countertop, but it\u2019s safe to use inside, and won\u2019t fill your home smokey, alarm-triggering fumes. Break out your hickory and applewood chips, because the wood-pellet smoke is filtered through a tightly-sealed, advanced catalyst converter. With no filters to clean or replace, you\u2019ll get full-smoked flavor that\u2019ll infuse into your meats, fish,\u00a0 veggies, etc. and not your curtains or clothes.\nThere are five adjustable smoke levels, so you can tailor the\u00a0 smoke intensity to their preference. You can precisely control and monitor cooking through the smart app integrations, plus there are dozens of recipes available, too. A built-in probe also helps avoid overcooking or undercooking precious cuts of meats.\nWhile it\u2019s not necessary for every kitchen, wannable pitmasters will get a lot of mileage out of GE Profile\u2019s Smart Indoor Smoker.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on Amazon for $999.00\nMaster & Dynamic MW75 Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic has long been a go-to brand for audiophiles, but they\u2019re teaming with Neurable, an AI platform, to combine their premium sound with neurotechnology to help maximize your cognitive performance with the MW75 Neuro Headphones.\nThe Bluetooth headphones feature Neurable\u2019s unique neural sensors, meant to measure brain signals to help the wearer focus, destress, and improve their mental health (according to the brand, this is the first product outside the medical industry to use this kind of technology). Ideally, you\u2019ll be able to use the headphones in combination with the Neurable app to tack how activities impact your focus and get informed recommendations on how to optimize your day.\nMaster & Dynamic didn\u2019t skimp on the audio features, though. The MW75 Neuros get up to 32 hours of music playback when noise-cancelling is disabled (eight hours when ANC and EEG are enabled), and eight microphones filter out external noise for clear calls and noise cancellation. Their custom 40mm Beryllium drivers were also designed to produce a warmer, richer sound.\nMaster & Dynamic wants to make your listening experience smarter, not harder, and their effort paid off big time, with headphones that\u2019ll become your workday productivity and\u00a0destressing companion.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on Neurable for $649\nBelkin Stand Pro\nLivestreamers, vloggers, and smartphone filmmakers rejoice \u2014 Belkin\u2019s Stand Pro might just be the best mobile accessory of the year. While there have been iPhone stands before that used face-tracking during recording, the problem is they always needed to be paired with a third-party companion app to actually capture any footage properly.\nThe Stand Pro is a battery-powered, 360-degree swiveling iPhone mount that leverages a hidden weapon for ultra-convenient content recording \u2014 a little-used iOS 17 feature called DockKit that developer SDK intended to be used with iPhone\u2019s native camera app.\nThe device runs on battery power for up to five hours, so it\u2019s perfect for filming on the go. Bonus: when it\u2019s plugged into a battery source, you can charge your iPhone with 15W wireless charging. Bottom line? Content capturing has never been easier than with Belkin\u2019s Stand Pro.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on Belkin for $179.99\niGulu F1 Home Brewing Machine\nWhile kitchen technologies saw a major AI-assisted boom this year, from \u201cintelligent\u201d steak toasters, to two-minute, Keurig-style pod ice cream makers, that didn\u2019t stop the highlight from being iGulu\u2019s simple, effective home beer brewing tech.\nUsing the \u201celiminating as many steps as possible\u201d principle, if you can brew a cup of coffee, you can brew a pint of beer at home with the iGulu F1 Home Brewing Machine. Just add water in the top of the iGulu and scan a barcode to let the machine know which type you\u2019re making. There are packs for IPA, stout, wheat beer and ambers, and you can make about 40 liters of ale or lager. The machine will ping you when it\u2019s time to add each prepackaged ingredient, and then\u2026that\u2019s about it!\nIt just two weeks, your new brew will be ready to go, and it\u2019s then conveniently housed in a self-cooling keg so you can pour yourself up a cold one anytime you want. You don\u2019t need mad brewmaster skills to bring the pub home with you, and that\u2019s where this iGulu machine succeeds where other home brewing kits have failed.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on iGulu for $599 (Pre-order)\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Game Console\nMSI\u2019s Claw A1M is the first portable gaming console built with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra chipset, and it might just overthrow the Steam Deck for handheld gaming supremacy.\nWhat makes this chipset so special is that it uses advanced AI algorithms (of course) combined with on-chip video codec support to beef up the video quality while streaming games as well as improving performance. The 7-inch touch screen display has a 1080p full HD resolution as well as a 120Hz refresh rate. There\u2019s also a built-in fingerprint reader for added security, and support for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4, which will be clutch for faster, more stable online gaming.\nThere are plenty of physical controls on the device, including trigger, macro, power, volume, and shortcut buttons. But the major selling point is the Claw A1M\u2019s battery, the largest of all the popular handheld gaming consoles, which MSI says offers two hours of backup under full load.\nThe mix of the battery and processing efficiency makes the MSI Claw A1M leagues better than what we\u2019ve seen from most other handhelds this year. Releases: Q1 2024\nBuy on MSI for $699+\nJBL Live 3 Series Earbuds\nWhile everyone was buzzing about Apple finally adding USB-C charging to the case the AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) last year, JBL latest three pairs of wireless earbuds made their charging case the real star of the show.\nThe JBL Live 3 Series earbuds all feature a case with a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen that\u2019s more streamlined than ever, with a display that lets you adjust the volume of your music, change the EQ, and even switch between noise cancellation modes. As an added bonus, the case also functions like an audio-minded smartwatch, sending you messaging push notifications from your smartphone.\nOkay, but how do the earbuds sound? Well-balanced, with up to 40 hours of playback and support for spatial audio. While they share a lot of similarities with their predecessors, the Tour Pro 2s, the improved design and fit of the buds themselves just elevated the whole package.\nAdding screens to everything isn\u2019t always a recipe for success, but JBL\u2019s impressive earbud improvements combined with a savvy, smart case makes them stand out from the crowd.\u00a0Available: Summer 2024.\nBuy on JBL for $199.95\nCasio G-Shock Rangeman GPR-H1000 Smartwatch\nWe\u2019ve all seen smartwatches and fitness trackers that claim to be durable enough to withstand any condition, but Casio\u2019s tough-as-nails G-Shock Rangeman\u00a0GPR-H1000 smartwatch goes above and beyond, and could claim the title of the most rugged watch on the planet.\nThe key here is an all-new mud, sand, water, and dust-resistant design, which looks and\u00a0feels like having a tank on your wrist (it\u2019s also shock-resistant enough to survive the nastiest bump). Despite the old-school LCD screen, this watch has several smart features up its sleeve, including the usual on-wrist notifications for texts, calls, and reminders, along with an onboard pulse oximeter to keep tabs on blood oxygen saturation levels.\nMeant for not just living in, but thriving in the great outdoors, the Rangeman GPR-H1000 also feature Casio\u2019s Triple Sensor for measuring altitude, compass bearing and temperature. if you\u2019re planning on doing some serious trekking, from hiking mountainous terrain, to off-roading in the desert, the G-Shock Rangeman GPR-H1000 is the ultimate outdoorsing companion.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on G-Shock for $500\nClicks for iPhone\nFor everyone who misses the days of clickity-clacking away at their BlackBerry-style keyboard, you can bring that same tactile experience back to your iPhone with this delightfully retro new keyboard case from Clicks.\nAnnounced just in time for this year\u2019s CES, Clicks Technology is a new company debuting with their eponymous Clicks keyboard, which is compatible with the most recent iPhones to start. Ingeniously integrated into a wraparound case, just slide your iPhone into the device (it\u2019s available with either Lightning or USB-C connectively), and start typing away. For typing at night, the keys are backlit, and it runs off the phone\u2019s own battery, so you don\u2019t have to worry about charging it separately.\nWith a dedicated keyboard, the Clicks case might make your phone too big to fit in your pocket, but it does allow for faster and more accurate typing than on a digital keypad. One less obvious feature: the case has a command button to give you shortcuts to your home screen or search bar.\nIf you\u2019re wistful for the long-gone days of physical keyboards, Clicks for iPhone is the case for you.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on Clicks for $139\nAudio Pro C20\nSwedish brand Audio Pro\u2019s new C20 Wireless Active Stereo Speaker brings classic Scandinavian minimalism to the speaker scene, and manages to pack in more versatility than what meets the eye.\nIt can do just about anything with maxmilized functionality in a sleek package, including support for streaming over Wi-Fi (AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect) and Bluetooth. It also\u00a0has a built-in moving magnet (MM) phono stage for connecting a high-end turntable without the need for a separate phone preamplifier. A dedicated line-in input can also connect your CD player or cassette deck, and or you can convert the whole speaker into a mini soundbar for your TV with its HDMI ARC input.\nThe C20 has amplifiers with a combined output of 190W, all housed in an acoustically-tuned wooden cabinet. No matter your setup, the result is the same: play music through this speaker, and you\u2019ll have a deeper, richer, more immersive experience.\u00a0Releases: February 2024.\nBuy on Audio Pro for $550\nOclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush\nTo boost your brushing technique and give you a grade-A dentist seal of approval at your next appointment, Oclean\u2019s X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush aims to help you reach all your oral health goals using AI.\nWhat makes the X Ultra stand out from the pack of other electric toothbrushes is its AI voice guide that brilliantly uses bone-conduction to provide feedback on your brushing and offer tips in real time.

According to Klipsch, all of the non-passive components here \u2014 amp included \u2014 are made by Onkyo, with impeccable quality control.\nWhat does that mean here? The Flexus Core 200 delivers crisp, clear sound and lower latency to the wireless surrounds than other models.

Typically, hairdryers rely on thermal coils to produce heated air that dries your hair, but can pretty brutal to your tresses over time, causing split ends and dullness. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s hairdryer also takes a page from Dyson\u2019s book and uses an ergonomic circular design to maximize airflow along with a powerfiul motor to reduce the heat level.\nBut that added ring of infrared light from the AirLight Pro\u2019s hairdryer helps water droplets dry on the surface of the hair, but leaves moisture intact within the strand. L\u2019Or\u00e9al says this can help dry your hair up to 30% faster, use less power than a standard dryer, and reduce heat.\nWhile there is a connected app in the works where users can customize heat preferences, along with a set of smart attachments, sometimes a few smart tweaks to existing tech can make a world of difference, and the AirLight Pro Hairdryer is a chic haircare update that deserves a spot in your everyday routine. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on L'Or\u00e9al for\nUnder $400\nLockly Visage Smart Lock\nThe future of facial recognition is here, and it\u2019s right at your front door with Lockly Visage, the brand\u2019s latest smart lock. While we\u2019ve seen everything from fingerprint locking to palm recognition locks this year, this is the first time facial recognition has been used in a consumer product beyond video doorbells telling you who\u2019s at your porch, and it\u2019s officially got our attention.\nAccording to Lockly, the lock uses binocular facial recognition through two 2MP-resolution IR sensors to unlock your door hands-free as you approach. The deadbolt will unlock when you are at least 2.6 feet away, and should do it in under 1.5 seconds. If that\u2019s a little too Minority Report\u00a0for you, it does also work with Apple\u2019s Home Key, and has a fingerprint reader for other home entry options.\nThe Lockly Visage can store up to 100 face profiles, so you can add friends and family to your home profile. unlock when you are within 2.6 feet and should do it in under 1.5 seconds. The lock also has a digital keypad, along with the option to add RFID key cards, fobs, and you know, a regular old key. With voice assistnt support for Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, and Google Assistant, integrating the Visage Smart Lock is the smartest way to protect (and enter into) your home.\u00a0Releases: Early 2024.\nBuy on Lockly for\n$349\nRoboRock S8 MaxV Ultra\nRoborock\u2019s latest flagship robot vacuum and mop, the S8 MaxV Ultra, won\u2019t just give your floors the squeakiest clean you\u2019ve ever seen \u2014 it\u2019s practically your own personal robo butler, with the addition of voice calling, Matter support, and even an extended robot arm.\nYes, that arm is mostly just to push the robot\u2019s side brush out further to dig deeper into corners, but it\u2019s still a nifty feature you don\u2019t see from most robovacs. The S8 MaxV Ultra also allows you to control the vacuum with voice assistant from another smart device, and add a new camera that allows for (you guessed it) AI-powered obstacle avoidance and video calling.\nThe mopping system has also gotten an upgrade here too, and the S8 MaxV Ultra combines a new spinning mop with the previous vibrating mopping pad for even better scrubbing power. The mopping pad can also vibrate faster (4,000 times per minute) for a super-thorough clean, and lift up 20mm to avoid carpets. The vacuum itself has an impressive 10,000 Pa of suction power, which is nothing to sneeze at either.\nIt\u2019s a hefty pricetag, but we doubt that any robot cleaner can come close to the sheer level of hands-free deep-cleaning you\u2019ll get out of AI-powered Roborock\u2019s S8 MaxV Ultra right now.\u00a0Releases: April 2024.\nBuy on RoboRock for\n$1,800\nSegway Xafari E-Bike\nSegway is killing it in the personal transportation sphere, with a sleek e-bike called the Xafari that\u2019s bringing some exciting tech to the e-mobility table.\nThe biggest draw here is Segway\u2019s \u201cActive Scene Perception\u201d tech, which the company says can adjust the parameters of the bike in real-time based on \u201cperception of the road conditions and the user.\u201d While we haven\u2019t seen how it works in action yet, if it does as promised, it\u2019ll be a game-changer \u2014 but it\u2019s a beast of a bike either way.\nThe Xafari geared more toward riders who want to something to get to work\u00a0and go offroad on. This e-bike has full suspension, a 750W motor, and all-terrain tires, including integration with mobile health apps. You\u2019ll also be able to track metrics like mileage and speed, although if you mostly just want to cuise and pedal for fun, the bike is equipped with speakers and music playback for a truly entertaining ride.\nSegway\u2019s Xafari practically begs you to get out on the road, and we can\u2019t wait to ride it out for a spin.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on Segway for\n$TBD\nSwarovski Optik AX Visio Smart Binoculars\nFor the discerning birder, there\u2019s no better high-tech addition to the hobby than Swarovski Optik\u2019s AX Visio Smart Binoculars. These AI-supported binoculars can identify over 9,000 species of birds and other wildlife, whether you\u2019re hiking in the woods, or just sitting on your porch.\nWhile they\u2019re eye-catchers on the outside thanks to a sleek, elegant design from Marc Newson, under the optical hood, the binoculars are powered by an \u201cintegrated operating and object-recognition system\u201d and onboard neural processing unit. A built-in GPS helps the onboard processor decipher what type of species you might be looking at based on where you\u2019re located.\nWe guarantee avid wildlife watchers will want the Optik AX Visio Smart Binoculars in their personal arsenal, as they also take pictures and video with a 13MP and 1080p video camera. Once you\u2019ve snapped your pics, you can transfer them wirelessly to the Swarovski Optik Outdoor app on your phone.\u00a0Releases: February 1.\nBuy on Swarovski Optik for\n$4,799\nTP-Link Archer GE800\nNew Wi-Fi routers typically aren\u2019t the sexiest tech to come out of CES, but the TP-Link Archer GE800\u2019s functionality features meant for gamers make it stand out from the crowd. This isn\u2019t a traditional Wi-Fi router \u2014 it\u2019s a cool router.\nIt\u2019s also the company\u2019s first tri-band Wi-Fi 7 compatible router, with enough serious networking power and download speeds of up to 19 gigabits for the most serious gamers. It doesn\u2019t sacrifice ability for look, though, with immersive RGB lighting on its sides that\u2019ll give it a distinct look in any room.\nDid we mention how many ports you\u2019ll get here? Two 10 gigabit ports, four 2.5 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.0 port that you can use with a flash or hard drive. One of those 2.5 gigabit ports is actually exclusively for gaming, so if you connect a gaming laptop, PC, or console to the port, your traffic will be prioritized instead of fighting for bandwidth from other devices on your home network. The TP-Link Archer GE800 delivers maximum flexibility, maxmimum power, and maxmimum style, so you can just focus on your game.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on TP-Link for\n$TBD\nVictrola Stream Sapphire Wi-Fi Record Player\nVictrola\u2019s follow-up to its Stream Carbon turntable is a worthy premium upgrade for vinyl-lovers looking to go wireless with their audio setup. Dubbed the Stream Sapphire, it\u2019s the company\u2019s most high-end turntable to date, and has improved upon its predecesser in nearly ever way.\nFirst off, the turntable has more wireless streaming capabilities than ever, and it\u2019s compatible with Sonos, Roon and the Universal Plug and Play protocol (UPnP). This means you can connect it to an AV receiver or smart TV for a wider variety in how you can play your records.\nThe Stream Sapphire also sports some spiffy audio specs, with a chic, bespoke walnut veneer plinth, an Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge, and support for streaming lossless FLAC audio files (up to 24-bit/48kHz). Although this turntable is really meant to bring out the best cadences in your vinyl, it\u2019ll also give you ability to use Apple AirPlay or Google Chromecast for Bluetooth audio streaming.\nCombining analog audio mastery with the convenience of wireless streaming makes the Stream Sapphire sound as good as it looks.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Victrola for\n$1,499\nWeber Summit FS38X Smart Gas Grill\nGrill titan Weber brought the heat this year at CES in 2024 with their new flagship Summit FS38X Smart Grill, which has a never-before-seen grill feature you might just fall in love with.\nThis new grill comes decked out with everything from a touchscreen that displays real-time data on whatever you\u2019re grilling, to internal sensors you can use to track the temperature of the food you\u2019re cooking so you can make adjustments on the fly. But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance here is the addition of an infrared broiler.\nThe ultimate key to creating the perfect crust on any grilled meats, the Summit FS38X Smart Grill\u2019s broiler can be raised and lowered to achieve a quick, mouth-wateringly good crust to steak, pork chops, fish, and more.\u00a0The Summit even gives suggestions on the optimal method for whatever you\u2019re cooking and hwre you should place it on the grates to get the best results.\nFor amaeuter cooks to potential grillmasters alike, Weber\u2019s Summit FS38X Smart Grill takes most of the guesswork and uncertainty out of the grilling process.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Weber for\n$3,800\nWithings BeamO 4-in-1 Health Monitor\nNo, it\u2019s not quite the medical tricorder from\u00a0Star Trek, but the Withings BeamO 4-in-1 Health Monitor might just be a step in the right direction. Liked a supped-up thermameter, this handheld device is capable of measuring everything from body temperature to blood oxygen saturation, and that\u2019s not even the half of it.\nThe BeamO serves as a kind of\u00a0digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions, and according the company it can detect early signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more. Users can then share those results with a doctor via smartphone, and even \u201clivestream\u201d their stethoscope audio over telehealth appointments.\nWithings are currently waiting for FDA approval, but we\u2019re excited about BeamO\u2019s prospects, putting the power of an EmergiMed in the palm of your hands.\u00a0Releases: Summer 2024.\nBuy on Withings for\n$250\nXGIMI Horizon Max Projector\nThe future is bright for XGIMI\u2019s Horizon Max Projector, one of the most impressive projectors we\u2019ve ever seen. It delivers IMAX-level picture quality with time-saving setup features to make it the ultimate home cinema package.\nThe first long-throw projector to feature the IMAX Enhanced certification, the Horizon Max is their brightest model to date thanks to the use of triple MCL lasers typically found in commercial theater projectors. This means it can project a 180-inch screen with a whopping 3,100 ISO lumens of brightness, all in a super-portable package.\nBut you won\u2019t just be blinded by the light \u2014 you\u2019ll be impressed by how intelligent the Horizon Max can be too with \u201cIntelligent Screen Adaptation\u201d technology. The projector sends signals to the wall and measures the angle and the distance, accurately auto-correcting and auto-focusing within seconds. No more wasting time focus-correcting, since your picture will be sharp and bright no matter where you aim it.\nBy boosting the brightness and picture quality and eliminating unecessary setup fuss, XGIMI\u2019s small yet mighty Horizon Max is the new golden standard for \u201cpoint and play\u201d projectors.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy Horizon Max Projector $TBD\nMore News\nThese Small Space Heaters Help Warm Up Your Home, Office or Studio\nHow to Watch the Complete 'Sex and the City' Series Online Free\n25 Valentine's Day Gift Ideas for the Jewelry Lover in Your Life\n'60 Minutes': Everything You Need to Know About How to Stream the Acclaimed News Series Online\nLuxurious Murder: How to Watch 'Death and Other Details' Online\nThe Latest\nNorah Jones Returns With New Album 'Visions,' First Single 'Running'\nPost Malone, Reba McEntire, Andra Day Lead 2024 Super Bowl Pre-Game\nTrump Demands Total Presidential Immunity \u2014 Even for Acts That 'Cross the Line'\nRichard Simmons Disavows Pauly Shore-Starring Biopic in Rare Statement\nThe digital daily newsletter\nMost Popular\n\u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Leads Critics Choice Awards With 8 Wins, \u2018Barbie\u2019 Scores 6 \u2014 Full Winners List\nEmmy Awards: Winners List\nNew Photos Prove Patrick & Brittany Mahomes\u2019 Children Have the Same, Grumpy Facial Expression\nUnsealed Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0Documents Spark New Allegations against Collector Leslie Wexner\nYou might also like\nDana Carvey Returns to Work After Son\u2019s Death and Calls \u2018Riffing\u2019 With David Spade on Their Podcast \u2018Very Healthy\u2019; Chris Farley\u2019s Mom Wrote Him a Letter of Support\nMaison & Objet, Olympic Torch Designer Turns Focus to Pioneering\u00a0Solutions\nThe Best Treadmills Under $500, According to Personal Trainers\n2024 BAFTA Nominations: \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Dominates, See Full List\nFresno State Title IX Lacrosse Suit Revives Class Push on\u00a0Appeal\nFollow Us\nNewsletter Signup\nGot a Hot News Tip?\nWe want to hear it.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week.

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nCES 2024 is in full swing, and more innovative product reveals were made on day 2 of the biggest tech show of the year. And since it's the biggest show, we know not everyone is going to catch the hundreds of announcements across the more than 4,000 exhibitors.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nZDNET has cut through all the noise to bring you the most important and biggest announcements and products of day 2 that you may have missed. We were even able to go hands-on with some of these products below.\nStay tuned for even more product and big tech announcements tomorrow for CES day 3.\n1. New features coming to Android devices\nAndroid users will appreciate the several exciting announcements that Google made at CES Day 2. The most important feature coming to Android devices next month is a cross-Android solution called Quick Share. Quick Share will offer peer-to-peer content sharing across all types of Android-based devices, such as phones and even Chromebooks.\nAlso: CES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nOther new features and updates include Fast Pair support expansion, more casting capabilities to more apps and devices (including TikTok), and Android Auto integration into more vehicles like the new \u00a0Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning.\n2. Nanoleaf's impressive smart lighting\nSmart lighting company, Nanoleaf, announced some exciting additions to its smart lighting lineup, including a new Orchestrator software for music integrations. The software connects directly to a computer's sound source and isolates the response to the device, resulting in the lights reacting to an audio track's precise different layers.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight was also revealed, which the company says is a set of square light panels that are meant to be installed on the ceiling and capable of emitting 1400 lumens per square. Other product announcements included multicolor outdoor string lights with Matter support.\n3. EcoFlow's whole-house portable power station\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra generator has been recognized as a 2024 CES Innovation Awards Honoree thanks to its impressive specs. These include a power capacity of 6kWh (an entire home), and capable of 7200W output and 5.6kW of solar input. The system is also compatible with expansion packs, increasing the power capacity to a whopping 90kWh which can run power to your home's essential appliances for up to an entire month.\nAlso: The best CES 2024 gadgets you can buy right now\nZDNET writer Maria Diaz got to try this powerful generator at her own home and called it the \"Swiss Army Knife of home backup systems,\" adding that it's also \"a whisper-quiet solution, one that you can't even hear when under 2000W.\"\n4. Android's answer to Apple Watch's double-tap feature\nThe Wow Mouse app was built for Android smartwatches to act as an extension to the smartwatch, letting you control tech around you via Bluetooth with just a gesture of your hands. It's kind of similar to Apple's Double-Tap feature on the Apple Watch, but instead of controlling things on the watch itself, Wow Mouse takes it up a notch and allows users to turn their smart lights on or off or lower the volume of a speaker.\n5. A battery that charges your phone in mere seconds\nCES is all about using tech to provide solutions, and this external smartphone battery from Swappery solves the problem of a dead battery in just seven seconds. Here's how it works: When your phone runs out of juice, place it in the Swapery station, wait seven seconds, then remove it to get a new battery attachment that will last you approximately 8-10 hours, the company says.\nAlso: The best mobile accessories at CES 2024: Qi2 chargers, face-tracking phone stands, and more\nThough it isn't your most conventional charger, it could give you a fully charged battery without needing any other cables, adapters, or plug-ins.\n6. Lenovo's hybrid laptop\nLenovo announced the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid at CES day 2, and it's impressive for two reasons. First, it's a 2-in-1 device that can be a laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, or a touchscreen tablet with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ processor. Second, it switches between Windows and Android seamlessly, depending on what \"mode\" (tablet or laptop) you choose.\nAlso: Lenovo made a Mac Studio for Windows users, and it might even be better\nEach component of this hybrid device even has its own battery. It'll cost you $1,999, but you really get a seperate tablet and a laptop all in one for the price.\n7. An AI gadget that interacts with apps so you don't have to\nRabbit is going back to the basics at CES 2024 with its Rabbit R1 device that wants to essentially replace the need for your smartphone when it comes to using apps. The little gadget fits into your palm and uses AI to see and learn how a user interacts with their typical smartphone apps and web experiences and then reproduce it (when verbally asked) on a customized cloud platform.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nThe basis is really for those who may want to solve their smartphone addiction since it scrolls your apps for you. Rabbit says some of the popular apps you can task R1 with include Spotify, Apple Music, DoorDash, Uber, Amazon, and more.\n8. Amazon introduces Matter Casting\nAmazon is taking a page out of Apple and Google's casting playbook and introduced a new way to cast videos from your phones and tablets directly on supported Amazon devices. Called Matter Casting, you can now cast Prime Video content to the Echo Show 15. Support for Fire TV devices, including TVs with Fire TV built in, will roll out in the next few months, and Amazon added that it hopes to add Matter Casting capabilities to services like Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, STARZ, and more within the year.\nUnlike Apple AirPlay and Google Chromecast, Amazon's Matter Casting uses the Matter Protocol of the open technology standard so that smart home tech from different brands can all work together more seamlessly.\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 3: The 6 announcements you may have missed\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES Day 4: ZDNET's top 10 CES stories you don't want to miss"

The five-day monster Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas allows tech industry visitors to gaze into future development plans from all kinds of tech companies ahead of the official product releases.\nSo far this year we've seen some remarkable tech developments. From massive strides in the world of display technology to artificial intelligence and the robotic invasion that's expected to take over our homes, gardens and workspaces over the next 12 months. More excitingly for me as audio editor though, is the riot of new audio products on the horizon, from the mind-blowing $750,000 (no, that's not a typo) Sonus faber Suprema speaker system, to the latest products helping to streamline our audio setups and deliver the highest quality listening experiences.\nHere's a rundown of my favorite audio picks announced at CES 2024 set to energize our ears with great sound in the year ahead.\nLuxury speaker system\nSonus faber Suprema\nPriced at\u00a0$750,000 / \u00a3695,000 / AU$1,119,980 for the full loudspeaker system, these are without exception the most expensive speaker system I've ever seen. Announced by luxury Italian loudspeaker specialist Sonus faber at CES 2024, they're easily one of the most expensive products at the Las Vegas event, and the new Suprema embodies the height of luxury and the ultimate experience for audio and design enthusiasts.\nTom's Guide readers will already know of the sumptuous $1,999 Omnia wireless speaker system, one of the best one-box music systems available. But by some margin, this is the high-end speaker company's most ambitious project ever.\nBuilt to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, the Suprema demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship.\nThe lavish Suprema speaker system is built to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, and demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship using luxurious materials including carbon fiber,\u00a0wood,\u00a0solid aluminum, and genuine Italian leather.\nThe Suprema system features 2 main lute-shaped columns weighing in at 242.5 pounds each (around 110kg) configured as a 4/5-way system\u00a0with\u00a08 front-firing speakers plus 2 back-firing drivers. The full Suprema system's matching elliptical subwoofers weigh 227 pounds (around 103kg) each. They are fitted with 2 powerful 15-inch (38cm) transducers\u00a0featuring forged carbon fiber membranes and\u00a0a neodymium magnet motor system\u00a0to ensure it delivers powerful bass notes down to 16Hz.\nLastly, the dual mono and fully balanced electronic crossover manages the integration between the Suprema main columns and subwoofers and offers\u00a0versatility while maintaining the maximum integrity of the audio signal.\nIf you have pockets (or a bank vault) deep enough, the remarkable Suprema speaker system is produced on request and available to order from the Sonus faber website.\nBest desktop audio solution\nFiiO R9\nAlthough FiiO launched several new products at CES 2024, the most eye-catching is the flagship R9 desktop streamer and headphone amp/DAC. Aimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices, including wired and wireless headphones, active speakers, smartphones and PCs.\nIt supports 6.35mm and balanced 4.4mm wired headphones connections and there's a balanced 4-pin XLR output. With a power output of up to 7300mW, FiiO says that the R9 is capable of driving both low-and high-impedance headphones.\nAround the back, there's an HDMI ARC port, SD and USB ports, plus optical, coaxial, and ethernet inputs, with the FiiO R9 also supports 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and has Bluetooth 5.0 on board with support for high-quality codec including aptX HD and LDAC.\nAimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices.\nWith 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DACs, the FiiO R9 is equipped to handle full hi-res PCM audio files up to 32-bit/768kHz, native DSD512, and features MQA decoding.

The new lineup includes the Flexus Core 100 ($299) and 200 ($499) soundbars as well as the Sub 100 subwoofer and Surr 100 surrounds.\nOnkyo is probably most frequently associated with some of the best AV receivers that use power amplifiers and surround-sound decoders, both of which are crucial for soundbars.\u00a0According to a Klipsch representative, \"all of the non-passive components\" \u2014 amp included \u2014 are made by Onkyo, which bodes well for integrated speakers systems and quality control thanks to the company's technical know-how.\nThe Flexus series of products are due out by April with further innovations to the lineup coming sometime in the future. Read the full Klipsch Flexus story on their debut at\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0and what we made of the new series during a private listening demo.\nBest home cinema speaker series\nFocal Aria Evo X series\nPriced a little less lofty than Sonus faber's made-to-order Suprema loudspeaker system (top), French audio specialist, Focal, unveiled new iterations of its Aria series speakers earlier this week at CES 2024. They're still high-end though compared to majority of the best Bluetooth speakers we cover at Tom's Guide, and the updated series builds on the original Aria 900 passive loudspeaker series launched in 2013.\nThe new Focal Aria Evo X collection consists of five speakers designed for both music and home cinema, making them ideal options for the best AV receivers, although there's no mention of Dolby Atmos height speakers. The new series of speaker models includes the Aria Evo X N\u00b01 ($2,398 / \u00a31,299) compact bookshelf speaker, Aria Evo X N\u00b02 ($4,798 / \u00a32,999), N\u00b03 ($5,198 / \u00a33,499 ), N\u00b04 ($5,998 / \u00a33,999) floorstanding speakers, and Aria Evo X ($999\u00a0/ \u00a3699) center speaker.\nAs you'd expect from any new loudspeaker series, the next-gen Evo X incorporates sonic improvements said to upgrade performance including a woofer redesign for more powerful lows. The new line\u2019s midrange and bass speaker drivers are all made from Focal\u2019s iconic flax cone said to achieve a natural sound and a rich, immersive listening experience, and includes that \u2018M\u2019-shaped inverted dome tweeter for extended high frequency performance.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X speaker range is available already in black high gloss, walnut and moss green high gloss finishes. More information can be found at the Focal website and via specialist dealers.\nBest wireless streaming turntable\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe new Victrola Stream Sapphire record player comes with a modern day tech twist that offers better-than-Bluetooth wireless integration with high-quality vinyl playback to wirelessly connected speakers and devices over Wi-Fi. It looks like an ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience, as well as possibly enticing a few vinyl fans to return to the format, too.\nBuilding on the DNA of its flagship\u00a0Stream Carbon\u00a0turntable, the Victrola Stream Sapphire includes multiple wireless connectivity options (as well as wired Ethernet connectivity) \u2014 all controlled via the Victrola app. There's the ability to stream vinyl to a Sonos speaker or multiple Sonos speakers simultaneously around the home. You can also opt to stream to UPnP networked devices such as\u00a0KEF's LSX II Wireless\u00a0Hi-Fi speakers (pictured) and Roon systems (a music management solution that integrates networked storage devices and music streaming service to connect via AirPlay, Chromecast, and Roon Ready connectivity) with support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nAn ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience.\nDespite offering comprehensive wireless connectivity, there are also RCA outputs at the back that allow you to connect the Victrola to wired systems or powered speakers. The Stream Sapphire turntable has a traditional MDF plinth with walnut veneer and is fitted with adjustable-height aluminum feet with vibration isolation. There's an upgraded motor design, too, that powers the belt-driven record platter. A carbon-fiber tonearm with removable head shell and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge (worth $240) complete this turntable's audiophile credentials.\nVictrola says that the Stream Sapphire is for the vinyl lover seeking more options for high-quality wireless audio fused with beautiful design and premium components. It's expected to sell for $1,499 (around \u00a31,180 / AU$2,800) when it goes on sale in spring 2024 at\u00a0Victrola.com.\nBest wireless earbuds with audiophile sound\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nSennheiser unveiled three new products at CES 2024, but the most interesting to audiophiles like myself is the Momentum True Wireless 4. The new premium earbuds will bring the popular series bang up to date for 2024 with stacks of new features and audio enhancements incorporated into a slightly smaller design. Sennheiser bills the new version as its most capable earbuds yet, and from what I've seen, they could easily be set to rank among our\u00a0best audiophile headphones\u00a0of 2024.\nWith improved connectivity that's built on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology with aptX lossless sound quality and ultra-low latency, the new flagship will be able to stream music at higher quality via compatible devices, beating the AirPods Pro 2 in the race to lossless audio. There's Auracast support too, along with improved Adaptive ANC, evolved signature sound tuning, and an upgraded battery system. Plus, there's a Qi charging case and quick charging over USB-C.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds are expected to be available to pre-order from the\u00a0Sennheiser website\u00a0from next month, and will cost $299 / \u00a3259 (approx. AU$499).\nBest bone-conduction headphones\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra\nStraddling the line between audio, fitness and AI verticals, the Mojawa's HaptiFit Terra is an integrated smart sports device that combines haptic technology, bone conduction audio and AI Sports Trainer. As someone who's always listening to a motivational playlist when training at the gym, this Mojawa could help fitness fans to the next level.\nAlthough I haven't managed to try them out just yet, I am intrigued by Mojawa\u2019s claims that the HaptiFit Terra delivers a first-of-its-kind integrated smart sport experience for athletes to up their game, shifting fitness tracking from post-workout to real-time. The over-ear design is said to be lightweight and comfortable, providing dynamic sound and sports tracking. Mojawa says: \"The audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals with insights such as heart rate, pace, step count, calories, swimming lap and distance, and more for users to adjust their speed, set new personal records, and achieve more.\"\nThe audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals.\nLike the new Shokz OpenSwim Pro that I mentioned in my best headphones and earbuds at CES 2024, the Mojawa connects via Bluetooth and has 32GB of storage so users can train without their phone, and it's protected to IP68 making it a useful all-in-one option for swimmers. Battery life runs to 8 hours and recharges are said to complete in just one hour.\nThe Mojawa HaptiFit Terra will be available in March for $299 and is available for pre-order now via the Mojawa website with $100 off.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

The show is in full swing now, with the show floor officially open. Ironically, that means the actual announcements are beginning to wrap up.\nWe're not on the ground in Vegas this year, but we are keeping close watch from afar to collect just the juicy photography-related news and round it up for you.\nHere are the most important announcements, awards and releases (so far). We'll be updating this post as announcements roll out throughout the show, which runs until Friday, January 12th.\nThis post will be updated live throughout CES 2024. Check back for the latest announcements.\nComments\n1 piece of camera news... a lens... weeeeee....\nSo, what you're saying is that there's one thing, a Panasonic Macro lens ;)\nI was lucky enough to get invited to the show last year. It really is an amazing, and overwhelming experience. You can see everything from small phone chargers to prototype $200,000 cars - and more.\nThere were some great photo products last year, with stands from Canon, Nikon, Sony, and others. The most interesting photo thing (to me) last year was a video setup from Sony where you would attach little transmitters to your feet, hands, head and go through various motions that were automatically mapped to computer generated avatars on screen.\nI'd love to have gone this year, but no invite!\nSony's Apple Vision Pro competitor #4 link is not working for me? Goes to a dpr page not found.\nOther than the Panasonic 100mm macro lens most of this stuff is just miscellaneous gadgets with little connection to photography.\nWhat we now know as photography, cameras and the like is virtually dead. In a few more years, these tools will no longer be widely used. There will be a professional high end for sports and studio photography, but nothing else will be used for. And not just because of the rise of mobile. It's because people have become averse to cameras.\nSolid state haptic buttons aren't going to have the mass to ALSO vibrate when the phone rings. I think the announcement forgot that the \"haptic\" button leverages the existing, necessary, much larger phone/watch vibration module, to replace a physical depress switch with a very precise movement. A piezo is not going to replace the larger vibration module unless it's also able to vibrate the whole phone enough so my butt knows I'm getting a call. :)\nWanna know the reason CES (pushing new camera gear) has been dead for the last few years?\nThere's millions of good quality DSLRs out there selling for rock bottom prices, with lenses for those cams going for dirt cheap prices.\nMirrorless is a huge expense that this troubled economy is not willing to take on.\nSmartphones.\nWhy not both?\nThe reason why cameras are disappearing is that people are becoming averse to using them and to the sight of them. On the street, the camera is now mobile and not only for the users but also for the subjects. They hate being approached with a camera, it makes them tense.\nI guess CES isn't for the camera industry.\nCES is like walking into Best Buy.\nMost people are look at the new laptop, TV, phone and other newer tech.\nThere is a photoraphy section at best buy, like the smart refrigeratior, haveing a present but not as big.\nPlus these product are yearly release.\nThe amount of new laptop model reviews ae very heavy this week.\nJust got a discountined 2023 laptop model with the new 2024 announcment.\nCIPA maybe more for photography.\nHaven't you noticed the consumer cameras have fallen off a cliff since, say oh, 2012?\nYeah, just use the DPR camera timeline to go back and see how many cameras that were announced in early January through the years. Used to be a lot of cameras, especially compacts, but we all know what happened to that market segment.\nLeica BLK2GO is for architect and the construction field.\nI remebered getting a lecia field image of an as-built airport you can pick dimensions from the picture since it has 3d point builtin.\nThsi nexer version is better of course.\nMatterport seem to be close in concept and much cheaper.\nWhere are the news items?\nThey're right there in the article, at least on the mobile site. Another poster below also seems to have trouble finding them, not sure why.\nPlease add new items to the _end_ of the list instead of breaking links on a dynamic article.\nGuess how I found out ...\nhttps://www.dpreview.com/news/4871236776/ces-2024-cameras-photography-news?slide=2\nWhat shall it be?\n- Canon MS500- Apple Vision Pro- Panasonic Lumix S 100mm F2.8 macro lens\nPlease! Don't break your part of the internet.\nHuh, and here I thought this was the Consumer Electronics Show! Gigadollar industrial equipment is cool and all, but what do they have to offer me?\nSometimes leading edge tech takes a while to trickle down from specialized applications to consumer items.\nWe're still receiving dividends from the USA space program for example and that was from stuff invented decades ago.\nIt used to be consumer oriented.\nThis is a little annoying. I came to read this, and as of early Monday morning (right now, as I am posting this comment) there aren't just a couple of announcements. There are NO announcements. Why even post this article before you have ANY content for it?!?\nClick the number buttons under the picture, There ARE already some news items, although none really interesting yet\nTrying to wrap me noggin around a camera capturing\nthe path of a ray of light. How is the sensor getting enough light at those shutter speeds to form a picture. Can't compute. Brain spaghetti.\nI thought a SPAD was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSignal Passed at Danger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - absolutely not a good thing if on a train \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u201a\u00e2\ufffd\u201c\nThe OG SPAD:\nhttps://static.wixstatic.com/media/8948a4_bd538bbedef64d9685aa75fb4c9af99f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_640,h_454,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/8948a4_bd538bbedef64d9685aa75fb4c9af99f~mv2.jpg\nEven better \u00f0\u0178\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0160\nEven worse perhaps, but without the same immediate danger to life of the other two, \"A special adviser (SpAd) is a temporary civil servant who advises and assists UK government ministers or ministers in the Scottish and Welsh devolved governments They differ from impartial civil servants in that they are political appointees.\nSpecial advisers are paid by the government and appointed under Section 15 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. There are four pay bands for special advisers.\"\n\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00b1\nThose piezoelectric buttons of course do have points of internal friction or wear otherwise they wouldn't be able to move the device and offer the haptic feedback. You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you need physical response then something has to move.\nDoes an electric shock count als physical response? ;-)\nHuh, the Canon and Leica products are commercial and industrial products which are being shown at the CONSUMER Electronics Show?\nNever hurts the Brand to show off leading edge tech...\nPlus with the Canon product people already rent ultra high-speed cameras to make unusual You-Tube videos so why not this too...\nRegarding the SPAD \"photon-counting technique\", are there any applications of this for high performance film scanners? As I understand it, true drum-scanners for film use photo-multiplier tubes which can react to (I think) individual photons which is why they are considered the ultimate film scanners. So I was wondering if this SPAD technology could perform an equivalent function with a solid state solution?\nYou may also like\nLatest sample galleries\nLatest in-depth reviews\nThe Sony a9 III is the world's first full-frame mirrorless camera to feature a global electronic shutter with simultaneous readout.
