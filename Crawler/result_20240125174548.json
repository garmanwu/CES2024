Intended to accelerate the industry\u2019s path to safer advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving, and built to meet automotive-grade requirements, Atlas is powered by Aeva\u2019s innovations in custom silicon technology including the Aeva CoreVision\u2122, next-generation Lidar-on-Chip module, and Aeva X1\u2122, a powerful new System-on-Chip (SoC) LiDAR processor.\n\u201cWe are thrilled to introduce Atlas as the industry\u2019s first automotive-grade 4D LiDAR sensor for mass production in automotive applications,\u201d said Mina Rezk, Co-Founder and CTO at Aeva. \u201cAtlas is the key development that will enable OEMs to equip their vehicles with advanced safety and automated driving features at highway speeds by addressing challenging use cases that could not be solved before. Importantly, we believe it will accelerate the industry\u2019s transition to FMCW LiDAR technology, which we believe is increasingly considered to be the end state for LiDAR, offering greatly enhanced perception solutions that leverage its unique instant velocity data.\u201d\nPowered by New Aeva Silicon Innovations\nCompact and Power Efficient\nTogether, Aeva\u2019s new silicon innovations allow Atlas to be over 70% smaller and consume four times (4x) less power than Aeva\u2019s previous generation LiDAR sensor, enabling operation without active cooling and allowing for seamless integrations in-cabin behind the windshield, on the vehicle\u2019s roofline or in the grille.\nIndustry-leading FMCW Performance\nUsing Aeva\u2019s unique Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) 4D LiDAR technology, automated vehicles can unlock new levels of safety and vehicle automation by detecting objects faster, farther away, and with higher confidence \u2013 instantaneously discriminating between static and dynamic points and knowing the precise velocity of dynamic objects. Atlas delivers critical requirements for highway-speed driving with a 25% greater detection range for low-reflectivity targets and a maximum detection range of up to 500 meters. Importantly, Atlas sensors are immune to interference from direct sunlight, signals from other LiDAR sensors, and from retroreflective objects like street signs, enabling clear perception across a wide variety of everyday driving scenarios.\nAdvanced Perception Capabilities\nAtlas is accompanied by Aeva\u2019s perception software which harnesses advanced machine learning-based classification, detection and tracking algorithms. Incorporating the additional dimension of velocity data, Aeva\u2019s perception software provides unique advantages over conventional time of flight 3D LiDAR sensors including:\nAeva expects to release Atlas for production consumer and commercial vehicles starting in 2025, with samples available to select automotive OEMs and mobility customers earlier. To learn more about Atlas visit: www.aeva.com/atlas.\nAeva at CES\u00ae 2024\nAeva\u2019s next-generation sensing and perception systems built on FMCW technology offer a wide variety of solutions for vehicle safety and automation.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Aeva launches 4D lidar for SAE Level 4 trucks\nDaimler Truck announced that Aeva will supply its latest Atlas 4D lidar for the Freightliner Cascadia truck platform and collaborate with Torc Robotics to integrate the technology. The collaboration begins in the first quarter of 2024, with Aeva\u2019s start of production by 2026.\n\u201cSelecting the right lidar technology is a crucial strategic decision to safely deploy autonomous trucks on the road,\u201d Joanna Buttler, Daimler Truck\u2019s head of Global Autonomous Technology Group, said in a press release announcing the arrangement. \u201cWe are convinced that Aeva with its cutting-edge and reliable technology is the right production partner for lidar sensors and has the manufacturing capabilities to scale along with us. [This] announcement therefore represents a key puzzle piece on our path towards commercialization.\u201d\nDaimler Truck plans to bring SAE Level 4 autonomous trucks to the U.S. market by 2027. The OEM intends to integrate the long- and ultra-long-range lidar sensors directly in its production process, so trucks roll out of its plants autonomous-ready with no need for customers to retrofit sensors.\nTorc will sell its Virtual Driver technology and supporting Mission Control services as a subscription to customers. Its driving software will use Aeva\u2019s perception software, built around Aeva\u2019s \u201cinstant velocity data\u201d that reportedly detects objects faster, further away and with higher accuracy. One feature of the perception-software package is Aeva Ultra Resolution, which the company claims provides a real-time, \u201ccamera-like\u201d image with up to 20 times the resolution of conventional 3D lidar sensors.\nAeva\u2019s frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) 4D lidar, which was on display at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, uses a low-power continuous laser beam\u00a0\u2014 instead of laser pulses\u00a0\u2014 to simultaneously measure range and velocity for every point, enabling automated vehicles to discriminate between static and dynamic points and determine the precise velocity of dynamic objects. The Mountain View, California-based company integrates all key lidar components\u00a0\u2014 including transmitter, detector and a new optical processing interface chip\u00a0\u2014 onto a silicon photonics chip in a compact module called Aeva CoreVision.\nThe new Aeva X1 system-on-chip processor\u00a0integrates data acquisition, point cloud processing, scanning system and application software into a single mixed-signal processing chip. The company claims that its two new silicon innovations allow Atlas to be over 70% smaller and consume four times less power than its previous generation lidar sensor. These enhancements enable operation without active cooling, according to Aeva, and allow for integrations in-cabin behind the windshield, on the vehicle\u2019s roofline or in the grille.\nAtlas reportedly delivers a 25% greater detection range for low-reflectivity targets and a maximum detection range of up to 500 meters (1,640 ft). The company also claims that direct sunlight, signals from other lidar sensors and retroreflective objects like street signs will not interfere with its Atlas sensors.\nDaimler Truck and Torc have worked closely with Aeva engineers over the past few years to demonstrate the lidar technology in real-world, highway-speed use cases. Aeva says that the selection for the Cascadia autonomous-truck platform is its first major OEM production design win."
