It aids caregivers by maintaining the optimal childcare environment through infant health management and environmental monitoring. This IoT (Internet of Things) based baby bassinet applies video and audio recognition AI algorithms.\nThe company's patented AI technology enables non-contact, safe monitoring of infants' health without attaching sensors to the body. Through the Bebelucy dedicated application, caregivers can monitor not only the baby's vital signs like heart rate, breathing rate, and stress index but also environmental information like temperature, humidity, and air quality around the bed.

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nMonitoring People's Health Was A Notable Theme At CES 2024\nNew tech devices for health-monitoring populated the aisles of CES 2024.\nLast week, I mentioned in my Consumer Electronics Show columns that this January show was my 49th winter CES. In a small way, I have become a historian of this event. That has led people who know about my history of attending the show to ask how CES has evolved since I first attended it in the late 1970s.\nWhen I first went to CES, the focus was on VCRs and large hand-held video cameras. It even had a shady side, as the early adopters of VCRs were the adult entertainment industry. Many vendors who had new VCRs and video cameras to hawk, and even unrelated product companies would hire Playboy and Penthouse models and even porn stars to sign autographs in their booths to attract buyers. Interestingly, this was the origin of the \"booth babes\" term that was part of the CES vernacular until the show banned this practice in the late 1980s after it received significant criticism for this practice. This era was decades before flat-panel TVs and the more advanced technology we see at the show today.\nHowever, its evolution in the past 10 years has made CES a catchall show in tech that now includes smart cars, smart homes, health and fitness, advancements in televisions, streaming video, high-end gaming and just about anything that has a tech angle to a product or service.\nHowever, the one new area that CES has focused on that is a huge deal is the area of health, fitness and, more importantly, health monitoring.\nClose to 100 booths and private rooms showed products in this category. I admit that as I age, health, fitness and health monitoring have become more important to me, but it is an area that everyone should be interested in to stay healthy and fit.\nWith that in mind, here are a few of the products I saw this year that got my attention.\nWithings BeamO\nDemocrat Goldman Introduces Censure Resolution Against GOP\u2019s Stefanik For Calling Jan. 6 Defendants \u2018Hostages\u2019\nGovernment Shutdown Deadline Expected To Move To March\nEnroll Now For Early Student Loan Forgiveness, Says Biden: How To Apply\nDigital health company Withings announced its BeamO \"multiscope,\" a device that can perform four health checks in under a minute.\nThe BeamO fuses the capabilities of a thermometer, electrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope in an at-home checkup device. It is a multiscope that can do more than a fitness watch.\nBeamO combines these specialized sensors to turn their device into a powerful tool for regularly monitoring heart and lung health. It is portable and smaller than a smartphone.\nBeamO's design is to help individuals and families perform at-home checkups and substantially improve the quality of telehealth visits.The aim is to let people do more tests at home and talk to doctors on remote calls about the results, advancing the efficiency of telemedicine.\nStelo by Dexcom\nI have been a Type 2 diabetic for 27 years and have to monitor my blood sugars constantly. I am also insulin-dependent and use the Dexcom G7 CGM to help me determine my insulin dosages. Dexcom has now launched a new product that should be available later this year called the Stelo.\nWhat's different about the Stelo is its design for Type 2 diabetes patients who don't need insulin. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% or more of diabetes cases, yet these people don't always have a clear idea of which foods spike their blood sugar and what to do about it.\nFor someone on insulin, knowing their blood sugars is a life-and-death issue. For those not using insulin, learning about their blood sugars and how certain foods impact their blood sugars is a health issue that can help prevent their diabetes from getting worse. Abbot has a similar product called the Lingo Glucose Monitoring Biosensor. Both are essential tools for people with diabetes to manage this disease proactively.\nUltraHuman Smart Ring Air\nThere were many smart rings at the show, but the UltraHuman Ring Air is the only smart ring that uses fighter jet titanium that I have tested that monitors sleep, movement, recovery, nutrition and many fitness tracking data points. It has a six-axis motion sensor delivering accurate data and is water-resistant at a depth of 330 feet. I met with them at the show and was allowed to test it during CES. I found the sleep data better than the fitness tracker I wore at the show, and its step counter was very accurate.\nVivoo\nVivoo is a home testing tool that uses urine to diagnose nine important health-related data points. The company calls it a wellness platform that gives real-time data on water, magnesium, calcium, vitamin C, PH, keytones, sodium, oxidative stress and protein. A one-time purchase, which includes four Vivoo tests, is $39. They also offer monthly subscriptions for people who want or need to test more often to monitor these data points regularly.\nThis test highlights this new category of home health monitoring that has emerged to allow people to be more proactive in managing their health. This category includes smartwatches, fitness trackers, etc. Indeed, I saw at least 25 new smart health watches, fitness trackers and other health monitoring devices, including highly portable blood pressure tools and other health-related wearables.\nAlthough many dedicated medical shows have highlighted these health monitoring products, CES has become the leading consumer technology show in North America, where health has become a significant focus of this yearly event."

        "raw_content": "Emma Healthcare Wins CES Innovation Award for 3 Consecutive Years 2022, 2023, 2024\nEmma Healthcare Co., Ltd., a company specializing in digital healthcare based on advanced medical engineering technology, led by CEO Ryang-hee Sohn, has won the CES 2024 Innovation Award. This marks the third consecutive year of receiving the award, starting from 2022. CES, the world's largest electronics trade show, is held annually in January in Las Vegas. Ahead of the exhibition, it awards the Innovation Award to products demonstrating outstanding technology and innovation.\nEmma Healthcare will participating in CES 2024, held from January 9th (Tuesday) to 12th (Friday) in Las Vegas, USA (Booth #55347, Global Pavilion). Visitors to the CES exhibition booth can experience the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153AI Baby Bassinet; Bebelucy\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Multi-Modal AI-based Digital Healthcare System,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd both previous winners of the Innovation Award.\nThe \"AI Baby Bassinet; Bebelucy,\" a winner of the CES 2022 and 2023 Innovation Awards, was invented to improve the childcare environment in the era of low birth rates. It aids caregivers by maintaining the optimal childcare environment through infant health management and environmental monitoring. This IoT (Internet of Things) based baby bassinet applies video and audio recognition AI algorithms.\nThe company's patented AI technology enables non-contact, safe monitoring of infants' health without attaching sensors to the body. Through the Bebelucy dedicated application, caregivers can monitor not only the baby's vital signs like heart rate, breathing rate, and stress index but also environmental information like temperature, humidity, and air quality around the bed. It communicates with home appliances (air purifiers, heaters/air conditioner, humidifiers, etc.) to maintain and control the optimal environment.\nThe AI voice recognition distinguishes the baby's cries, laughter, and ambient noise. During sleep, if the baby cries, it plays the sound of a mother's heartbeat and automatically activates a bouncing mode to help induce sleep. It also analyzes crying sounds to probabilistically differentiate between hunger and sleepiness, providing information to the caregiver.\nThe \"Multi-Modal AI Care System,\" which won the CES 2024 Innovation Award, reflects the growing interest in AI technology products due to increasing low birth rates and an aging population. The company developed the 'Multi-Modal AI' for real-time monitoring of the health status (HR, HRV, breathing, sleep patterns, stress levels) of babies and seniors using vision AI and voice recognition technology. This enhanced AI digital healthcare uses visual, auditory, and sensor data, different from earlier models, by adding emotion analysis through facial expression recognition and sleep pattern analysis through eye detection.\nEspecially, the company is developing an AI diagnostic and digital therapeutics integration system for the emotional and cognitive care of Alzheimer's patients, utilizing this technology.\nCurrently, Emma Healthcare is undertaking various national research projects and striving to grow as a global company in the field of AI digital healthcare. The Global R&D project selected in December 2023, it is actively conducting joint research with \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcLucid\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 from Canada, who participated in the CES2024 AARP AgeTech Pavilion, for the development and service of a platform that integrates digital therapeutics by measuring Alzheimer's patients' emotional state, cognitive abilities through rPPG-based vital sensing, facial expression recognition, and EEG signal measurement. Discussions are underway with the University of Cambridge, Stanford University, and Harvard University for global R&D collaboration.\nMedia ContactCompany Name: Emma Healthcare Co., Ltd.Contact Person: Grace KimEmail: Send EmailCountry: South KoreaWebsite: https://www.emmahc.com"

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nJudging from L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s first-ever keynote address at CES 2024, beauty tech is big business. The U.S. beauty market alone is valued at $77 billion \u2014 and with the growing popularity of tech-powered skincare companies such as NuFace, Lyma, Therabody, CurrentBody and others, it\u2019s no surprise that the tech expo is becoming a launchpad for innovation in beauty tools and accessories.\nRelated Stories\nLana Del Rey Channels Old Hollywood Screen Sirens in Skims' New Valentine's Day Campaign\nSamsung Galaxy S24 Is Available for Pre-Order: Here's When the New Smartphone Starts Shipping\nAt this year\u2019s tech expo, we spotted everything from portable tattoo printers to L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s own buzzy launches (the Colorsonic hair-dyeing brush and the infrared light-powered Zuvi AirLight Pro hair dryer), and even some veritable competition for Dyson\u2019s best-selling hairstyling tools.\nWe also found plenty of great-in-theory concepts, like an oxygen mask-like prototype for treating acne to an AI-powered manicure machine that seemed to need some fine-tuning during its demo. Ahead, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the best beauty finds from CES 2024 that are worth buying (or keeping your eyes on) \u2014 see our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Fashion & Beauty\nDreame AirStyle High-Speed Styler\nAt $299, the soon-to-launch Dreame AirStyle is one of the best affordable hair multi-stylers we\u2019ve seen \u2014 and we expect it to compete with the beloved Dyson Airwrap, which costs twice the price.During our hands-on demo at CES, the hair tool base felt as light \u2014 if not lighter \u2014 than the Airwrap, and even lighter and easier to use than the Shark FlexStyle (the current top-selling Dyson hair tool competitor right now). It offered many of the same features as both the Dyson and Shark hair tools: three speed settings and a cold shot button for setting hairstyles.Accessories include two curlers (clockwise and counterclockwise) that look and feel similar to Dyson\u2019s 1.2-inch barrels, a flyaway tool, a round volumizer brush, a smoothing brush and a hair smoother. It also has a removable filter cover and automatic temperature monitoring. While testing the hair styler at CES, we found that the curling barrels wrapped hair as seamlessly as our Airwrap at home. The final test: bringing our newly-styled tresses \u2014 finished by Dreame\u2019s on-site hairstylist with a spritz of hair spray \u2014 back to the hotel room to see how well our strands held their shape the next morning. After (literally) sleeping on the results, we can confidently say that Dreame\u2019s AirStyle is poised to be the next big thing in the world of Airwrap alternatives. It\u2019s slated to hit the market this summer at\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and Dreame\u2019s website. Read more: This New Hair Styling Tool May Be the Airwrap Competitor We\u2019ve Been Waiting For\nImprintu Temporary Tattoo Printer\nPick from thousands of tattoo designs on the app, dust on some powdered primer, swipe Imprintu\u2019s temporary tattoo printer onto your skin and voila: you\u2019ve got instant ink. At CES 2024, we saw Imprintu\u2019s pocket-sized device in action and nearly expected the \u201ctattooist\u201d to declare, \u201cAbracadabra!\u201d Made to last about a day (our body art stood the test of 24 hours in Vegas), the tattoos looked vibrant and clear on our olive-tone skin. Imprintu says the device can also be used to print designs on clothing, too.\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Colorsonic Hair Brush\nAfter being announced at CES 2022, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s groundbreaking Colorsonic was finally unveiled \u2014 with the help of actress and brand ambassador Eva Longoria \u2014 at CES 2024 during the company\u2019s first-ever keynote at the tech showcase. The magic wand-like hair-dying brush uses color cartridges to make it easier \u2013 and stain-free \u2014 to color tresses or touch up roots.One cartridge can be applied to a full head or be used for three root retouches. Unfinished cartridges can also be saved in the device to be used later. Initially, there will be 20 hydrating shades available in formulas free of ammonia, parabens, phthalates, SLS, SLES and silicones.The L\u2019Or\u00e9al Colorsonic will launch this spring.\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al x Zuvi AirLight Pro Hair Dryer\nWe\u2019re already fans of Zuvi\u2018s Halo hair dryer, which uses the company\u2019s revolutionary LightCare technology to prevent heat damage on tresses or an overheated scalp by using infrared light instead of heat \u2014 a process so innovative that CES 2024 keynote speaker L\u2019Or\u00e9al became a strategic investor of the brand. The result of their partnership is the professional-grade AirLight Pro, which L\u2019Or\u00e9al says uses 31 percent less energy than other hair dryers and delivers up to 33 percent more hydrated hair and up to 59 percent smoother-looking strands. The Zuvi AirLight Pro hair dryer will launch under L\u2019Or\u00e9al Professionel later this year to both consumers and beauty professionals.\nBeautigloo Beauty Refrigerator\nCold storage isn\u2019t news in the beauty world, but LVMH- and L\u2019Or\u00e9al-backed French company Beautigloo offers a better way to organize your skin-care (and without the gimmicky mini-fridge silhouette) with its new Lite Refrigerated Beauty Box, which has a built-in thermostat, customizable compartments and a roomy interior that allows you to store bottles upright. Featuring a 5-liter capacity (a larger size is available), the beauty refrigerator uses a silent cooling system and keeps products at the ideal temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit for preserving ingredients and extending shelf-life. (The Paris-based startup says that Dior and Shiseido are among clients.)\nPanasonic Palm Shaver\nGrooming on the go just got easier with Panasonic\u2019s Palm Shaver, a pocket-friendly device equipped with a five-blade system for smooth, close shaves for all beard textures. We love that the tool is made from sea mineral-derived Nagori, a sustainable material that Panasonic says helps reduce plastic usage by 40 percent compared to conventional grooming products. The tool will launch in September.\nAmore Pacific Lipcure Beam\nA winner of the CES 2024 Innovation Award in Digital Health, Korean beauty giant Amore Pacific\u2019s Lipcure Beam is a pout care multi-tasker that diagnoses, plumps and applies lip makeup. Using a specially formulated gel-like material (which is applied to the lips) that responds to light exposure, the three-in-one applicator senses and treats lip concerns by activating riboflavin, a natural vitamin, to \u201cstrengthen the collagen fibers in the lips\u201d to form a moisturizing barrier. No word yet on the release date, but beauty lovers will likely want to stay tuned on this kisser care and tinting device.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nPrince Harry Pulls Libel Claim Against British Tabloid Mail on Sunday\nEvents of the Week: \u2018Vanderpump Rules,\u2019 \u2018Law & Order: SVU\u2019 and More\nCritics Choice Red Carpet Winners Revealed: Margot Robbie\u2019s $2.5M Balmain Look, Charles Melton in Valentino\nRambling Reporter: Selena Gomez Can\u2019t Stop Quitting Instagram\nThe Gamble of Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Career (Exclusive Excerpt)\nCara Delevingne, South Korean Model Xu Meen Make a Case for Digital Nomad Style in MCM\u2019s New Campaign\nMost Popular\nMeghan Markle & Prince Harry Are Reportedly 'Shocked' Over the Controversy Surrounding Daughter Lilibet's Name\nThe Egyptian Government Bulldozed an Iconic Cairo Art Center With \u2018Millions\u2019 in Art Inside\nKobe-Inspired Mamba Foundation Amasses Cash but Spends Little\nMo'Nique Blames Oprah For Taraji P.
