AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design. He started producing vid...\n3 Comments\npulseimages\nWas hoping Nintendo would give more info on the upcoming Switch successor.\nbeowulfschmidt\nSeems more likely for them to hold their own event for that, especially now that E3 is history.\nlaytech\nAre those sponsored devices in that article as nothing interested me whatsoever.

While it\u2019s been two years in the making, we\u2019ve officially reached a generative nexus point, conceding to admit that ChatGPT has reshaped an entire industry \u2014 the automated future is now. Pretty much everyone from Big Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, to itty-bitty startups with big Kickstarter dreams hailed their usage of generative AI at this year\u2019s show \u2014 whether or not it deserved to fit into the products themselves, however, is another matter entirely.\nYes, it feels like nearly every new announcement was boasting a \u201csmarter\u201d future with the help of artificial intelligence, from AI binoculars for the savvy birder, to an adjustable electric toothbrush that feels like putting an entire computer in your mouth. It was overwhelming at times, given 2023\u2019s show focused mostly on minor improvements to existing flagship products as opposed to bold new swing-for-the-fences technologies.\nStill, we were still surprised and delighted by some key product innovations, AI-infused and otherwise. So we dug through the digital noise, watched press conferences, and even live-streamed product demos, and found 32 gadgets deserving of our Rolling Stone \u201cBest Of CES 2024\u201d Award.\nWe chose our CES 2024 award winners based on design, functionality and innovation, focusing on unique products that help solve everyday problems, upgrade our life, or push the limits of technology. Scroll through to see the companies and products that made our Best of CES 2024 list.\nLG Signature OLED T Transparent TV\nAfter a ho-hum year of TV releases from usual titans of the small screen Samsung and Sony, the buzziest model at CES year by far proves that, sure, you can always go bigger and brighter \u2014 but transparency has never looked cooler.\nLG\u2019s new Signature OLED T isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel \u2014 transparent OLED technology has been around for years commercially. But for the first time in 2024, LG is making the see-through TV a must-have part of your home entertainment setup. We actually saw their transparent OLED concept in-person at last year\u2019s show, and while it\u2019s not clear-as-glass, this living room-ready model combines the best parts of their M4 series with \u201ccool factor\u201d of being able to turn your TV into an eye-catching piece of home decor (the transparent fish tank demo we saw was certainly better than anything the Samsung Frame can do).\nSpeaking of the M4 series, the OLED T smartly supports LG\u2019s \u201cZero Connect\u201d wireless connectivity: an external box housing all the HDMI connections and media players you need with the ability to beam 4K 120Hz video straight to the screen from up to 30 feet away. Overall, LG\u2019s OLED T is firing on all cyllinders when it comes to attention to design detail, and that\u2019s the transparent truth. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on LG for\n$TBD\nHP Omen Transcend 14 Laptop\nGaming laptops tend to have a certain kind of intense look to reflect all the ultra-high-powered software packed within \u2014 big and bulky designs, flashy RGB keyboard lighting, etc. HP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 may not look the part, but this ultraportable has stealthily become one of the best gaming laptops around.\nIt packs a lot of power into a slim design, all thanks to the Meteor Lake chip, with a processor\u2019s NPU that can handle running a streaming application like OBS while the CPU and GPU focuses on the game you\u2019re currently playing. There\u2019s an option of 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and the display is a 14-inch OLED with a 2880 x 1800 resolution and up to a 120Hz refresh rate (as with most of the laptops announced during CES this year, it also\u00a0 supports Wi-Fi 7).\nIf you love to game, but still want your laptop to pull double duty at the office or for your personal needs, HP\u2019s new Omen Transcend 14 shows that big power can come in a sleek, lightweight package.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on HP for\n$1,499.99\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Earbuds\nSennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 are the latest impressively-engineered wireless earbuds from one of our favorite audio companies around.\nThe earbuds might look nearly identical to their predecessors, but they feature massive upgrades to ANC, powerful enough to cancel out noisy commutes and the hum of an airplane. Transparency mode is also more natural sounding than ever before, and Sennheiser also says the buds get a respectable seven and a half hours of battery life with noise-cancelling turned off.\nBut the highlight here is a new audio chipset which gives the buds improved sound, good bass, and a crisper quality (this is thanks to Qualcomm\u2019s S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless support). There were a lot of earbuds unveiled at CES this year, but the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4s impressive technology and improved features made them stand out.\u00a0Releases: February 15.\nBuy on Sennheiser\n$299\nRabbit R1 AI\nDescribed by Time as potentially the \u201ciPhone of AI\u201d, Rabbit R1 swept CES 2024 as\u00a0the definitive AI-powered companion that feels like having a personal assistant right in your pocket \u2014 and clearly 20,000 people agreed, selling out the first batch of units in a single day, and then the second batch by Thursday.\nThe R1 is so ambitious that you can\u2019t help but believe it might just replace your smartphone someday. But what does it do exactly? Powered by a \u201cLarge Action Model,\u201d this retro-looking device is more advanced than it looks, and in the simplest terms, it\u2019s a universal controller for your apps. Similar to asking your smart home device, \u201cHey Alexa, order more paper towels\u201d, you can use the Rabbit OS to control your music, purchase groceries, send text messages, and more, all through a single interface.\nStreamlining all your apps\u2019 functionalities into one, it eliminates the need to juggle logins and interfaces \u2014 just ask for what you want and the R1 delivers.\u00a0Available for Pre-orders Now.\nBuy on Rabbit for $199\nFiiO R9 Hi-fi Media Streamer\nThe FiiO R9 is a gorgeous, high-end, do-it-all media player that will turn your desktop into the ultimate hi-fi streaming station. Like its praise-worthy predecessor, the R7, this is a streaming DAC and headphone amplifier all in one, with a variety of wireless and wired connections for any way you want to play your tunes.\nWhat we like: the R9 has a much-improved Qualcomm Bluetooth chip, even better twin DACs (now ESS Labs 9030PRO), and an amplifier that\u2019s twice as powerful. Variety is key here, and depending on how beefed up your audio system is, it can drive to most speakers or headphones, or integrate into an existing hi-fi system (there\u2019s a new HDMI ARC port, too, in case you want to hook it up to a TV).\nIt\u2019s also easy on the eyes, with a 6-inch FHD display and delightfully tactile knobs that make interacting with the R9 a dream.\u00a0Just add speakers, and the FiiO R9 will be music to your ears.\nBuy on FiiO for $1,499\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nChina-based tech startup Xreal joined the wearable AR race this year, creating smart glasses fit to give the Apple Vision Pro some stiff competition. They\u2019re taking a huge step forward with the Air 2 Ultra glasses, which represent a future with AR that feels seamlessly integrated with everyday life.\nOne thing that impressed us was how Xreal\u2019s glasses are considerably smaller and more natural-looking than other bulky mixed-reality headsets. At roughly 0.2 pounds, they\u2019re lightweight enough to feel comfortable for extended wear, and support full motion tracking (6DoF, or six degrees of freedom), so it can tell whether you\u2019re moving around in a space.\nInteracting with the various screens and menus through the glasses is a breeze, and the Air 2 Ultras as surprisingly responsive to the \u201cpinching\u201d movement meant to navigate apps (similar to the \u201cDouble Tap\u201d on the new Apple Watch Series 9).\u00a0 When viewing 2D content, it\u2019s like looking at a 154-inch display from 13 feet away. Although the success of AR glasses like these will ultimately rely on the apps that are developed for them, for now, Xreal\u2019s Air 2 Ultra shows a promising future ahead for real-world applications of AR. Your move, Apple.\u00a0Releases: March 2024.\nBuy on Xreal for $699\nSamsung Music Frame\nWhile Samsung is going full force on the aesthetic \u201cFrameification\u201d of their most popular products, one aesthetically-pleasing addition to the household that we\u2019re looking forward to is their Music Frame, a Bluetooth speaker for those who don\u2019t want their audio setup to look like an AV Club\u2019s closet.\nWhile it shares a lot, design-wise, with the Sonos x Ikea Symfonisk frame speaker collaboration from last year, there\u2019s still a lot to love here. The physical print on the front will be customizable when orders go live, so it can seamlessly blend into any style you\u2019re going for in your home, whether you use it as a picture frame, or for a modern art display.\nLet\u2019s talk specs: the Music Frame contains two, built-in woofers, two tweeters, and two midrange drivers, with waveguides that will really help create a depth of sound, especially for wider rooms. It\u2019ll also provide surround sound when paired with 2024 Samsung TVs and soundbars, or you can just operate it as a standalone wireless speaker. Samsung\u2019s Music Frame proves you don\u2019t have to sacrifice style for substance, and we can\u2019t wait to hang it up and hit play at home.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Samsung for $TBD\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 is a 2-in-1 laptop that gives you the rare one-two punch of a laptop that can double as tablet,\u00a0and one that can run both Windows and Android. More is more here, and you\u2019re getting the display of an Android tablet with the keyboard base (hybrid station) of a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU.\nSmartly-engineered with a Qualcomm processor powering the tablet and the aformentioned Intel chip in the base, the two pieces can function independently when you need them to. When connected to an external monitor, the base can serve as a standalone Windows machine. Need a more portable option? Just snap off the 14-inch 2.8K OLED display from its base and use it as a tablet.\nBeing able to switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button is a game-changer, and the Lenovo is leading the way to full Windows-Android compatability with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5. Releases: Q4 2024.\nBuy on Lenovo for\n$1,999\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nIt\u2019s BBQ season year-round now with GE Profile\u2019s first-of-its-kind indoor smart smoker that\u2019ll let you inbue your own meats with festival-worthy flavor.\nNot only is this unique indoor smoker small enough to fit on your countertop, but it\u2019s safe to use inside, and won\u2019t fill your home smokey, alarm-triggering fumes. Break out your hickory and applewood chips, because the wood-pellet smoke is filtered through a tightly-sealed, advanced catalyst converter. With no filters to clean or replace, you\u2019ll get full-smoked flavor that\u2019ll infuse into your meats, fish,\u00a0 veggies, etc. and not your curtains or clothes.\nThere are five adjustable smoke levels, so you can tailor the\u00a0 smoke intensity to their preference. You can precisely control and monitor cooking through the smart app integrations, plus there are dozens of recipes available, too. A built-in probe also helps avoid overcooking or undercooking precious cuts of meats.\nWhile it\u2019s not necessary for every kitchen, wannable pitmasters will get a lot of mileage out of GE Profile\u2019s Smart Indoor Smoker.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on Amazon for $999.00\nMaster & Dynamic MW75 Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic has long been a go-to brand for audiophiles, but they\u2019re teaming with Neurable, an AI platform, to combine their premium sound with neurotechnology to help maximize your cognitive performance with the MW75 Neuro Headphones.\nThe Bluetooth headphones feature Neurable\u2019s unique neural sensors, meant to measure brain signals to help the wearer focus, destress, and improve their mental health (according to the brand, this is the first product outside the medical industry to use this kind of technology). Ideally, you\u2019ll be able to use the headphones in combination with the Neurable app to tack how activities impact your focus and get informed recommendations on how to optimize your day.\nMaster & Dynamic didn\u2019t skimp on the audio features, though. The MW75 Neuros get up to 32 hours of music playback when noise-cancelling is disabled (eight hours when ANC and EEG are enabled), and eight microphones filter out external noise for clear calls and noise cancellation.

You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Best of CES 2024: From 4K Projectors to Neural Headphones, Here Is the Best Tech to Look Forward to This Year\nThe Consumer Electronics Show features thousands upon thousands of tech products and we narrowed it down to the best.\nBy\nRudie Obias\nRudie Obias\neditor\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\nEvery year, the best and brightest companies in tech come to Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show \u2014\u00a0otherwise known as CES \u2014\u00a0to announce and showcase new entertainment, audio & video, wellness, household and transportation products for the year ahead.\nOver five days at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels and casinos, we visited booths, press conferences, presentations and participated in countless tech demos to find the best of the best of CES. These brands and products were chosen based on usefulness, function, innovation and overall cool factor.\nWe narrowed down the winners in a number of categories from laptops to robot vacuums and smart home devices to 4K TVs. We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar. The LG Soundbar S95TR is a 9.1.5-channel sound system that comes with 65-inch soundbar with three up-firing speakers, rear speakers and a subwoofer for your TV, while the system is Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and DTS:X compatible for immersive and detailed audio. It also connects wirelessly to just about any LG 4K TVs via WOWcast.\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nIf you\u2019re alone, but needed a portable solution to dynamic Zoom video calls or just making a TikTok video, the Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit is a very cool and useful way to make self-tracking videos with your Apple iPhone.It\u2019s MagSafe and NFC (Near Field Communication), so all you have to do is attach your iPhone and Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro will track and follow your body and face. During our time with the product, it appeared to move smoothly and effortlessly with 360-degree rotation and 90-degree tilt. wMeanwhile, it has up to five hours of use per charge and works in-app with TikTok, Zoom, Instagram and more.Belkin has it priced at $179.99, while the tech company has yet to announce availability.\nMaster & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic partnered with a neuroscience company called Neurable to deliver a pair of wireless headphones that can your track work sessions and measure your stress levels through your brain waves through a mobile app. They can even recommend when you should take a break when you\u2019re deep into your work.Aside from their focus capabilities, Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones offer premium audio quality with active noise cancellation and up to 32 hours of battery life per charge. The headphones are available for pre-order for $649 with delivery in early 2024.\nJBL Live 3 Earbuds\nNot only do the JBL Live 3 Earbuds feature world-class audio that crisp, clear and rich with active noise-cancellation, they offer something that most premium wireless earbuds do not \u2014\u00a0a charging case with a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen display. Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line. It has an AMOLED touchscreen display that comes in three case sizes (42mm, 47mm and 51mm), while the watch comes with an LED flashlight, a heart rate monitor, blood oxygen monitor, step and calorie counter and a built-in GPS with up to a whopping 16 days of battery life per charge.In our brief testing period, the Garmin Epix Pro appeared to be durable and solid since it\u2019s made with premium materials, such as stainless steel, a fiber-reinforced polymer, a steel rear cover and Corning Gorilla Glass. It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels. It has a 1000R curvature, 7680 x 2160 4K resolution with up to 120Hz for smooth motion and action when gaming, while it has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits. The monitor has dual 10-watt speakers for audio, as well as AMD\u2019s FreeSync Premium to reduce screen tearing or distortion. It\u2019s ideal for PC consoles, Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5.Acer will have it ready for retail sometime during the first half of 2024 with pricing starting at $2,499.99.\nRoboRock S8 MaxV Ultra\nThe new Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is a hybrid cleaner that vacuums up dirt, dust and grime from carpets, rugs, and hardwood floors with powerful 10,000Pa of suction pressure, while it also mops tiles in kitchens and bathrooms with dual sonic vibration scrubbers.The smart home robovac has a versatile charging dock that\u2019s self-emptying with up to a seven-week capacity of debris storage, self-filling water tank for mopping, and self-cleaning reservoir for maintenance on itself. The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is perfect for larger rooms and homes.Roborock has it priced starting at $1,800 with an expected release date sometime in spring 2024.\nXgimi Horizon Max Projector\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is an IMAX Enhanced-certified projector, which means it fits the criteria for the resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio from IMAX at home. This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. It has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode, so you can have different settings for different walls in your home. So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action. The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

The study aimed to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of the Tuned self-test in obtaining hearing thresholds across multiple frequencies.\nIn the study, 30 participants with hearing impairment took part in a controlled environment, specifically a sound proof booth. Hearing thresholds at frequencies of 500, 1000, 2000, and 4000 Hz were measured using both traditional audiometry and the Tuned self-test. For traditional audiometry, an experienced audiologist conducted the test following standard clinical procedures. In the self-test condition, participants were equipped with a cellphone containing the Tuned app and a pair of Tuned Lumen hearing aids, enabling them to conduct the self-test with guidance from the application.\nThe remarkable findings showcased that the difference between the Tuned self-test and traditional audiometry was less than 5 dB across all tested frequencies. This level of variation falls well within the range of test-retest reliability observed in clinical settings. These results demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the Tuned self-test in assessing hearing thresholds, providing a viable alternative to traditional audiometry.\nThe implications of this study are profound. The Tuned self-test opens up new possibilities for individuals to conveniently monitor their hearing health in the comfort of their own homes, reducing the need for frequent clinical visits. This technology empowers individuals with hearing impairment to take an active role in their hearing care and make informed decisions based on reliable self-assessment.\nWe at Tuned are committed to driving innovation and improving the accessibility of hearing health solutions.\nThe success of the Tuned self-test in this study further solidifies our dedication to revolutionizing the field of audiology and empowering individuals with advanced technology.\nStay tuned for more updates as we continue to develop cutting-edge solutions that enhance the lives of individuals with hearing impairment.\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n211 followers\nExplore topics"

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nCES 2024 is in full swing, and more innovative product reveals were made on day 2 of the biggest tech show of the year. And since it's the biggest show, we know not everyone is going to catch the hundreds of announcements across the more than 4,000 exhibitors.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nZDNET has cut through all the noise to bring you the most important and biggest announcements and products of day 2 that you may have missed. We were even able to go hands-on with some of these products below.\nStay tuned for even more product and big tech announcements tomorrow for CES day 3.\n1. New features coming to Android devices\nAndroid users will appreciate the several exciting announcements that Google made at CES Day 2. The most important feature coming to Android devices next month is a cross-Android solution called Quick Share. Quick Share will offer peer-to-peer content sharing across all types of Android-based devices, such as phones and even Chromebooks.\nAlso: CES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nOther new features and updates include Fast Pair support expansion, more casting capabilities to more apps and devices (including TikTok), and Android Auto integration into more vehicles like the new \u00a0Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning.\n2. Nanoleaf's impressive smart lighting\nSmart lighting company, Nanoleaf, announced some exciting additions to its smart lighting lineup, including a new Orchestrator software for music integrations. The software connects directly to a computer's sound source and isolates the response to the device, resulting in the lights reacting to an audio track's precise different layers.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight was also revealed, which the company says is a set of square light panels that are meant to be installed on the ceiling and capable of emitting 1400 lumens per square. Other product announcements included multicolor outdoor string lights with Matter support.\n3. EcoFlow's whole-house portable power station\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra generator has been recognized as a 2024 CES Innovation Awards Honoree thanks to its impressive specs. These include a power capacity of 6kWh (an entire home), and capable of 7200W output and 5.6kW of solar input. The system is also compatible with expansion packs, increasing the power capacity to a whopping 90kWh which can run power to your home's essential appliances for up to an entire month.\nAlso: The best CES 2024 gadgets you can buy right now\nZDNET writer Maria Diaz got to try this powerful generator at her own home and called it the \"Swiss Army Knife of home backup systems,\" adding that it's also \"a whisper-quiet solution, one that you can't even hear when under 2000W.\"\n4. Android's answer to Apple Watch's double-tap feature\nThe Wow Mouse app was built for Android smartwatches to act as an extension to the smartwatch, letting you control tech around you via Bluetooth with just a gesture of your hands. It's kind of similar to Apple's Double-Tap feature on the Apple Watch, but instead of controlling things on the watch itself, Wow Mouse takes it up a notch and allows users to turn their smart lights on or off or lower the volume of a speaker.\n5. A battery that charges your phone in mere seconds\nCES is all about using tech to provide solutions, and this external smartphone battery from Swappery solves the problem of a dead battery in just seven seconds. Here's how it works: When your phone runs out of juice, place it in the Swapery station, wait seven seconds, then remove it to get a new battery attachment that will last you approximately 8-10 hours, the company says.\nAlso: The best mobile accessories at CES 2024: Qi2 chargers, face-tracking phone stands, and more\nThough it isn't your most conventional charger, it could give you a fully charged battery without needing any other cables, adapters, or plug-ins.\n6. Lenovo's hybrid laptop\nLenovo announced the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid at CES day 2, and it's impressive for two reasons. First, it's a 2-in-1 device that can be a laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, or a touchscreen tablet with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ processor. Second, it switches between Windows and Android seamlessly, depending on what \"mode\" (tablet or laptop) you choose.\nAlso: Lenovo made a Mac Studio for Windows users, and it might even be better\nEach component of this hybrid device even has its own battery. It'll cost you $1,999, but you really get a seperate tablet and a laptop all in one for the price.\n7. An AI gadget that interacts with apps so you don't have to\nRabbit is going back to the basics at CES 2024 with its Rabbit R1 device that wants to essentially replace the need for your smartphone when it comes to using apps. The little gadget fits into your palm and uses AI to see and learn how a user interacts with their typical smartphone apps and web experiences and then reproduce it (when verbally asked) on a customized cloud platform.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nThe basis is really for those who may want to solve their smartphone addiction since it scrolls your apps for you. Rabbit says some of the popular apps you can task R1 with include Spotify, Apple Music, DoorDash, Uber, Amazon, and more.\n8. Amazon introduces Matter Casting\nAmazon is taking a page out of Apple and Google's casting playbook and introduced a new way to cast videos from your phones and tablets directly on supported Amazon devices. Called Matter Casting, you can now cast Prime Video content to the Echo Show 15. Support for Fire TV devices, including TVs with Fire TV built in, will roll out in the next few months, and Amazon added that it hopes to add Matter Casting capabilities to services like Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, STARZ, and more within the year.\nUnlike Apple AirPlay and Google Chromecast, Amazon's Matter Casting uses the Matter Protocol of the open technology standard so that smart home tech from different brands can all work together more seamlessly.\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 3: The 6 announcements you may have missed\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES Day 4: ZDNET's top 10 CES stories you don't want to miss"

Why Trust Us?\nThe 2024 edition of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) \u2014 one of the biggest annual consumer tech industry events \u2014 wraps today. Virtually countless new products debuted at the show over the past four days, and they ranged from computers and TVs to various home appliances and small gadget accessories. CES has always been a venue for brands to display concepts and ultra-premium offerings. (Take, this year, the stunning and transparent LG Signature OLED T TV.) But among the outstanding design and engineering, the most noteworthy trend this year was AI making its way into more and more of our tech.\nThe products at this year\u2019s trade show proved that in the years ahead, artificial intelligence will do a lot more than just help with productivity. AI will also enable a TV to deliver pristine picture quality, tune a speaker for optimal sound, and even make sure a meal is perfectly cooked, to name just a few tasks. AI-powered tech in everyday appliances looks bound to become a norm in the years ahead as well, if you\u2019re looking to give someone or yourself the gift of an extra pair of (virtual) hands around the house.\nAs we do every year, we spent days tuning in to product briefings and combing through press releases and spec sheets to handpick the best new gadgets that debuted at CES 2024. We focused on products that will actually go on sale and have the potential to make their way into consumers\u2019 daily routines in the weeks and months ahead. (There can be a lot of vaporware at the show, after all.)\nWe broke down the most exciting products that captured our attention into the following major categories: Entertainment & Audio, Computers & Accessories, Mobile Gadgets, Home & Appliances, and Family. Since most of these products are not available for purchase just yet, be sure to come back in the months ahead to learn more about these gadgets once we\u2019ve had hands-on experience with them.\nEntertainment & Audio\nThe TCL QM8 was our favorite TV of 2023, and its 2024 sequel is even more exciting. The latest iteration of the 4K TV brings a quantum dot mini LED panel with more local dimming zones for superior contrast and a peak brightness of a whopping 5,000 nits. That translates to double the brightness of the 2023 model, ensuring the 2024 TCL QM8 will deliver striking visuals even in brightly lit spaces.\nThe 4K TV will become available to order in the months ahead. We don\u2019t know the pricing details yet, but given TCL\u2019s track record, we expect it will be super reasonable. The tech giant also unveiled a TV with a stunning 115-inch mini LED screen \u2014 the largest of its kind.\n\u2014 Stefan Vazharov, Senior Technology Editor, Reviews\nIn addition to delivering a sleek design, comfy fit, and the iconic brand's signature sound and top-tier noise cancellation, the Momentum Sport true wireless earbuds by Sennheiser pack heart rate and temperature sensors for next-level activity and wellness tracking. The sensors' readings can integrate with the user's preferred health- and fitness-tracking platforms like Apple Health, Garmin Connect, Strava, and Peloton, to name a few.\nThe sweat- and water-resistant earbuds will become available to order in April for $329.99. There will be three colors to choose from: burned olive, polar black, and metallic graphite.\n\u2014 SV\nJBL\u2019s Live 670NC and Live 770NC wireless headphones are our favorite to arrive at CES 2024. Like their excellent predecessors, the newcomers deliver a mixture of elegant design, high-quality sound with spatial audio capabilities, reliable noise cancellation, and superb battery life, all at an agreeable price. The Live 670NC cans have an on-ear fit, while the 770NC has a traditional over-ear layout.\nThe latest JBL headphones will hit the shelves in March. The Live 770NC and Live 670NC will cost $199.95 and $129.95, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Samsung Music Frame, like the legendary TV with the same, is a tech product that can effortlessly blend into any home decor via customizable covers. Equipped with Samsung Q-Symphony tech, the speaker will sync perfectly with its maker\u2019s TVs and soundbars for an immersive surround sound experience.\nDetails about the pricing and retail availability of the Samsung Music Frame have yet to be made available, but we don't expect the wait to be too long.\n\u2014 SV\nThe JBL Xtreme 4 is a sequel to one of our favorite waterproof Bluetooth speakers and an instant best-in-class contender. The gadget is capable of blasting AI-enhanced sound that\u2019s customizable via an app and up to 30 hours of audio playback between power-ups. Its replaceable battery pack sets it apart from all rivals.\nWe like that JBL manufactured the speaker using 70% recycled plastic and 100% reclaimed fabric. The Xtreme 4 will hit the shelves this June in several colors with a $379.95 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nThe EarFun Wave Pro wireless headphones are the audio maker's first and a rock-solid contender for the best budget set in the game. Like the brand's stellar wireless earbuds, the over-ear cans offer an appealing combination of sleek design, customizable sound with support for Hi-Res Audio, and strong noise cancellation. To top things off, the headphones can rather impressively deliver 80 hours of wireless playback between charges.\nSales of the EarFun Wave Pro headphones will begin this spring. The headphones will cost $79.99 \u2014 an incredible design given their design, specs, and onboard features.\n\u2014 SV\nComputers & Accessories\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo is an exciting new addition to the PC laptop realm not only for its striking dual-screen design but also for its affordable price. The notebook will start below $1,500 when it becomes available to order this spring. Combined with its versatile design and high-end specs, the price makes a serious case for choosing the new ZenBook Duo over a premium touchscreen laptop with a conventional form factor.\nHardware-wise, the ZenBook Duo features a pair of high-resolution OLED touchscreens with a high refresh rate and a cutting-edge Intel Core chip with Arc graphics. Of course, the product will be bundled with a Bluetooth keyboard with an integrated trackpad.\n\u2014 SV\nHP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 gaming laptop impressed us by delivering top-tier hardware specs \u2014 an Intel Core Ultra chip, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics, a high-performance OLED display panel, and a rich set of connectivity features \u2014 in a compact and elegant package that weighs just a feather above 3.5 pounds. That\u2019s on par with the weight of a 14-inch MacBook Pro, making the Omen Transcend 14 incredibly lightweight and portable for a high-performance PC gaming rig.\nThe versatile Omen Transcend 14 is already available to pre-order from HP with a $1,500 starting price. That\u2019s quite a bargain, especially considering its striking design and futureproof specs.\n\u2014 SV\nThe detachable keyboard on Lenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid made it our favorite Android tablet of CES 2024. Because it features a full-blown PC with an Intel chip and Windows 11 on board, it gives you two devices (a laptop and a tablet) wrapped into one \u2014 not just a feature-rich tablet with a bundled keyboard.\nRemarkably, the two components can work together or separately, depending on your needs. The product will hit the shelves in the spring with a hefty $1,999 price tag.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 4K gaming monitor by Samsung deserves your attention for being great at, well, everything \u2014 from high-performance gameplay to delivering your favorite streaming content with incredible picture quality via the tech giant\u2019s smart platform. Combined with a minimalist design, the product\u2019s 32-inch display panel with millions of individually backlit pixels and antireflective finish makes it a great upgrade option for work and play.\nSamsung also equipped the monitor with a SmartThings Hub for controlling connected home gadgets. An ultra-wide Odyssey OLED G9 monitor with a curved 49-inch screen debuted as well for those who need to replace two screens.\n\u2014 SV\nNVIDIA launched the GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs during CES. The latest-generation graphics cards pack dedicated cores for AI processing, ensuring the cutting-edge tech will take the users\u2019 experience \u2014 from heavy workloads to in-game visuals \u2014 to a whole new level. The latest components deliver a significant performance bump over their top-shelf GeForce RTX 30 series predecessors.\nPricing of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs will start at a reasonable $599 for an RTX 4070 Super version. The range-topping RTX 4080 SUPER, dubbed a \u201c4K monster\u201d by its maker, will cost $999.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Razer Aetner monitor light bar is a handy desktop accessory that will give your work and gaming sessions a bright, colorful upgrade. The attachable dual light consists of an adjustable white strip and a back-facing row of color LEDs that are customizable via the excellent Razer Chroma RGB suite. The white light will illuminate your workspace, while the colorful backlight is a must for gaming.\nWe like that the Razer Aetner is compatible with the Matter smart home standard and that its LED lights have a lifetime of 25,000 hours.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Clutch Tanto Mini Xbox controller by HyperX \u2014 the maker of our favorite budget gamepad \u2014 stands out with an incredibly compact design. Its compact footprint is tailor-made for younger gamers. I tip my hat to HyperX for creating the product, as I still remember how unwieldy the three-button Sega Genesis controller was back in the early 1990s.\nThe tiny gamepad has a standard Xbox layout and a built-in audio jack. It will launch this spring with an attractive $39.99 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nDo you have a teenage gamer that's very amenable to bribery? RCA\u2019s new gaming monitor might just do the trick to get them to agree to study. My son, the gamer of our house, watched the press release and was blown away by the \u201cdamn fast\u201d 240Hz refresh rate, the 2-millisecond input lag, 1 millisecond GtG response time, cool swiveling features, USB-C 90W charging and DisplayPort Alt-Mode, and \u201csick backlighting.\u201d\nThe whole thing is on a pivot stand and seamlessly switches between PS5, computer, Xbox, or any other platform you choose to use it for. Personally, I\u2019m hoping some English homework makes it on the monitor between bouts of GTA. RCA is new to gaming monitors, but being the grandad of the electronics industry gives them a great leg-up, and we\u2019re excited to see more innovations like this from the brand in the future.\n\u2014 Cat Bowen, Senior Editor, Reviews\nMobile Gadgets\nOtterBox launched a lineup of elegant and sustainable iPhone cases made from sustainable cactus-based leather. Dubbed Desserto, the leather-like material is stylish, great to interact with, and, crucially, eco-friendly. The accessory giant also unveiled a MagSafe wallet and an Apple Watch band from the same material.\nThe MagSafe-compatible case will become available in several colors this spring for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro family. It will cost $59.99, while the MagSafe wallet and the Apple Watch band will go for $49.99 and $39.99, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nZagg launched a version of the iconic mophie juice pack battery case for the latest iPhones during CES 2024. A synonym for iPhone backup power for well over a decade, the nifty gadget will significantly extend the charging independence of the Apple smartphone while keeping it pocket-friendly. It will be available for iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nYou'll be able to pre-order the mophie juice pack in late February for $99.99, which will come with a robust two-year warranty.\n\u2014 SV\nBelkin's Stand Pro is not just yet another sleek MagSafe iPhone stand from the well-known accessory maker. Thanks to support for Apple's DockKit standard, the motorized accessory offers 360-degree movement tracking. This means that whether users are on a video call or capturing content for social media, they will always be perfectly framed.\nThe accessory has a button for enabling and disabling tracking. Of course, it also doubles as a fast MagSafe charger. You will be able to snag one in the months ahead for $179.99.\n\u2014 SV\nHome & Appliances\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight is a noteworthy, low-key addition to the maker\u2019s excellent lineup of lighting fixtures that were showcased at CES 2024. In a manner befitting its name, the smart home product consists of light panels that are flush-mountable on a ceiling. It\u2019s easily expandable and adaptable to any space and usage scenario.\nLike all Nanoleaf products, the Skylight can glow with millions of customizable colors and shades of white. It\u2019s controllable via an app or through voice commands from your preferred virtual assistant.\n\u2014 SV\nLG\u2019s latest Styler is a home appliance that will make the chore of storing and maintaining your favorite clothes in perfect condition a breeze. Thanks to a high-tech Moving Hanger system and an available Fine Dust cycle, the Styler will remove dust particles. What\u2019s more, the product\u2019s integrated high-pressure steamer can remove wrinkles and sanitize clothes.\nOther key Styler features include a room dehumidification functionality and a ventilation system. Pricing and availability details are yet to be revealed.\n\u2014 SV\nThe eufy X10 Pro Omni robot vacuum impressed us by offering a ton of desirable features at a price point that\u2019s well below $1,000. The versatile cleaning robot can vacuum and mop floors with the help of its sophisticated navigation setup feature. Better yet, it can empty its bin, refill its water container, and even clean and dry its mopping pads by docking into its Omni station.\nAnker will begin offering the eufy X10Pro Omni in February for $799.99. That\u2019s considerably less than big-name rivals with comparable features.\n\u2014 SV\nThis Wi-Fi-equipped smart deadbolt by Philips will replace your keys or smartphone with your palm. The convenient gadget has a sophisticated palm reader, which will unlock it by scanning your hand\u2019s vein patterns. The latter are unique for everyone, guaranteeing that only authorized users can unlock it.\nUnsurprisingly, the Philips deadbolt is also compatible with virtual assistant voice commands, allowing you to control it or keep tabs on its status. The product will be available to buy in the coming months for $359.99.\n\u2014 SV\nFamily\nWith the BeamO multiscope, Withings treated us to the best health and wellness gadget of CES 2024. The device sets a new standard for wellness monitoring by merging a contactless thermometer, a digital stethoscope, an ECG, and an oximeter in a sleek package that\u2019s easy to use at home or anywhere else.\nGetting the readings will take about a minute, and users will be able to share the results with their doctor via a sleek companion app. The BeamO will become available to order this summer for $249.95.\n\u2014 SV\nMasimo\u2019s monitoring technology is used in over 10 million babies annually in hosptials worldwide, and now they\u2019re bringing their powerful tech to parents with an FDA-approved-for-prescription wearable baby monitor. Utilizing a sock/boot style device, it monitors your baby\u2019s pulse, skin temperature if your baby has rolled over, alerting parents if anything is outside normal limits. It can be used when your baby is asleep and awake for continuous monitoring if your baby requires that.The Stork Baby Wearable Monitor can also share your baby\u2019s data with their health providers. For parents of medically fragile children, this little device could help bring a lot of peace, and because it\u2019s by-prescription, insurance may cover it, though insurance plans are not yet in place.\nThe non-prescription version is sold at major retailers, and it also includes a high-resolution video camera along with all of the monitoring available in the prescription monitor, without the immediate alerts.\u2014 CB\nMaxi Cosi is one of our favorite baby brands at Best Products. They\u2019re known for their high-quality, innovative, affordable baby products, and as of CES 2024, they've entered into the electronics space. With the See Pro 360\u00ba Baby Monitor, they\u2019re taking their affordable and innovative reputation and applying it to a very pricey realm.The See Pro 360\u00ba is a combination of a handheld monitor and camera and a smartphone monitor, giving parents choices of how to view their baby. Like last year\u2019s debut, the Q-Bear, this monitor uses CryAssist technology not only to detect when your baby\u2019s crying but also to translate the sounds to determine if your baby is sleepy, hungry, wet, or just plain cranky.\nIt has everything you\u2019d expect in a modern monitor: two-way talking, temperature and humidity sensors, a high-definition camera with clear color, night vision, and a long battery life on the monitor itself. It\u2019s doing this all for just $199.\u2014 CB\nThe Owlet is not new to the wearable baby monitor game, but they\u2019ve recently stepped up their game, and they\u2019re showing it off at CES. Like Masimo, they\u2019re offering an FDA-cleared-for-prescription wearable baby monitor for parents of babies with a need for clinical monitoring outside of the clinical setting. The Owlet offers something unique from Masimo in that your child\u2019s pediatrician can set the parameters for the alerts sent to them and the parents.\nThe BabySat measures oxygen levels, heart rate, and levels of motion. Stats are easily viewable through Owlet\u2019s straightforward app. Like their original sock, it\u2019s a wireless monitoring device designed to stay put on your baby\u2019s foot all night (and day) long.\u2014 CB\nTikiSmart just finished a wildly successful crowd-funding campaign, and now they\u2019re showcasing their kid-safety system at CES. TikiSmart is a first-of-its-kind whole-home child monitoring device. It\u2019s a wearable device that tracks when your child gets near something dangerous, like if they\u2019re submerged in water or if they fall suddenly.The system includes a receiver, bracelets, and monitoring tags. You use the tags to determine danger areas, and if your child approaches it while wearing the monitoring bracelet, it alerts your phone and speaks the alert aloud over the receiver.\nYou can also buy a \u201crepeater\u201d that extends the coverage much in the same way a wifi extender extends your wifi coverage. The TikiSmart is bound to get a lot of buzz, likely both negative and positive, but for parents with family pools, a pond, or even a fire pit, the allure will likely be hard to resist.\u2014 CB\nThe Toniebox is one of the best storytelling devices, in our opinion, and they\u2019re coming out with some fantastic new characters that they\u2019re debuting at CES.Sara Llama is the Yoga Tonie, and she\u2019ll guide your child through four stories, each with a theme central to yoga, like friendship and confidence. There\u2019s Juniper, the potty training Tonie that uses stories to help your child prepare for potty training. And finally, there\u2019s Mo, the mindfulness Tonie that walks your child through mindful activities through his stories.\u2014 CB\nStefan is the senior technology editor for Best Products, where he\u2019s been covering the tech industry and testing the latest gadgets since 2015.
