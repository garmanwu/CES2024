Mass production late-2024.\nAn industry-first, Cypress achieves >140dB low frequency sound pressure level (SPL), enabling a no-compromise replacement for legacy, century-old coil speakers in noise canceling earbuds.\nSanta Clara, California, November 14, 2023 \u2013 xMEMS Labs, pioneers in solid-state, all-silicon micro speakers, today announced a revolutionary breakthrough in sound reproduction, changing the way mass-market, true wireless stereo (TWS) earbuds create ultra high-quality, high-resolution sound experiences across all audio frequencies.\nWith the introduction of its groundbreaking new Cypress solid-state MEMS speaker, xMEMS engineers have replaced legacy push-air sound reproduction with the company\u2019s ultrasonic amplitude modulation transduction principle. Ultrasonic modulation turns ultrasonic air pulses into rich, detailed, bass-heavy, high-fidelity sound, representing the first no-compromise alternative to the moving-coil concept for high-volume consumer active noise canceling (ANC) earbud micro speakers.\n\u201cBy shifting to a sound from ultrasound principle, the xMEMS Cypress micro speaker can now officially replace traditional coil-and-magnet speakers in active noise canceling earbuds,\u201d said Mike Housholder, Vice President, Marketing & Business Development for xMEMS. \u201cCypress maintains all of the benefits of xMEMS\u2019 existing speakers, while being 40x louder in low frequencies, achieving a key requirement for ANC earbuds.\u201d\nHow Cypress Creates the World\u2019s Best Audio Experience\nLegacy coil speakers generate sound in the audible band, which is intrinsically inefficient. Cypress takes advantage of the characteristics unique to MEMS\u2014speed, precision, and uniformity\u2014to produce high-resolution audio more efficiently.\nSound from ultrasound has been a research topic since the 1960s but has never achieved the acoustic performance required for broad commercial appeal, until xMEMS\u2019 Cypress.\nAs an air pulse generator, Cypress comprises: a modulator to generate an amplitude-modulated ultrasonic wave (carrier) that faithfully follows the amplitude of the intended audio signal; and a demodulator to synchronously demodulate the ultrasonic wave, transferring the acoustic energy down to the baseband, producing the intended audible sound as a result.\nThe sound envelope of ultrasonic pulses is an exact acoustic copy of the source signal, meaning across all frequencies, Cypress is more faithful to the original recording than current speaker technologies. As a result of its superior resolution in the time domain, Cypress can more accurately reproduce today\u2019s advanced sound formats, including high-resolution and spatial audio.\n\u201cCypress not only revolutionizes how sound can be reproduced from an electric signal, but it also redefines how it should be reproduced,\u201d said Jemm Liang, xMEMS CTO.\nBased on Proven Innovation on MEMS Design\nCypress leverages the same production-proven MEMS platform used for all existing xMEMS products and exploits all the benefits of xMEMS\u2019 established solid-state speaker designs when compared to legacy coil architectures, including:\nNow Cypress, in a 6.3 x 6.5 x 1.65mm package (9mm-diagonal), brings the added and significant benefit of being 40x louder in low frequencies compared to xMEMS\u2019 prior generation speakers, providing stronger, deeper bass that is consistent with the best 10-12mm legacy coil speakers, including sound pressure levels (SPL) greater than 140dB as low as 20Hz*.\nMEMS and Ultrasonic Modulation Ideal for ANC Performance\nThis additional low frequency SPL is most critical for ANC earbuds. With Cypress, xMEMS brings unique advantages over legacy coil to further improve ANC applications. Cypress\u2019 faster electrical-to-acoustic conversion can contribute to wider ANC bandwidth (i.e., extension of ANC to cancel higher frequency noise sources, like a crying baby). Plus, Cypress\u2019 near-constant electrical-to-acoustic conversion time (group delay), can reduce DSP filter complexity which, in turn, leads to shorter DSP latency, rounding errors, and power consumption when processing ANC.\nAvailability\nFull-function Cypress prototype silicon is now sampling to select early customers.

        "raw_content": "Next-gen MEMS ultrasonic solid-state earbud drivers will deliver the bass\nWe've heard the difference at CES 2024.\nWhile MEMS drivers may be the next big thing in true wireless earbuds, the first models with the solid-state components still require a hybrid setup. These products pair a MEMS speaker with a dynamic driver to ensure proper bass performance. The current-gen driver from xMEMS, a California-based company that develops the audio components, is called Cowell and it's already available in earbuds from the likes of Creative and Noble Audio.\nThe next-gen MEMS driver is called Cypress, and while it won't arrive in new products until 2025, I got a chance to hear the difference been it and Cowell at CES 2024 here in Las Vegas \u2014 and it's quite striking. With Cowell, there's bass, but it's subdued and the emphasis is on the highs and the mids. It sounds great, on both complete products and reference designs, offering punchy highs, full mids and great clarity. With Cypress alone though, there's a blanket of warm, bassy low-end that really fills out the soundstage. It will be a massive improvement for what MEMS drivers are capable of doing for wireless earbuds.\n\"We moved to a sound from ultrasound principle where we have ultrasonic modulation and demodulation to deliver 30 to 40 times greater low-frequency pressure for anti-noise generation for ANC earbuds, while still delivering all of the benefits of our solid state speakers,\" xMEMS vice president of marketing Mike Housholder explained. \"Wide dynamic range, with excellent low-frequency performance for deep bass and noise cancellation.\"\nIndeed, that 30 to 40 times louder bass response was clearly evident when on a Cypress reference design. The prototype was built to showcase the MEMS drivers on their own, without that secondary dynamic driver today's true wireless models require for bass. The results are the pristine clarity you'd expect in a send of high-end wireless headphones or even some audiophile-grade cans. The additional bass isn't loud and boomy, but instead it's warm and full, inviting you to stay and listen a while. And that I did: I had a hard time putting the Cypress prototype down even when I felt I'd overstayed my welcome.\nOn the whole, MEMS drivers offer a host of benefits over coil speakers that should all lead to better audio quality in your earbuds. They're more efficient in terms of mechanical response, with faster speeds there contributing to increased detail and clarity \u2014 something I certainly noticed on the Noble Audio FoKus Triumph wireless earbuds. This model pairs Cowell with a 6.5mm dynamic driver, but the boost in fidelity in the mids and highs is apparent. And getting a set of earbuds with MEMS drivers doesn't mean you'll pay more. The two models Creative has already debuted are $130 and $150. The same will be true for upcoming products with the ultrasonic Cypress drivers, according to Housholder.\n\"We see ourselves going to market first in flagship products,\" he said. \"As with our current products, we really see the sweet spot for our products anywhere 150 and up, [which] is easily achievable day one. And then over time and over volume, getting down to that $100 price point.\"\nAnd that's really the big takeaway from me. For years, companies have offered true wireless earbuds with some of the features of more premium flagship models, but usually lacking the sonic performance of pricier options. With MEMS drivers, the audio quality is greatly improved in affordable models that are half the price of the top-of-the-line Sony or Sennheiser noise-canceling earbuds. And with Cypress, xMEMS can offer audio companies the ability to improve overall sound quality without having to raise prices.\nxMEMS has also developed what it calls a DynamicVent to relieve occlusion in sleep earbuds. The component can automatically open or close depending on if the buds detect ambient noise like a snoring spouse. When open, the DynamicVent offers a semi-open fit like AirPods, but when it's closed the ear will be completely sealed off. The open vent should also keep sounds of your own breathing or the earbuds rubbing against a pillow from disturbing your sleep. xMEMS is showing off the DynamicVent at CES in a set of reference sleep buds equipped with its Cowell MEMS drivers.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

Ultrasonic modulation turns ultrasonic air pulses into rich, detailed, bass-heavy, high-fidelity sound, representing the first no-compromise alternative to the moving-coil concept for high-volume consumer active noise canceling (ANC) earbud micro speakers.\n\u201cBy shifting to a sound from ultrasound principle, the xMEMS Cypress micro speaker can now officially replace traditional coil-and-magnet speakers in active noise canceling earbuds,\u201d said Mike Housholder, Vice President, Marketing & Business Development for xMEMS. \u201cCypress maintains all of the benefits of xMEMS\u2019 existing speakers, while being 40x louder in low frequencies, achieving a key requirement for ANC earbuds.\u201d\nHow Cypress Creates the World\u2019s Best Audio Experience\nLegacy coil speakers generate sound in the audible band, which is intrinsically inefficient. Cypress takes advantage of the characteristics unique to MEMS\u2014speed, precision, and uniformity\u2014to produce high-resolution audio more efficiently.\nSound from ultrasound has been a research topic since the 1960s but has never achieved the acoustic performance required for broad commercial appeal, until xMEMS\u2019 Cypress.\nAs an air pulse generator, Cypress comprises: a modulator to generate an amplitude-modulated ultrasonic wave (carrier) that faithfully follows the amplitude of the intended audio signal; and a demodulator to synchronously demodulate the ultrasonic wave, transferring the acoustic energy down to the baseband, producing the intended audible sound as a result.\nThe sound envelope of ultrasonic pulses is an exact acoustic copy of the source signal, meaning across all frequencies, Cypress is more faithful to the original recording than current speaker technologies. As a result of its superior resolution in the time domain, Cypress can more accurately reproduce today\u2019s advanced sound formats, including high-resolution and spatial audio.\n\u201cCypress not only revolutionizes how sound can be reproduced from an electric signal, but it also redefines how it should be reproduced,\u201d said Jemm Liang, xMEMS CTO.\nBased on Proven Innovation in MEMS Design\nCypress leverages the same production-proven MEMS platform used for all existing xMEMS products and exploits all the benefits of xMEMS\u2019 established solid-state speaker designs when compared to legacy coil architectures, including:\nNow Cypress, in a 6.3 x 6.5 x 1.65mm package (9mm-diagonal), brings the added and significant benefit of being 40x louder in low frequencies compared to xMEMS\u2019 prior generation speakers, providing stronger, deeper bass that is consistent with the best 10-12mm legacy coil speakers, including sound pressure levels (SPL) greater than 140dB as low as 20Hz*.\nMEMS and Ultrasonic Modulation Ideal for ANC Performance\nThis additional low-frequency SPL is most critical for ANC earbuds. With Cypress, xMEMS brings unique advantages over legacy coil to further improve ANC applications. Cypress\u2019 faster electrical-to-acoustic conversion can contribute to wider ANC bandwidth (i.e., extension of ANC to cancel higher frequency noise sources, like a crying baby). Plus, Cypress\u2019 near-constant electrical-to-acoustic conversion time (group delay), can reduce DSP filter complexity which, in turn, leads to shorter DSP latency, rounding errors, and power consumption when processing ANC.\nAvailability\nFull-function Cypress prototype silicon is now sampling to select early customers. Production-candidate samples of Cypress and the companion Alta controller/amplifier ASIC will sample in June 2024. Mass production is planned for late-2024.\nxMEMS will demonstrate Cypress by appointment only January 9-12 at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, NV.\nFor more information about xMEMS and its solid-state fidelity solutions, visit www.xmems.com\nRELATED POSTS\nShare this Article\nSpread the word about this Article\nMike is the founder and editor of Electronics-Lab.com, an electronics engineering community/news and project sharing platform.

The result is \u201crich, detailed, bass-heavy high-fidelity sound,\u201d according to xMEMS.\nCypress is described as more faithful to the original recording than current speaker technologies because the \u201csound envelope of ultrasonic pulses is an exact acoustic copy of the source signal.\u201d The concept of producing audible sound/music from ultrasound has been the topic of research and development for decades, though it has never achieved broad commercial success.\n\u201cCypress maintains all of the benefits of xMEMS\u2019 existing speakers, while being 40 times louder in low frequencies, achieving a key requirement for ANC [active noise canceling] earbuds,\u201d explained Mike Housholder, vice president of marketing and business development for xMEMS. \u201cBy shifting to a \u2018sound from ultrasound\u2019 principle, the xMEMS Cypress microspeaker can now officially replace traditional coil-and-magnet speakers in active noise canceling earbuds.\u201d\nxMEMS CTO Jemm Liang added: \u201cCypress not only revolutionizes how sound can be reproduced from an electric signal, but it also redefines how it should be reproduced.\u201d\nThe ability to produce increased SPLs at low frequencies is particularly important for ANC earbuds. \u201cCypress\u2019 faster electrical-to-acoustic conversion can contribute to wider ANC bandwidth,\u201d according to the company.

The technology leverages the same production-proven platform used for existing xMEMS products and exploits the benefits of solid-state speaker design, including increased reliability, near-zero phase shift, superior part-to-part phase consistency for more accurate spatial imaging, and faster mechanical response for improved detail, clarity, and separation.\nWorking samples are expected in June of 2024 with mass production to follow in late in the year. xMEMS has not indicated which brands will be the first to adopt the technology.

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nxMEMS\u2019 breakthrough micro-speakers debut in earbuds at CES\nAt this year\u2019s CES, Santa Clara-based xMEMS Labs has been showing off newly released, first-generation earbuds from Creative Labs and Noble Audio utilizing the developer\u2019s\u00a0breakthrough MEMS micro-speakers.\nWhat is MEMS (short for \u201cmicro electrical mechanical systems\u201d) technology all about? We\u2019re talking about \u201cmicroscopic moving structures inside a silicon chip,\u201d detailed Mike Housholder, the company\u2019s marketing and business development VP. \u201cThey actuate to move air, creating pressure which generates sound. There are some actual moving parts in these microchips, but their flexing is so minute it can\u2019t be seen by the naked eye.\u201d\nThose all-silicon solid-state components deliver better reliability, part-to-part consistency, and equal-to-better (eventually) pricing, Housholder argues. \u201cAnd for the consumer, we think [the MEMS speaker] has the most accurate reproduction you\u2019re going to get.\u201d (We covered xMEMS\u2019 MEMS micro-speakers in detail earlier this year.)\n\u201cAlmost every component in electronic devices has moved to solid state, with the exception of the \u2018coil and magnet\u2019 driven dynamic speaker,\u201d Housholder noted. But with its MEMS technology, xMEMS aims to put the kibosh on that last holdout.\nThe best of the new MEMS-fitted earbuds I tried in the developer\u2019s CES suite were the Aurvana Ace 2 ($149) and\u2013almost as good\u2013the $129 Aurvana Ace, both from Creative Labs, which demonstrated a well-balanced, natural, and effortlessly\u00a0detailed performance on a wide variety of music, from pop (Olivia Rodrigo) to cool jazz (Miles Davis) and even bombastic classical (Carl Orff\u2019s Carmina Burana.)\nCreative Labs Aurvana Ace earbuds are first to exploit MEMS solid-state micro-speakers\nJonathan Takiff/Foundry\nBut had I looked under the hood, I would have seen that the buds\u2019 two-way coaxial design was actually a bit of new-tech-meets-old-tech. That\u2019s because buds are utilizing xMEMS\u2019 Cowell-model MEMS chip to produce the scintillating high frequencies, while conventional dynamic drivers tackle the bass and mid-range duties.\nThat will change next year, when the chip designer introduces yet another and equally staggering breakthrough in its Cypress-series MEMS: an ultrasonic signal coding and decoding process that could boost the micro-speaker\u2019s bass response by a factor of 40, meaning it wouldn\u2019t need help from a friend.\nImproved low-frequency sound pressure levels would allow the Cypress chip to support active noise cancellation, which requires 140 decibels of signal-cancelling muscle power to do its job.\u00a0The Cypress series also makes the micro-speaker technology ripe for high resolution and spatial audio, says the developer.\nAudio delivery schemes riding on ultrasound waves have been a research topic since the 1960s, and until now, they\u2019ve never achieved a performance level good enough for broad audience appeal. But a prototype Cypress micro-speaker I got to hear kicked plenty of butt.\nNoble Audio\u2019s MEMS-equipped Falcon Max are exclusive to the Japanese market, whle their FoKus Triumph will be available worldwide.\nJonathan Takiff/Foundry\n\u201cCypress uses a modulator to generate an amplitude modulated ultrasonic wave carrier that faithfully follows the amplitude of the intended audio signal,\u201d Housholder explained, \u201cand a demodulator to synchronously demodulate the ultrasonic wave, transferring the acoustic energy down to the baseband, which is the audio signal. So we\u2019re now using ultrasound as the pressure generator instead of just pushing air, which is the conventional mechanism for generating sound.\u201d\nxMEMS also demonstrated the effective capabilities of its technology with its prototype over-the-ear \u201cPresidio\u201d headphone, which is likely to show up next year under a different brand name. This design deploys the solid-state Cowell micro-speaker in a two-way architecture.\n\u201cThe Cowell is mounted in this little compression horn, functioning as the tweeter, with a dynamic driver in the back,\u201d Housholder explained. \u201cThis takes a lot of weight out. It simplifies the design. A lot of effort goes into tuning the back volume of the headphone to get the mids and the highs sounding right. The MEMS drivers don\u2019t care about back volumes. So you can make this back shell thin, [and] save a lot of design time and complexity.\u201d\nAs if that wasn\u2019t enough, xMEMS Labs is also hoping to make a dent in the sleep-buds category with a yet-to-be-named headset that integrates a unique \u201cdynamic vent\u201d in addition to one of its specialty chips. This user-controlled mechanical vent can be left open when your environment is quiet, or cued to close if your bedmate is snoring the night away.\nI was told the vent closure will cut outside sounds by 30 decibels, but with the less-than-perfectly fitted prototype I tried on, the dampening was only promising at best.\nAuthor: Jonathan Takiff, Freelance Contributor\nJonathan Takiff is a veteran tech and entertainment writer based in Philadelphia.

Our Skyline DynamicVent leverages a noise-detecting microphone and DSP to vent the ear and reduce these occlusion effects that could disrupt sleep. But when outside noise is detected, the vent will close to achieve the best noise isolation. All told, this technology takes the sleep buds category to new levels of usability and more importantly, comfort.\u201d\nSkyline can be closed for superior noise blocking, or opened to vent the ear and reduce occlusion effects. If required, during times of louder noises, xMEMS\u2019 Cowell MEMS micro speaker can also be turned on to provide noise-masking sounds that work in conjunction with the noise blocking eartips and closed vent.\nThe reference design is available to xMEMS partners, customers and equipment manufacturers to serve as a starting point for their own product innovations. The design consists of a pair of tiny wireless earbuds and a charging case, similar to consumer true wireless earbuds. Inside the earbuds are the xMEMS Cowell micro speaker, the Skyline DynamicVent, a MEMS microphone and a Qualcomm QCC5171 true wireless stereo system-on-chip for Bluetooth connectivity and DSP functions.\nAttendees who visit the xMEMS suite at CES 2024 will also get to experience other revolutionary solutions, including:\nCypress: World\u2019s first ultrasonic amplitude modulation speaker to achieve >140dB low frequency SPL for ANC True Wireless Stereo earbuds.\nPresidio: Two-way, over-ear headphone reference design using a 35mm dynamic driver for bass and xMEMS Cowell or Montara Plus as a tweeter for superior mids and highs. Both xMEMS products provide high speed and phase coherence to significantly improve the soundstage and ensure pinpoint positioning of individual instruments for music or background sound effects for modern gaming.\n2-way true wireless earbuds: Creative Aurvana Ace2 and Noble Audio Falcon Max using xMEMS Cowell tweeter.\nCowell is the world\u2019s smallest solid-state micro speaker and delivers superior high-frequency response and clarity, plus a wider sound stage, for TWS earphones and hearing aids. Montara Plus, the world\u2019s highest output MEMS micro speaker, is capable of sound pressure levels up to 120 dB @ 200 Hz, making it an ideal full-bandwidth transducer for audiophile-grade in-ear monitors and high-end over-ear headphones.\n\u201cCES is the premiere destination to launch and demo the technologies that will shape not only the products we buy, but the processes behind how those products are produced,\u201d Housholder concluded. \u201cThrough sleep buds and various other reference designs at CES 2024, xMEMS is demonstrating how our world-first all-silicon, monolithic MEMS micro speakers and DynamicVent products deliver exceptional sound quality, comfort, and style for consumers, while unlocking new efficiencies for manufacturers through our solid state semiconductor manufacturing process \u2013 which delivers a better sounding speaker with far greater production efficiency and product uniformity.\u201d\ngriffin360 \u00a0| \u00a019 W. 21st St., New York, NY 10010 \u00a0| \u00a0212.481.3456 \u00a0| \u00a0connect@griffin360.com"

These tiny speakers come in many forms, from piston-like dynamic drivers you\u2019d recognize as miniature speaker cones to more advanced forms of, essentially, magnetically moving a diaphragm in the air to create sound waves.\nIn my time as an audio reviewer, dozens of companies have claimed to have the best, cleanest, most perfect driver technology ever. Some of it has sounded really great, but fundamentally every model I've tried was still operating on the same technology available to us when Jimmy Hendrix was window-shopping for Fender Stratocasters (9/10, WIRED Recommends): magnets and metals.\nIn the mid-2020s, headphones are finally headed to solid state. Thanks to innovations from xMEMS, a California startup that wants to print headphone drivers the same way one typically makes microchips, we\u2019re closer than ever to headphones that sound utterly perfect in all environments, even if you accidentally put them through the wash.\nWith major manufacturers like Creative Labs on board to add these drivers to next-gen wireless earbuds, and a few high-end products already on the market, the future of portable sound is finally peeking around the corner.\nThe future of headphones, it turns out, may have been in our pockets for about a decade. MEMS technology (the acronym stands for \u201cmicro-electromechanical systems\u201d) uses the piezoelectric effect and silicon chips to, in the case of many cell phones, capture audio from the outside world as a microphone. These MEMS-based mics are easy to manufacture, don't require much calibration, and are extremely consistent, but they don't exactly sound fantastic.\nThe folks at xMEMS have spent the past few years working with new materials developed in 2015, essentially reversing microphone technology to make it a speaker. The end result is a driver that is among the flattest and most responsive of any I\u2019ve ever heard, and one that can be made en masse entirely without human sorting\u2014previously impossible in headphone land.\nIt\u2019s very rare that a product lives entirely up to the hype that\u2019s presented, but xMEMS\u2019 Montera drivers, as tested inside a pair of $1,500 Singularity Industries Oni headphones, via a special $1,100 iFi xMEMS amp, sound like nothing I\u2019ve ever heard before.\nFor one thing, the earbuds have an utterly flat frequency response down to about 20 Hz. That means every part of the mix is able to stand on its own, with nothing becoming too prominent due to the headphones alone. But the secret sauce the xMEMS drivers bring to the table isn\u2019t just near-linear frequency response, it's in their speed. Unlike traditional membrane-based drivers, the piezoelectric effect utilized by MEMS technology is sub-millisecond fast (about 150X faster than older driver technology), which means each note comes through more clearly.\nLauren Goode\nJulian Chokkattu\nNena Farrell\nLauren Goode\nImagine jumping on a trampoline to create sound: The MEMS drivers aren\u2019t jumping very high, while traditional dynamic drivers are bouncing to the ceiling before they can reset to their original shape.\nSuch speed means remarkable separation between instruments and a soundstage where bassier songs don\u2019t lose mid or upper range. It\u2019s like looking through crystal clear glass where you previously could see smudges.\nWell-produced mixes sound great, especially ones that might sound a bit muddy or dark on other systems. On Loudon Wainwright III\u2019s acoustic rhapsody \u201cHollywood Hopeful,\u201d you can hear the strings of the guitar rattle near the microphone clearly on the right side of the soundstage, with his speech-song vocals biting at the entire middle of your consciousness. The separation between instruments and sense of musical space is speaker-like. The next thing that pops up on my playlist is NRQB\u2019s \u201cMagnet.\u201d The electric bass is propellant, like a tiny set of wheels that push the music forward, fully in earshot because of the excellent low-frequency response of the xMEMS drivers.\nIt\u2019s the low end that I find most enthralling about these new drivers. It\u2019s extremely present and clean; you can hear every note in the bass. Unlike with dynamic drivers, there isn\u2019t the same eardrum-pumping feeling down low you\u2019d expect with bass this apparent and separated in the mix. Some companies are reportedly experimenting with adding a dynamic or balanced armature driver to the earbuds for punch. At least in these earbuds, it\u2019s not needed.\nThe best way I can describe the xMEMS experience is that it is one of absolute, unabashed clarity. You hear exactly what everything sounds like in a mix, with virtually no color from the drivers themselves. It\u2019s utterly liberating, but it can make bad mixes\u2014anything with an unbalanced midrange, weird panning, or too much high end\u2014immediately stand out. You might hate how some favorite old records translate to a set of headphones with this much clarity. I found a few mixes shockingly awful through such a clear window.\nObviously the drivers\u2019 characteristics, their speed and separation, are exaggerated to the highest degree inside this pair of custom-milled titanium earbuds and the purpose-built amp. The scary thing for hi-fi nerds is that I have also demoed preproduction sample units of much more affordable earbuds with the xMEMS drivers inside, and they sound very close to this good. The drivers are naturally flat up to the high-end of the frequency spectrum, which means that they can be easily tuned by manufacturers using EQ and acoustic design.\nxMEMS headphones don\u2019t require more power than traditional earbud drivers, so they\u2019d essentially fit inside any existing pair on the market as long as form factor and impedance allow. (These headphones run on an inverse impedance curve compared to normal drivers, and the iFi amp has a special DC bias to power them.) It\u2019s a small change, a trade-off for such excellent and repeatable sound, and one that can, the folks at xMEMS assure me, be easily designed into earbuds and dongles given existing power restrictions. The company makes a tiny 1.9 mm x 1.9 mm chip that can easily power its drivers.\nLauren Goode\nJulian Chokkattu\nNena Farrell\nLauren Goode\nThe robustness of the drivers is another big plus. These can be treated like utter crap and still sound great, according to the company. The masochists at xMEMS proudly claim they\u2019ve gotten them really hot, cold, and wet, and ran them through a full wash and dry cycle, and the drivers still come back perfectly in spec. The joys of solid state.\nThe best part about xMEMS\u2019 driver tech? It doesn\u2019t appear to be a mirage on the horizon so much as a plane that\u2019s rapidly coming in for landing. Creative, a brand that has long been at the forefront of audio technology and itself made some pretty decent wireless earbuds, will have two pairs of xMEMS-based headphones for under $200 on the market before the end of the year.\nSingularity's high-end earbuds (the ones I\u2019m listening to) already exist and are for sale, as are another pair from Soranik ($1,200). The company continues to innovate and create new and better drivers, such as the new Cypress it announced recently. I expect that many brands, especially at the higher end of earbuds, will follow suit as soon as they spend time with the technology.\nThe new drivers might not be substantially cheaper than previous dynamic or balanced armature options (the company claims they are more expensive than dynamic drivers, about the same as high-end balanced armature drivers), but they make up for that in ease of manufacturing, the fact that they don\u2019t have to be sorted by humans or matched, and, of course, the fact that they create such incredible sound. The folks at xMEMS point out that MEMS microphone technology is still slightly more expensive than the previous technology used in cell phones, yet it's still the market leader due to the many benefits it offers in a macro sense.\nBetween innovations like this new solid-state driver technology and the latest Qualcomm chipsets for wireless earbuds meaning lossless audio transmission and Wi-Fi-based streaming, it\u2019s gearing up to be a very exciting decade for earbuds. In 10 years, we might listen back to the original AirPods (7/10, WIRED review) and think they sound like AM radio. As someone who loves to make music as much as I love to listen to it, I can't wait for everyone else to experience such true-to-life musical performance at attainable prices.\nSimon Hill\nJulian Chokkattu\nReece Rogers\nAdrienne So\nGear Team\nGear Team\nGear Team\nLauren Goode\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
