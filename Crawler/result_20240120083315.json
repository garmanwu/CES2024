This product is unique in that it consists of two motorised skis, each featuring a wheel at the front and back, a carbon composite deck, front and rear running lights, a quick-swappable lithium-ion battery, and snowboard-style bindings. The skis are powered by 600-watt hub motors in each wheel, resulting in a total power of 2,400 watts. These electric skis are designed to replicate the experience of downhill skiing, with pneumatic all-terrain tires that allow usage on various surfaces including on- and off-road.\nThe skis are controlled by a wireless handheld remote, which is used for acceleration, braking, and monitoring the battery life. The Skwheel One can reach a top speed of 80km/h (50mph) on private land, with an electronically limited speed of 25km/h (16mph) for other uses. The skis include an electronic braking system, along with a mechanical emergency brake at the back and a parking brake at the front. Another interesting feature is the remote's ability to clip the skis together, transforming them into a wheeled suitcase for easy transportation.\nThe Skwheel One skis have a combined weight of 12.5kg (28lb) and offer a range of about 30km (19 miles) on a single charge lasting three hours. They are also IP64 water-resistant, making them resilient against sprays from any direction.\nShare This Article\nRelated Articles\nMeet the startup with the world\u2019s tallest autonomous robot\nEnchanted Tools at CES 2024\nVTOUCH INC at CES 2024\nHestia by Vaonis at CES 2024\nGet in Touch\nContact Us\nFooter Menu 1\nFooter Menu 2\nFooter Menu 3\nFooter Menu 4\nStartups Magazine.

These devices, which can travel up to 80km/h in the countryside and 25km/H in the city, are supposed to reproduce the sliding sensations promised by this winter sport. Skwheel produces and assembles them in Normandy.. Will they soon flourish on the streets of Paris, like scooters, gyropods, hoverboards and other monowheels in recent years?\nThese devices, which can travel up to 80km/h in the countryside and 25km/h in the city, are supposed to reproduce the sliding sensations promised by this winter sport. Skwheel produces and assembles them in Normandy.\nWill they soon flourish on the streets of Paris, like scooters, gyropods, hoverboards and other monowheels in recent years? The very young start-up Skwheel, based between Paris and Normandy, took advantage of CES 2024 to try to make noise around its first product: electric skis called Luna-One.\nAn unusual product at first glance, which consists of 4-wheel drive, two mounting systems where the legs are positioned, several braking systems including an emergency mechanical one at the rear, as well as a lever to accelerate and brake. \"It's designed to travel up to 80 km/h in the countryside and stuck at 25 km/h in urban areas. The wheels are suitable for bitumen, sand and gravel,\" explains Romain Massebeuf, co-founder of the start-up.\nRead alsoAt the CES in Las Vegas, the tsunami of artificial intelligence is sweeping over everyday objects\nThanks to a pivot system placed on the front wheel that the start-up has patented, Luna-One makes it possible to reproduce the sensations of skiing on all types of surfaces, including the sculling characteristic of winter sports. \"It's a product I've been working on for more than 7 years, with a lot of prototypes, and which combines my two passions for engineering and skiing, which I couldn't do because I didn't have the means when I was younger,\" laughs Antoine Massebeuf, president and co-founder with his brother of Skwheel.\nRange of 30 kilometres\nWith a range of 30 kilometres, Luna-One is equally suitable for commuting to and from work in urban areas as well as for outings in the mountains, for example. Charging takes 2 hours. Since the batteries are removable, users who want to go on longer rides will be able to replace them easily.\nFour reflectors, as well as two headlights at the front of the machine, allow the product to be found and seen. This is essential, given the proliferation of micromobility devices on the roads in recent years and the need for good understanding with other types of vehicles. The device will be subject to the regulation of motorized personal mobility devices, such as electric scooters and others. Skwheel promises a quick handling, even for those not used to skiing, and a learning curve of barely half an hour to master the object.\nRead alsoCES in Las Vegas: with 150 start-ups on site, French Tech still very well represented\nThe production is 100% carried out in Normandy. The start-up, which is only a year and a half old, currently has three employees. The two Massebeuf brothers, one from the world of supply chain and the other from the world of robotics, have joined forces with a third to develop the commercial part. It hopes to produce up to 800 pairs of shoes in 2024, and launched a crowdfunding campaign on Sunday (January 7) to ramp up the scale. The pair of electric skis, which should be sold at around 2200 euros, will benefit from a reduction in the coming weeks to reach 1600 euros.\nSource: lefigaro\nAll news articles on\n2024-01-09\nYou may like\nTrends 24h\nLatest\nDecision in the Budget Committee: Budget for 2024 is in place2024-01-18T18:46:37.660Z\nA tremendous diplomatic achievement: the European Parliament in a precedent-setting decision regarding the ceasefire and the abductees Israel today2024-01-18T18:46:31.171Z\nMysterious murder of a jogger in the Loiret: a 34-year-old man arrested more than fifteen years after the events2024-01-18T18:46:13.622Z\n\u201cHe who is free from sin should cast the first stone\u201d: Geraldine Fern\u00e1ndez accepts that she did not participate in the film 'The Boy and the Heron'2024-01-18T18:46:01.910Z\nSam Altman, the boss of OpenAI, worries about the energy gap of AI2024-01-18T18:45:56.004Z\nMale body found in Frankfurt city forest \u2013 evidence of violent crime2024-01-18T18:45:50.335Z\nBundestag approves law for simplified deportations2024-01-18T18:45:44.989Z\nThe France pavilion of the Dubai World Expo recycled in Marseille?2024-01-18T18:45:33.115Z\nSud-Essonne: faced with delinquency, no new gendarmerie brigade but reinforcements2024-01-18T18:38:31.953Z\nFlight staff reveal secret codes: If they call you \u201cPhilip\u201d on the plane, things are bad for you2024-01-18T18:38:26.334Z\n\u201cIt\u2019s a city that runs through my veins\u201d: Guy Carlier talks about his childhood at the Argenteuil Book Fair2024-01-18T18:38:13.794Z\nIntestinal problems and shingles: Empress Sisi's previously lost medical records have been discovered2024-01-18T18:37:56.313Z\nAttempted fire on the Morlaix mosque: a suspect in police custody2024-01-18T18:37:44.630Z\nLaurence de Charette: \u201cThe planned end of excellence at school\u201d2024-01-18T18:37:39.036Z\nWedding scandal in Austria: Groom arrested at the wedding \u2013 authorities justify their actions2024-01-18T18:37:27.227Z\nThe connection line for the R\u00fcgen LNG terminal is complete2024-01-18T18:37:20.981Z\n\u201cNo connection with reality\u201d: to Stanislas, parents, teachers and students revolted by the controversy2024-01-18T18:37:07.481Z\nFarmer protests: Why farmers are so angry2024-01-18T18:37:00.827Z\nAll information about jungle camp candidate Felix von Jascheroff2024-01-18T18:36:48.871Z\nMore than twice as much as Uli Hoene\u00df: Bavarian building contractor buys his freedom for a deposit worth millions2024-01-18T18:36:42.898Z\nFray Paolo, the Franciscan monk in medieval attire who advises the Pope on Artificial Intelligence2024-01-18T18:36:30.993Z\nFrom the choice of private to the report on \u201cStan\u201d: Am\u00e9lie Oud\u00e9a-Cast\u00e9ra, seven days in the storm2024-01-18T18:36:19.737Z\n5,000 euros subsidy for the pension \u2013 the deadline expires at the end of January2024-01-18T18:36:14.038Z\nEvan Gershkovich imprisoned in Russia: the American ambassador visited the Wall Street Journal journalist2024-01-18T18:36:02.637Z\nGaza: Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon tackles St\u00e9phane S\u00e9journ\u00e9 after his refusal to accuse Israel of genocide2024-01-18T18:35:57.091Z\n\u201cThrowing shit at us\u201d \u2013 forced eviction from \u201cHartz und cordial\u201d Simone2024-01-18T18:35:51.256Z\nChildren and screen addiction: \u201cI recommend the \u201c4 steps\u201d method of the American Academy of Pediatrics\u201d2024-01-18T18:35:39.729Z\nRecord oil production in the United States2024-01-18T18:35:33.530Z\nDespite the opposition of the police -
