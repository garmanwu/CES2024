Reduce Your Carbon Footprint\nSwitching to solar is a great way to reduce dependency on fossil fuels. Solar power is reliable and renewable, green energy that comes from the sun, energy you can use to power your life and your household.\nSolar power means clean energy. Grid power equals dirty energy. Homeowners who switch to solar reduce stress on the grid while promoting eco-friendliness.\n2.) Save Money\nNow that solar power has been around for a while, cost of components and installation is steadily decreasing. According to the\u00a0National Renewable Energy Laboratory, there has been a 60% to 82% reduction in overall cost of residential, commercial-rooftop, and utility-scale photovoltaic systems.\nNot only this, converting to solar energy will also help you save money on your utility bills. Pairing your solar energy system with the grid will give you the ability to provide excess energy to the grid while receiving credits toward your monthly energy bill. Over time, you stand to recoup the cost of installation with the savings you get from converting to solar energy.\n3.) Emergency/Disaster Preparedness\nSolar power comes through in the clutch during emergencies and disasters. Opting for battery storage gives you the ability to hold onto your stored energy, which can be used during blackouts, outages, and unforeseen emergencies.\nWith the PowerPillar ESS you can seamlessly switch from grid to stored solar energy, which will help keep you powered through good times and uncertain times.\n4.) Promote Green Energy\nOnce you make the shift to solar you\u2019ll inadvertently become a solar energy spokesperson. Your neighbors, friends, and colleagues will likely ask you about your transition to green energy. You can tell people your story and spread the word, making a positive impact in your community in the process.\nSwitching to solar will also help with\u00a0job creation in the green energy sector. When you invest in solar power you are supporting installation, maintenance, and manufacturing, which helps keep specialized and skilled workers gainfully employed.\n5.) Own Your Power\nIf you\u2019re relying on the grid for all your power needs, you\u2019re rolling the dice. In the event of an outage or a disaster, you\u2019re not going to be able to power your appliances, electronics, or even crucial medical devices. Geneverse is here to help you avoid that.\nOur PowerPillar ESS promotes true energy independence. You get to choose how you want to use your power \u2013 whether you want to send it back to the grid to reduce your utility bill or store it for a rainy day. In an effort to bring green energy to the masses, we\u2019ve created the most cost-effective energy storage system available on the market. There\u2019s never been a better time to switch to solar and Geneverse is here to make it easy every step of the way.\nAbout Geneverse: Geneverse is the most reliable and cost-efficient source for solar energy. Our\u00a0PowerPillar ESS\u00a0integrates solar power, battery storage, not to mention grid and generator power sources that help our customers get the most out of their energy storage investment \u2013 all at the most competitive pricing on the market.

The battery can operate in rugged conditions, discharging at temperatures as low as -4 degrees F.\nThe 3000 Pro has an updated cooling system controlled by high-precision chips and nine sensors, which Jackery said improved heat dissipation efficiency by 30%. The battery bank operates quietly below 30 decibels when charging in silent mode. The bank is also equipped with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi to communicate with and be controlled by mobile devices.\nGeneverse HomePower PRO Plus\nGeneverse introduced the HomePower PRO Plus, a portable solar generator that can be converted to an on-grid generator system for home backup. The device can be controlled through an app to perform grid services like peak demand shaving, running appliances at costly times on the grid to avoid steep utility charges.\nThe battery comes with a 4838 Wh capacity, 4400 W of rated power, and a surge power of 8800 W. The surge outlet supports up to 30 A, offering a useful alternative power source for contractors, RV travelers, and other uses beyond the home.\nThe PRO Plus is housed in a motorized \u201ccart\u201d for easy of portability and contains 18 outlets hidden beneath sliding panels. The system is comprised of two modular Geneverse batteries that can be removed for flexible use. The product will be available in early Q2 2023.\nThe battery\u00a0can charge by the AC wall outlet in under two hours, or by solar in two to four hours. Geneverse also offers a Solar Pergola, an eight-foot-tall fold-out canopy that provides shade and powers the battery bank.\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Geneverse to Showcase Insanely Versatile Solar Generator at CES 2023\nGeneverse to Showcase Insanely Versatile Solar Generator at CES 2023\nIn clear aspirations of summer weather (at least for those of us in New England), Geneverse has announced they\u2019ll be introducing the new HomePower PRO Plus (alongside a unique solar-powered take on the traditional pergola) at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2023. Plugged as an efficient and incredibly versatile battery backup system, the HomePower PRO Plus can even be converted into an in-grid generator system in minutes, should the homeowner require it.\nHaving a background in both the smart home and generator industries, Geneverse aims to make delivering home energy independence a very tangible reality for homeowners and professionals. The company\u2019s solar generators are designed to be used in a variety of locations (including mobile applications) and can even safely be used indoors.\nThe company also has the Geneverse Home Energy Audit, which pairs the generator with the Geneverse App to gauge how much energy appliances use. Rather than having the highest energy-guzzlers in the home run from a wall outlet during peak hours, Geneverse instead allows homeowners to run the devices off of the Geneverse generator during those times.\n\u201cIt\u2019s an honor for our team to kick off the New Year by debuting the latest in solar generators and sustainable home backup system technology at the world\u2019s most influential tech event,\u201d says Geneverse CEO, Anson Liang. \u201cWe\u2019re proud to be able to offer more powerful and versatile solutions to make energy usage smarter. We\u2019re continuing to create better and more efficient ways to store energy and utilize smart power in the home as part of our roadmap to making energy independence a possibility for all.\u201d\nA Sneak Peak at the Geneverse HomePower PRO Plus\u2026\nDebuting for the first time at CES 2023 is the all new Geneverse HomePower PRO Plus, a complete power system solution. According to Geneverse, the PRO Plus has a capacity of 4838Wh, 4400W of rated power and a surge power of 8800W. The surge outlet supports up to 30 amps, providing the perfect alternative power source for contractors, RV travelers, beyond traditional use in the home.\nThe Future of Digital Lighting & Control\nThe company also notes that this \u201cbig-hitter\u201d is housed in an ergonomic motorized \u2018cart\u2019 for ease of portability and includes the Genverse Transfer Switch, a power box capable of turning the portable generator into an in-grid generator in minutes.\nThe PRO Plus ecosystem also features sliding panels for access to 18 available outlets, and a sleek modern look for any setting. And as this system\u2019s design consists of two Geneverse backup systems housed within the cart, these can be separated for different use case demands for even more versatility, as stated by the company.\nThe HomePower PRO Plus will be available early Q2 2023.\n\u2026And Solar Pergola?\nYes, you heard that correctly. In a smart move to sync with the smart home, that home addition usually used to block out the sun has now been designed to eat the sun, thanks to Geneverse. The 8-foot tall expandable pergola is made of easy-fold solar panels (a photovoltaic ceiling) that are designed to more efficiently capture the sun\u2019s energy, according to Geneverse.\nThe company notes that is commonly used as a functional, yet stylish addition to a home can now be converted into a power source for an existing Geneverse Solar Generator, maximizing the potential and utility of outdoor entertainment spaces.\nAttendees of CES will also get a glimpse of Geneverse\u2019s whole home backup system expected to hit the market summer 2023.\nThis article has been updated as of 01/17/23 to ensure the validity of information provided.\nIf you enjoyed this article and want to receive more valuable industry content like this, click here to sign up for our digital newsletters!\nARTICLE TOPICS\nARTICLE TAGS\nSHARE\nSHOW NEWSLETTER\nCE Pro\nContent Types\nNewsProductsProjectsCompaniesDownloadsWebcastsPodcastsEvents\nSpecials\nCompany Info\nAboutContact UsCustomer ServiceAdvertise with Us\nSubscribe\nConnect\nTwitterFacebookLinkedInYouTubeRSS Feed\nCategories"

It opened my garage double door, runs my refrigerator, microwave, toaster oven and 55-inch TV.Has a great warranty of 5 years which can be extended to 10 years for only $129. Great asset since I am off the coast of South Carolina.\nJames |HomePower TWO PRO Power Station\nVery satisfied. The components, panels and generator appear to be very well constructed. Used the solar panels to bring the storage up to 100%, then used it to power 1/2 corded drill, belt sander, and saws, all on a home project. I recorded the power remaining in the battery, stored it in my garage for 2 weeks in cold conditions, then checked power. Held steady.\nHenry |HomePower ONE Solar Generator\nBought this for a friend who uses a CPAP machine but loves to camp.It was hard for them to find a good, reliable way to power their CPAP without worrying about it not working or being a super noisy gas generator. This looked like the best all-around option, so I clicked \"purchase\". It arrived quickly. We charged it fully at home to try it out b4 taking it into the woods. Our friend used it two full nights and the battery still had a 65% charge. Awesome! My friend has been so bummed not being able to go camping, so this was a game changer for them.\nCarol |HomePower ONE Solar Generator\nJust received the generator. I fully charged it and did a quick test run - everything worked as I had hoped for and expected. Beautifully designed and space saving, with sufficient power to run all essential items (fridge, wifi router, sump pump, some lights, etc.) for many hours. Should be sufficient for the occasional power outage in our area that usually lasts anywhere from two to six hours. The design of this generator (or power bank) is so cool that I could actually place it next to my high-end stereo and it would look like an expensive amplifier! By the way, it was very well packaged, so no shipping damage.\nHans |HomePower 2 Plus Solar Generator\nI just bought the HomePower ONE Series bundle and already used the generators for a power outage. Easy to use, quiet, just plug in and go. We powered our refrigerator and portable air conditioner.I am going to buy another bundle soon to give one to my daughter.\nDonna | HomePower ONE Solar Generator\nBeautiful boxed. Quality construction. I tested the battery and it ran our refrigerator for over 10 hours. The battery recharged from the house outlet in less than an hour. My next test will be using the car lighter cable provided.\nBrian | HomePower ONE PRO Power Station\nI have been trying out various appliances, etc. along with recharging using the solar panels. I was impressed by how quickly the panels recharged the battery. We had one of those short power outages recently, so I used my HomePower TWO PRO to open my garage door. I do have a couple of suggestions. I find it difficult to lift, so my nephew put it on a cart to move it around. Also, I would love if you offered a vinyl cover. All in all, I am very pleased with the product and what it can power.\nMary |HomePower TWO PRO Solar Generator\nAs a low tech, single, retired person on a fixed income I saved & researched solar generators before purchasing. Thus far, I am thrilled with my HomePower ONE PRO. From multiple calls to Geneverse prior to purchase till today, I couldn't be happier. It's as easy to use as plugging in a lamp & pushing a button!Since all portable generators are heavy, I purchased a utility cart on casters to make moving, using, & storing my generator + accessories a breeze. Now, I no longer worry about power outages, fuel, fumes, maintenance, etc.\nKelly | HomePower ONE PRO Solar Generator\nWhere Geneverse Has Been Featured\nAt Geneverse, our goal is to make home energy usage smarter and more self-sustainable in order to empower families and communities with energy independence.\n-\nNeed Help or Have Questions?\nTalk to a Geneverse Expert at 1-(800)-210-8665\nShop Geneverse\nQuick Links\nSign Up for Our Newsletter and\nGet $100 Off!\nJoin the Geneverse Club to receive exclusive deals, promotions, and tips!\n\u00a9 2024 Geneverse.\nAll rights reserved.
