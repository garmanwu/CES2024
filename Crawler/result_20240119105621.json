        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Best of CES 2024: From 4K Projectors to Neural Headphones, Here Is the Best Tech to Look Forward to This Year\nThe Consumer Electronics Show features thousands upon thousands of tech products and we narrowed it down to the best.\nBy\nRudie Obias\nRudie Obias\neditor\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\nEvery year, the best and brightest companies in tech come to Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show \u2014\u00a0otherwise known as CES \u2014\u00a0to announce and showcase new entertainment, audio & video, wellness, household and transportation products for the year ahead.\nOver five days at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels and casinos, we visited booths, press conferences, presentations and participated in countless tech demos to find the best of the best of CES. These brands and products were chosen based on usefulness, function, innovation and overall cool factor.\nWe narrowed down the winners in a number of categories from laptops to robot vacuums and smart home devices to 4K TVs. We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar. The LG Soundbar S95TR is a 9.1.5-channel sound system that comes with 65-inch soundbar with three up-firing speakers, rear speakers and a subwoofer for your TV, while the system is Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and DTS:X compatible for immersive and detailed audio. It also connects wirelessly to just about any LG 4K TVs via WOWcast.\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nIf you\u2019re alone, but needed a portable solution to dynamic Zoom video calls or just making a TikTok video, the Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit is a very cool and useful way to make self-tracking videos with your Apple iPhone.It\u2019s MagSafe and NFC (Near Field Communication), so all you have to do is attach your iPhone and Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro will track and follow your body and face. During our time with the product, it appeared to move smoothly and effortlessly with 360-degree rotation and 90-degree tilt. wMeanwhile, it has up to five hours of use per charge and works in-app with TikTok, Zoom, Instagram and more.Belkin has it priced at $179.99, while the tech company has yet to announce availability.\nMaster & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic partnered with a neuroscience company called Neurable to deliver a pair of wireless headphones that can your track work sessions and measure your stress levels through your brain waves through a mobile app. They can even recommend when you should take a break when you\u2019re deep into your work.Aside from their focus capabilities, Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones offer premium audio quality with active noise cancellation and up to 32 hours of battery life per charge. The headphones are available for pre-order for $649 with delivery in early 2024.\nJBL Live 3 Earbuds\nNot only do the JBL Live 3 Earbuds feature world-class audio that crisp, clear and rich with active noise-cancellation, they offer something that most premium wireless earbuds do not \u2014\u00a0a charging case with a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen display. Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line. It has an AMOLED touchscreen display that comes in three case sizes (42mm, 47mm and 51mm), while the watch comes with an LED flashlight, a heart rate monitor, blood oxygen monitor, step and calorie counter and a built-in GPS with up to a whopping 16 days of battery life per charge.In our brief testing period, the Garmin Epix Pro appeared to be durable and solid since it\u2019s made with premium materials, such as stainless steel, a fiber-reinforced polymer, a steel rear cover and Corning Gorilla Glass. It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top.

The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience.

In the future, we will continue to support local smallholder organic farms so employees can enjoy access to safe and organic food ingredients.\n\u00c2\n\u00e5\u2022\u201c\u00e7\u00a2\ufffd\u00e7\u00a7\u2018\u00e6\u0160\u20ac\u00e7\ufffd\u00b2\u00e9\u00a0\u2019\u00e7\u00b6\u00a0\u00e8\u2030\u00b2\u00e9\u00a4\ufffd\u00e9\u00a3\u00b2\u00e6\u0152\u2021\u00e5\ufffd\u2014\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e3\u20ac\u01522023\u00e4\u00bc\ufffd\u00e6\u00a5\u00ad\u00e7\u00b6\u00a0\u00e9\u00a3\u0178\u00e5\u2026\u02c6\u00e8\u00a1\u0152\u00e7\ufffd\u017d\u00e3\u20ac\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e8\u201a\u00af\u00e5\u00ae\u0161\u00e4\u00ba\u2020\u00e9\u20ac\u2122\u00e5\u00b9\u00be\u00e5\u00b9\u00b4\u00e4\u00be\u2020\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e7\u2019\u00b0\u00e4\u00bf\ufffd\u00e6\u02c6\ufffd\u00e6\u017e\u0153\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\u00e7\u00a7\u2030\u00e6\u0152\ufffd\u00e8\u2018\u2014\u00e8\u00ae\u201c\u00e5\u201c\u00a1\u00e5\u00b7\u00a5\u00e5\ufffd\u0192\u00e5\u02c6\u00b0\u00e3\u20ac\u017d\u00e5\u00ae\u2030\u00e5\u00bf\u0192\u00e7\u201e\u00a1\u00e6\u00b1\u2122\u00e6\u0178\u201c\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e5\u00a5\u00bd\u00e9\u00a3\u0178\u00e6\ufffd\ufffd\u00e3\u20ac\ufffd\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e5\u02c6\ufffd\u00e8\u00a1\u00b7\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e5\u2022\u201c\u00e7\u00a2\ufffd\u00e5\u2026\u00a8\u00e5\ufffd\u00b0\u00e5\ufffd\u201e\u00e6\u201c\u0161\u00e9\u00bb\u017e\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e5\u201c\u00a1\u00e5\u00b7\u00a5\u00e9\u00a4\ufffd\u00e5\u00bb\u00b3\u00e6\u017d\u00a1\u00e7\u201d\u00a8\u00e6\u0153\u2030\u00e6\u00a9\u0178\u00e8\u201d\u00ac\u00e8\ufffd\u0153\u00e5\u00b7\u00b2\u00e9\u20ac\u00be\u00e5\ufffd\ufffd\u00e5\u00b9\u00b4\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e4\u00b8\u0192\u00e5\ufffd\u0192\u00e5\ufffd\ufffd\u00e5\u201c\u00a1\u00e5\u00b7\u00a5\u00e5\ufffd\u2014\u00e6\u0192\u00a0\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\u00e5\u017d\u00bb\u00e5\u00b9\u00b4\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e5\u2022\u201c\u00e7\u00a2\ufffd\u00e7\u00a7\u2018\u00e6\u0160\u20ac\u00e6\u02c6\ufffd\u00e7\u201a\u00ba\u00e7\u00ac\u00ac\u00e4\u00b8\u20ac\u00e5\u00ae\u00b6\u00e5\u00a4\u00a7\u00e5\u017e\u2039\u00e4\u00bc\ufffd\u00e6\u00a5\u00ad\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e7\u00b6\u00a0\u00e9\u00a3\u0178\u00e5\u00ae\u00a3\u00e8\u00a8\u20ac\u00e8\u00a1\u0152\u00e5\u2039\u2022\u00e5\u20ac\u00a1\u00e8\u00ad\u00b0\u00e5\u00ba\u2014\u00e5\u00ae\u00b6\u00ef\u00bc\u203a\u00e4\u00bb\u0160\u00e5\u00b9\u00b4\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e9\u2122\u00a4\u00e4\u00ba\u2020\u00e6\u2030\u201c\u00e9\u20ac\u00a0\u00e5\ufffd\u2039\u00e5\u2013\u201e\u00e7\u2019\u00b0\u00e5\u00a2\u0192\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e7\u00b6\u00a0\u00e8\u2030\u00b2\u00e5\u2022\u2020\u00e5\u00a0\u00b4\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e6\u203a\u00b4\u00e9\u00bc\u201c\u00e5\u2039\u00b5\u00e5\u201c\u00a1\u00e5\u00b7\u00a5\u00e8\u2021\u00aa\u00e5\u201a\u2122\u00e9\u00a4\ufffd\u00e5\u2026\u00b7\u00e3\u20ac\ufffd\u00e5\u00ae\u00a3\u00e5\u00b0\u017d\u00e5\u00bb\u0161\u00e9\u00a4\u02dc\u00e6\u00b8\u203a\u00e9\u2021\ufffd\u00e5\u2019\u0152\u00e8\u02c6\u2030\u00e8\u00be\u00a6\u00e7\u2019\u00b0\u00e4\u00bf\ufffd\u00e9\u203a\u2020\u00e9\u00bb\u017e\u00e6\u00b4\u00bb\u00e5\u2039\u2022\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\u00e6\u0153\u00aa\u00e4\u00be\u2020\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e6\u02c6\u2018\u00e5\u20ac\u2018\u00e5\u00b0\u2021\u00e6\u0152\ufffd\u00e7\u00ba\u0152\u00e6\u201d\u00af\u00e6\u0152\ufffd\u00e5\u0153\u00a8\u00e5\u0153\u00b0\u00e6\u0153\u2030\u00e6\u00a9\u0178\u00e5\u00b0\ufffd\u00e8\u00be\u00b2\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e4\u00bb\u00a5\u00e5\u201e\u00aa\u00e8\u00b3\u00aa\u00e9\u00a3\u0178\u00e6\ufffd\ufffd\u00e5\u00ae\u02c6\u00e8\u00ad\u00b7\u00e5\u201c\u00a1\u00e5\u00b7\u00a5\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e5\ufffd\u00a5\u00e5\u00ba\u00b7\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e5\u2026\u00bc\u00e9\u00a1\u00a7\u00e6\u201e\u203a\u00e8\u00ad\u00b7\u00e5\u0153\u0178\u00e5\u0153\u00b0\u00e8\u02c6\u2021\u00e7\u201d\u0178\u00e6\u2026\u2039\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\n#GreenDining #ESG #Sustainability #GreenRestaurant\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n8,305 followers\n#WNC received an SGS Green Mark Award, carbon management category, in recognition of its achievements in #CarbonManagement. 2023 is the first year that SGS has held these awards and WNC is honored to be recognized in this way.\n\u00c2\u00a0WNC has been making great efforts in carbon management in recent years. We have completed a GHG inventory for all the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sites and office buildings and have a number of other energy conservation projects in place.\nAdditionally, in 2023, four modules and system products underwent a carbon footprint inventory. WNC continues to build up its own materials footprint database, taking carbon emissions into consideration during materials selection and product development processes to reduce carbon emissions at the source.\nMoving forward, WNC will continue to promote carbon management projects for business operations and products and raise awareness of carbon reduction initiatives among

(WNC), a leading provider of communications solutions, and EdgeQ Inc, a leader in 5G wireless infrastructure, have partnered to introduce the world\u2019s first software-defined, multi-mode 4G/5G small cell at this year\u2019s Mobile World Congress Barcelona. The collaboration between the two companies enables a new paradigm for telco operators and enterprise customers looking for a singular design that converges 4G and 5G networks, spans indoor and outdoor environments, scales across multiple antennas, and offers field-upgradeable software within a compact unit for frictionless deployment.\nWNC\u2019s newest small cell (LAS1) offers a converged 4G and 5G network that is field upgradable through software with a modular RF antenna design. Supporting Power over Ethernet, the all-in-one small cell integrates compute, connectivity, and cloud functionalities while achieving up to 5 Gbps throughput. Samples of the LAS1 are now available.\n\"WNC has implemented the world\u2019s first dual Radio Access Technology (RAT) small cell product based on EdgeQ\u2019s solution,\" said Stephen Sek, Chief of Technology, US and EU Technology Centers at WNC. \"With our proprietary 2T2R and 4T4R antenna design and an extremely power-efficient EIRP of up to 30 dBm, we are well-positioned to support the next generation of applications requiring over 1 Gbps of user throughput.\"\nThe partnership between WNC and EdgeQ validates how open innovation at the silicon level drives new performance dimensions at breakthrough economics. The highly scalable, flexibly adaptive EdgeQ platform targets both gNB and O-RAN applications in a completely softwarized manner. By compacting 4G, 5G, and compute into a single-chip, EdgeQ enables an all-in-one small cell with fully integrated Radio Unit (RU), Distributed Unit (DU), and Central Unit (CU); L1, L2, L3 stacks, and fully inclusive ORAN splits. The scalable architecture packs unprecedented throughput performance across a large set of concurrent users, but all within a compact power envelope enabling Power-Over-Ethernet.\n\"EdgeQ has imagined a highly flexible, softwarized 5G platform that is cohesive, low power, and remarkably disruptive. Together with WNC, we are introducing to the industry an elegant design that can fulfill the many dimensions of 5G, all the while driving towards new economics and operating simplicity like Wi-Fi,\" said Adil Kidwai, Head of Product Management at EdgeQ.\nThe WNC LAS1 small cell and EdgeQ\u2019s Base Station-on-a-Chip can be seen at Hall 2 - 2A4MR.\nTo learn more about WNC\u2019s LAS1 small cell, please visit https://www.wnc.com.tw.\nTo learn more about how EdgeQ is pioneering the 5G infrastructure market, please visit www.edgeq.io.\nAbout WNC\nWistron NeWeb Corporation (WNC) specializes in the design, development, and manufacturing of cutting-edge communications products.

While the car itself may not be any closer to moving out from being a concept, Sony had some fun with it: they drove it onto the stage with a PlayStation controller.\nPresident of Sony Honda Mobility Izumi Kawanishi was quick to point out that Afeela owners likely won\u2019t be driving cars using controllers in the future.\n\u2014\u2014\nHYUNDAI SEES A FUTURE IN HYDROGEN\nJose Munoz, president and global CEO of Hyundai Motor Company, speaks during a Hyundai news conference before the start of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung have unveiled transparent TVs at the show, with LG having just announced its OLED-powered display will go on sale later this year.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u2019s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode.\n\u201cThe unique thing about OLED is it\u2019s an organic material that we can print on any type of surface,\u201d explains David Park from LG\u2019s Home Entertainment Division.\n\u201cAnd so what we\u2019ve done is printed it on a transparent piece of glass, and then to get the OLED picture quality, that\u2019s where we have that contrast film that goes up and down.\u201d\nContent is delivered wirelessly to the display using LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box which sends 4K images and sound.\nWhy would you need a transparent TV?\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, the OLED T can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\nSamsung\u2019s transparent MICRO LED-powered display showed off the technology as a concept.\n___\nADS COMING TO SHOPPING CARTS\nFood companies advertise all over the grocery store with eye-catching packaging and displays. Now, Instacart hopes they\u2019ll start advertising right on your cart.\nThis week at CES, the San Francisco-based grocery delivery and technology company is unveiling a smart cart that shows video ads on a screen near the handle. General Mills, Del Monte Foods, and Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream are among the companies who will advertise on the carts during an upcoming pilot at West Coast stores owned by Good Food Holdings.\nInstacart says a screen might advertise deals or show a limited-edition treat, like Chocolate Strawberry Cheerios. It might also share real-time recommendations based on what customers put in the cart, like advertising ice cream if a customer buys cones.\nInstacart got into the cart business in 2021 when it bought Caper, which makes smart carts with cameras and sensors that automatically keep track of items placed in them. Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: Everything you need to know about the camera and tech showcase\nThe world's biggest technology show, CES 2024 is taking place in Las Vegas next week.\u00a0What camera kit will be there?\nCES 2024, the biggest technology event in the world, is taking place next week \u2013\u00a0and it's going to be the site of some huge announcements in the world of electronics.\nAs always (at least, when there's not a pandemic), CES 2024 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada and runs from January 09-12. Last year saw 117,000 visitors and 3,200 exhibitors at the event, including the biggest technology giants such as Google and Microsoft.\nOf specific interest to us, of course, are the imaging giants who are participating at this year's show: Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Adobe. While CES 2024 is a general technology showcase, not one dedicated to photography or videography in specific, it has been used as a launchpad for cameras and imaging tech. And with both video and AI being cornerstones of this year's event, we're sure to see some exciting launches.\nFull details on the show can be found at the CES website.\u00a0For now, here's what we're excited about and what we expect to see\u2026\nWhen is CES 2024?\nCES 2023 will take place in its traditional home of Las Vegas, Nevada, running from Tuesday January 09 to Friday January 12.\nThe event emanates from the Las Vegas Convention Center. If you're in the area, attendance details are on the CES website.\nWhat do we expect at CES 2024?\nSony\nWord has it that Sony could announce five cameras this year, among them the Sony A1 II, A7S IV, FX3 II and ZV-E10 II. With all of these featuring headline video capabilities, it would certainly be the right time and place to debut at the video-obsessed CES.\nPersonally I think it's waaaaaay too early for a Sony A1 successor, though with a new rumor that the company could replace the Sony A7S III (and the A7S line altogether) and the Sony FX3 with the FX3 II, this feels like a new pillar that would be well-cemented in Las Vegas.\nPanasonic\nThere's been plenty of chatter about replacements for the Panasonic S1 / S1R, Panasonic S1H and Panasonic GH6. And given that the company launched the Panasonic S5X and S5 IIX last January, it's entirely possible that an S1R II, S1H II and GH7 could be revealed at CES 2024.\nOf course, as a general tech giant, we could see plenty of other adjacent imaging breakthroughs. At last year's show Panasonic announced \"life changing\" smart glasses, made in conjunction with Biel Glasses, using AI to help users with impaired vision.\nHeck, maybe we might finally see Panasonic announce something 8K-related\u2026\nCanon\nWill CES 2024 be the launchpad for the highly anticipated Canon EOS R1? We all know that the new flagship is on the way, and that it's intended to launch in time for the Paris Olympics, so time is running out for Canon to show it to the world.\nThere are plenty of other possibilities, too. The Canon EOS R5 II feels a little ambitious, but Canon has a habit of showcasing its latest collection of concept cameras \u2013\u00a0many of which have made it to market, such as the Canon PowerShot Zoom and Canon PowerShot Pick. These are always fascinating glimpses into the future, and I'm excited to see what's on show this year!\nNikon\nAfter a knockout year in 2023, Nikon could capitalize by taking the bull by the horns early in 2024. The likeliest candidate to me would be the Nikon Z6 III, which is widely expected to be here any minute.\nThere has also been a wild rumor about a Nikon Z9H \u2013\u00a0a speed-oriented version of the Nikon Z9. The \"H\" is ostensibly a nod to the suffix Nikon used to give to its flagship cameras to denote particular performance specialisms \u2013\u00a0such as the Nikon D1H, which was a speed-oriented upgrade of the base D1.\u00a0Personally I'll believe this one when I see it!\nFujifilm\nThis feels like a bit of a long shot, as Fujifilm is usually more at home announcing products on its home turf at CP+. That said, with reports that the manufacturer will launch more cameras in January alone than it did in 2023 as a whole, a launch or announcement isn't out of the question.\nWhat could this be? Well, a follow-up to the Fujifilm X100V is widely expected \u2013 and given what a blockbuster success that camera was, it could be a good fit for the broader-appeal of CES 2024. An outside chance would be the Instax Mini 99, which sounds like it might be a disruptive product.\nCES 2024 announcements\nLaCie Rugged Mini SSD\nThe palm-sized LaCie Rugged Mini SSD has been announced in capacities up to 4TB offering IP54 dust and rain resistance, 3-meter drop protection and 1-ton car pressure resistance.\u00a0No need to baby your portable SSD any more!\nLaCie claims write speeds of up to 2000MB/s, with USB 3.2 gen 2x2 and compatibility with USB 40Gbps, USB 10Gps, Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts including the latest Apple iPad, iPhone and Macbooks. Prices start at $79.99 for 500GB and go up to $349.99 for 4TB.\nFull story: LaCie adds to its famous Rugged lineup with a new palm-sized SSD\nWith a good few days to go until the event kicks off, there will be plenty more news, announcements and leaks between now and doors opening. Stay tuned to this page where we'll keep you updated with all the launches as they happen!\nWe're expecting to see some of the best cameras for video and maybe even the best cameras for vlogging announced at the show, along with AI improvements to the best photo editing software and the best video editing software.\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\nGet the Digital Camera World Newsletter\nThe best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!\nThe editor of Digital Camera World, James has 21 years experience as a journalist and started working in the photographic industry in 2014 (as an assistant to Damian McGillicuddy, who succeeded David Bailey as Principal Photographer for Olympus).

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "NEW MEXICO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT\nWind-Tower Manufacturer Picks New Mexico for Expansion\nArcosa chooses Belen to expand its wind-tower manufacturing business.\nDallas-based Arcosa, Inc., a manufacturer of infrastructure-related products and solutions, announced that Arcosa Wind Towers, an Arcosa subsidiary, will open a wind-tower production facility in Belen and anticipates hiring 250 New Mexico employees.\nNew Mexico was chosen over other locations due to its supportive partnerships and competitive incentives, the company said.\n\u201cWe look forward to expanding our manufacturing capacity to New Mexico, where market demand for new wind projects is robust,\u201d Antonio Carrillo, President and CEO of\u00a0Arcosa, Inc.,\u00a0said. \u201cOur new facility will strengthen our position in the wind-tower market and enable Arcosa to benefit from growing wind investment in the Southwest. We are pleased to create new jobs in the State of New Mexico, which has been a supportive partner and a strong proponent of wind-energy development.\u201d\nArcosa has received new orders for wind towers totaling $750 million, with the majority of those for projects in New Mexico and the Southwest. Arcosa Wind Towers is purchasing an existing facility, formerly occupied by Keter, along a Burlington Northern rail spur at 1951 Highway 304, Belen, in the Rio Grande Industrial Park. The facility will service the increased demand in wind-energy development, in part fueled by the federal Inflation Reduction Act.\nGov. Lujan Grisham has identified sustainable energy as a target industry to receive additional strategic economic development assistance as New Mexico diversifies its economy to attract higher-paying jobs. Arcosa Wind Towers is one of several new businesses that has chosen to expand or relocate to the state since the Governor-led Energy Transition Act became law in 2019.\n\u201cThe transition to clean energy brings with it more diversified, higher-paying and skilled jobs,\u201d Gov. Lujan Grisham said. \u201cArcosa is repurposing an old factory for new investments in our state and our communities \u2013 this is a win-win.\u201d\nThe State of New Mexico\u00a0is contributing $4 million from its Local Economic Development Act (LEDA) job-creation fund to assist with the New Mexico manufacturing expansion. Funding will be provided as the company meets agreed-upon economic development benchmarks.\n\u201cEDD\u2019s strategy to focus on job-rich industries and bring better quality jobs to New Mexico is working,\u201d Economic Development Department Cabinet Secretary Alicia J. Keyes said. \u201cNow we need to build on our successes and move forward to aggressively support the growth of new and existing businesses that can improve the lives of our families and the health of our communities.\u201d\nThe company will not only qualify for LEDA but can apply for assistance through EDD\u2019s Job Training Incentive Program (JTIP), which reimburses companies for a portion of employee training costs. New Mexico also has other incentives for manufacturing and the hiring of high-wage workers. The City of Belen is planning assistance through Industrial Revenue Bonds (IRBs).\n\u201cI am pleased to welcome Arcosa Wind Towers to Belen and Valencia County. The anticipated creation of 250 jobs is vital to our local workforce and economy. I am excited that Belen and Valencia County have been chosen by a company that brings over 85 years of expertise to infrastructure-related projects and look forward to having them in our community,\u201d City of Belen Mayor Robert Noblin said.\nArcosa expects to have an annual New Mexico payroll of $12.5 million and the project is estimated to have an economic impact of $314 million over the next 10 years. The company plans to invest $55 to $60 million to purchase the property, modify the existing plant, and procure equipment. Production at the Belen facility is expected to begin in mid-2024 with current orders and backlog providing a healthy level of production through 2028.\n\u201cArcosa Wind Towers will bring a major economic boost to the City of Belen and Valencia County,\u201d Steven Tomita, Belen\u2019s Development Services Director, said. \u201cBelen has played a major role in the development of the industrial park over the years, including construction of the rail spur and bringing in the industrial manufacturers. We are looking forward to Arcosa\u2019s new 250 higher-paying jobs. It is also exciting that a major renewable energy manufacturing company will be establishing themselves in our community.\u201c\n\u201cArcosa Wind Towers is a leading manufacturer of structural wind towers in North America. To have a company that is so highly respected in North America coming to Belen is a huge step in our growth and shows how the City of Belen is dedicated to industrial businesses coming into our community,\u201d Joshua J. Kerns, City of Belen Community & Economic Development Director added.\nArcosa is a provider of infrastructure-related products and solutions with leading brands serving construction, engineered structures, and transportation markets. Its individual businesses have built reputations for quality, service, and operational excellence over decades. Arcosa serves a broad spectrum of infrastructure-related markets and is strategically focused on driving organic and disciplined acquisition growth to capitalize on the fragmented nature of many of the industries in which it operates. Arcosa operates in three major segments: construction, transportation, and engineered structures.\nArcosa (NYSE: ACA) is a publicly traded company on the NYSE.

For over a decade, cafeterias at WNC sites in Taiwan have been using locally sourced organic produce, benefiting 7,000 employees. Last year, #WNC became the first large-scale enterprise to join the Green Food Declaration. This year, besides turning its cafeterias into green marketplaces, WNC has encouraged employees to bring their own food containers, promoted methods of reducing kitchen waste and organized lucky draws for employees who participate in environmental protection activities. In the future, we will continue to support local smallholder organic farms so employees can enjoy access to safe and organic food ingredients.\n\u00c2\n\u00e5\u2022\u201c\u00e7\u00a2\ufffd\u00e7\u00a7\u2018\u00e6\u0160\u20ac\u00e7\ufffd\u00b2\u00e9\u00a0\u2019\u00e7\u00b6\u00a0\u00e8\u2030\u00b2\u00e9\u00a4\ufffd\u00e9\u00a3\u00b2\u00e6\u0152\u2021\u00e5\ufffd\u2014\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e3\u20ac\u01522023\u00e4\u00bc\ufffd\u00e6\u00a5\u00ad\u00e7\u00b6\u00a0\u00e9\u00a3\u0178\u00e5\u2026\u02c6\u00e8\u00a1\u0152\u00e7\ufffd\u017d\u00e3\u20ac\ufffd\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e8\u201a\u00af\u00e5\u00ae\u0161\u00e4\u00ba\u2020\u00e9\u20ac\u2122\u00e5\u00b9\u00be\u00e5\u00b9\u00b4\u00e4\u00be\u2020\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e7\u2019\u00b0\u00e4\u00bf\ufffd\u00e6\u02c6\ufffd\u00e6\u017e\u0153\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\u00e7\u00a7\u2030\u00e6\u0152\ufffd\u00e8\u2018\u2014\u00e8\u00ae\u201c\u00e5\u201c\u00a1\u00e5\u00b7\u00a5\u00e5\ufffd\u0192\u00e5\u02c6\u00b0\u00e3\u20ac\u017d\u00e5\u00ae\u2030\u00e5\u00bf\u0192\u00e7\u201e\u00a1\u00e6\u00b1\u2122\u00e6\u0178\u201c\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e5\u00a5\u00bd\u00e9\u00a3\u0178\u00e6\ufffd\ufffd\u00e3\u20ac\ufffd\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e5\u02c6\ufffd\u00e8\u00a1\u00b7\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e5\u2022\u201c\u00e7\u00a2\ufffd\u00e5\u2026\u00a8\u00e5\ufffd\u00b0\u00e5\ufffd\u201e\u00e6\u201c\u0161\u00e9\u00bb\u017e\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e5\u201c\u00a1\u00e5\u00b7\u00a5\u00e9\u00a4\ufffd\u00e5\u00bb\u00b3\u00e6\u017d\u00a1\u00e7\u201d\u00a8\u00e6\u0153\u2030\u00e6\u00a9\u0178\u00e8\u201d\u00ac\u00e8\ufffd\u0153\u00e5\u00b7\u00b2\u00e9\u20ac\u00be\u00e5\ufffd\ufffd\u00e5\u00b9\u00b4\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e4\u00b8\u0192\u00e5\ufffd\u0192\u00e5\ufffd\ufffd\u00e5\u201c\u00a1\u00e5\u00b7\u00a5\u00e5\ufffd\u2014\u00e6\u0192\u00a0\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\u00e5\u017d\u00bb\u00e5\u00b9\u00b4\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e5\u2022\u201c\u00e7\u00a2\ufffd\u00e7\u00a7\u2018\u00e6\u0160\u20ac\u00e6\u02c6\ufffd\u00e7\u201a\u00ba\u00e7\u00ac\u00ac\u00e4\u00b8\u20ac\u00e5\u00ae\u00b6\u00e5\u00a4\u00a7\u00e5\u017e\u2039\u00e4\u00bc\ufffd\u00e6\u00a5\u00ad\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e7\u00b6\u00a0\u00e9\u00a3\u0178\u00e5\u00ae\u00a3\u00e8\u00a8\u20ac\u00e8\u00a1\u0152\u00e5\u2039\u2022\u00e5\u20ac\u00a1\u00e8\u00ad\u00b0\u00e5\u00ba\u2014\u00e5\u00ae\u00b6\u00ef\u00bc\u203a\u00e4\u00bb\u0160\u00e5\u00b9\u00b4\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e9\u2122\u00a4\u00e4\u00ba\u2020\u00e6\u2030\u201c\u00e9\u20ac\u00a0\u00e5\ufffd\u2039\u00e5\u2013\u201e\u00e7\u2019\u00b0\u00e5\u00a2\u0192\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e7\u00b6\u00a0\u00e8\u2030\u00b2\u00e5\u2022\u2020\u00e5\u00a0\u00b4\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e6\u203a\u00b4\u00e9\u00bc\u201c\u00e5\u2039\u00b5\u00e5\u201c\u00a1\u00e5\u00b7\u00a5\u00e8\u2021\u00aa\u00e5\u201a\u2122\u00e9\u00a4\ufffd\u00e5\u2026\u00b7\u00e3\u20ac\ufffd\u00e5\u00ae\u00a3\u00e5\u00b0\u017d\u00e5\u00bb\u0161\u00e9\u00a4\u02dc\u00e6\u00b8\u203a\u00e9\u2021\ufffd\u00e5\u2019\u0152\u00e8\u02c6\u2030\u00e8\u00be\u00a6\u00e7\u2019\u00b0\u00e4\u00bf\ufffd\u00e9\u203a\u2020\u00e9\u00bb\u017e\u00e6\u00b4\u00bb\u00e5\u2039\u2022\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\u00e6\u0153\u00aa\u00e4\u00be\u2020\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e6\u02c6\u2018\u00e5\u20ac\u2018\u00e5\u00b0\u2021\u00e6\u0152\ufffd\u00e7\u00ba\u0152\u00e6\u201d\u00af\u00e6\u0152\ufffd\u00e5\u0153\u00a8\u00e5\u0153\u00b0\u00e6\u0153\u2030\u00e6\u00a9\u0178\u00e5\u00b0\ufffd\u00e8\u00be\u00b2\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e4\u00bb\u00a5\u00e5\u201e\u00aa\u00e8\u00b3\u00aa\u00e9\u00a3\u0178\u00e6\ufffd\ufffd\u00e5\u00ae\u02c6\u00e8\u00ad\u00b7\u00e5\u201c\u00a1\u00e5\u00b7\u00a5\u00e7\u0161\u201e\u00e5\ufffd\u00a5\u00e5\u00ba\u00b7\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\u00e5\u2026\u00bc\u00e9\u00a1\u00a7\u00e6\u201e\u203a\u00e8\u00ad\u00b7\u00e5\u0153\u0178\u00e5\u0153\u00b0\u00e8\u02c6\u2021\u00e7\u201d\u0178\u00e6\u2026\u2039\u00e3\u20ac\u201a\n#GreenDining #ESG #Sustainability #GreenRestaurant\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n8,305 followers\n#WNC received an SGS Green Mark Award, carbon management category, in recognition of its achievements in #CarbonManagement. 2023 is the first year that SGS has held these awards and WNC is honored to be recognized in this way.\n\u00c2\u00a0WNC has been making great efforts in carbon management in recent years. We have completed a GHG inventory for all the group\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s manufacturing sites and office buildings and have a number of other energy conservation projects in place.\nAdditionally, in 2023, four modules and system products underwent a carbon footprint inventory. WNC continues to build up its own materials footprint database, taking carbon emissions into consideration during materials selection and product development processes to reduce carbon emissions at the source.\nMoving forward, WNC will continue to promote carbon management projects for business operations and products and raise awareness of carbon reduction initiatives among
