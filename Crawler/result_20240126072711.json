        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6. Devices, peripherals, and accessories\nOf the hundreds of new products revealed at CES 2024, Spiceworks gives a shoutout to the following for\nWhat was your favorite CES 2024 highlight?

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: Evolution and Revolution\nThough AI was a popular buzzword, faster and better designed products dominated\nCES, the world\u2019s leading trade show, is back! Yes, there were in-person versions of the show in 2022 and 2023, but this year is the first since 2020 that felt \u201cnormal.\u201d The halls were crowded full of eager attendees, the show floors were packed with booths and most of the companies we usually visit with at CES had a presence.\nGoing into the show, we expected to hear the word \u201cAI\u201d every five seconds that we talked with vendors, but in the enthusiast tech world, we heard it a bit less often than our colleagues who cover TVs, appliances and phones at other websites. Instead, it seems that nothing beats good design, more processing power and a positive user experience.\nIntel and the laptop vendors which use its CPUs showed off various local AI workloads, which mostly involved generating images or managing power profiles And AI underpins Nvidia\u2019s gaming technologies. But there are only so many times we can prompt Stable Diffusion\u2019s GIMP plugin to draw a cat driving a car, before we get bored. MSI is the one company that wowed us with a true AI innovation: a monitor that uses computer vision to analyze your game\u2019s map and point out where enemies are coming from.\nInsead, we were excited to see a number of products that really moved the ball forward in ways that were more evolutionary than revolutionary: new graphics cards and CPUs \u00a0that add more performance for the money, a high-end 3D printer that zooms along at 600 mm/s and works with carbon fiber or a gorgeous OLED monitor that can run at up to 480 Hz at 1080p or 240 Hz at 4K.\nThese are the 15 best products of CES 2024.\nBest Graphics Card: Nvidia RTX 4070 Super\nNvidia announced three new RTX 40-series Super model graphics cards, and AMD revealed its RX 7600 XT 16GB. While all four will vie for a spot on our list of the best graphics cards for gaming (and other uses), the one we're most excited about is\u2026 well, honestly it's a bit hard to nail things down. Nvidia provides more performance for a lower price than its existing non-Super cards, so things definitely moved in the right direction. AMD provides double the VRAM and slightly higher performance with its new GPU, at a higher price than the RX 7600. But none of the new models are all that surprising \u2014 we've been hearing rumors about both for several months at least. Still, if we have to just pick one for an award, it's the new RTX 4070 Super.\nFundamentally, you're getting about 93% of the RTX 4070 Ti, for 75% of the price. Alternatively, you're getting 22% more GPU than the RTX 4070 for the same price. More importantly, you're at least getting 12GB of high-speed GDDR6X memory, along with access to Nvidia's RTX technologies: DLSS, superior ray tracing, and AI tensor cores. Given the RTX 4070 already trades blows with the RX 7800 XT \u2014 slightly slower rasterization performance, much faster ray tracing and AI performance, and the RTX 4070 Ti does the same with the RX 7900 XT \u2014 Nvidia now effectively delivers a higher performance option at the same price.\nThe RTX 4070 Super launches next week, so check back then for our full review and benchmarks.\nRead more: Nvidia RTX 40-series Super models revealed\n\u2014Jarred Walton\nBest CPU: Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 8600G\nAMD rolled out its Ryzen 8000G \u2018Phoenix\u2019 lineup of APUs at CES 2024, beating Intel to the punch as the first company to bring purpose-built AI accelerators to the desktop PC -- its second such feat after it was the first to bring AI to laptops with the same XDNA-powered neural processing unit (NPU). The chips also boast a powerful integrated RDNA 3 graphics engine that AMD claims delivers 1080p-capable gaming performance, even in some AAA titles, albeit at the reduced fidelity settings we\u2019d expect from this class of chip.\nAs we\u2019ve seen in the past, AMD builds its APUs for the desktop using the same silicon as its laptop chips. In this case, AMD leverages the Phoenix architecture that employs the Zen 4 CPU architecture and RDNA 3 graphics engine. However, the lack of battery life concerns in desktop PCs allows the chip to run at higher power limits, thus unleashing the full power of the silicon. AMD\u2019s two flagship models, the Ryzen 7 8700G and the Ryzen 5 8600G, boast eight and six cores, respectively. AMD also brought its new APU lineup up to modern standards with support for AM5\u2019s DDR5 and PCIe 4.0 connectivity, crafting what should be exceptionally powerful processors given their accessible price point.\nAMD\u2019s APUs have historically dominated the entry-level gaming market because Intel doesn\u2019t have processors with powerful enough integrated graphics to provide meaningful gaming performance, even for the lowest-end gaming systems. AMD\u2019s previous-gen Ryzen 5 5600G has long been one of the \u00a0Best CPUs for gaming \u00a0due to its surprisingly strong graphics performance, and we expect the new models to assume that mantle once again.\nThe chips feature FSR, HYPR-RX, and Fluid Motion Frames support, competitive pricing, and bundled coolers for all three SKUs. The new Ryzen APU models are poised to dominate the entry-level gaming segment once again when they arrive on January 31, winning our pick for the best CPU of CES 2024.\nRead more: AMD launches Ryzen 8000G \u2018Phoenix\u2019 APUs, brings AI to the desktop PC\n-Paul Alcorn\nBest Gaming Monitor: Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP\nWhen it comes to the best gaming monitors, you often must make some hard choices regarding performance and maximum image quality. You can go with an IPS panel and get ultra-fast 500 Hz refresh rates but compromise on contrast and color. Or you can opt for an OLED panel, which offers vibrant colors and inky blacks but falls short of class-leading refresh rate performance.\nFortunately, Asus is coming to the rescue with its ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP gaming monitor, hoping to give gamers the best of both worlds. In its standard operating mode, the PG32UCDP seems like any other modern high-end 32-inch gaming monitor with a brilliant OLED panel, a 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution, a fast 240Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1,300 nits. There\u2019s enough resolution for productivity tasks when not gaming and plenty of performance overhead for 4K gaming with the best graphics cards.\nHowever, the real spicy action happens when you switch to Frame Rate Boost mode. Gamers can quickly toggle this setting on the monitor, which drops the resolution down to Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution and boosts the maximum refresh rate to 480 Hz. That next-level speed and performance put it on even footing with the Alienware AW2524H and AW2524HF, which have a native refresh rate of 480 Hz at Full HD resolution. However, those fraternal Alienware twins can hit 500Hz with an overlock setting in the OSD.\nStill, the ability for gamers to pick and choose when they want maximum resolution or maximum performance, all while maintaining the image quality advantages of OLED, must be commended. Asus also gets the basics right, with HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 connectivity, 90-watt USB-C Power Delivery, and an integrated KVM switch.\nWe\u2019ll be curious to see how the Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP performs once we get it in the lab.\nRead more: Asus announces two new OLED gaming monitors delivering 480 Hz at up to 1440p resolution\n--Brandon Hill\nBest Memory: Micron LPCAMM2\nMicron unveiled its new LPCAMM2 memory modules at CES 2024. Despite earlier announcements from competing companies, Micron will be the first to actually bring memory modules based on the new standard to market. Perhaps more important for those looking for the ultimate in performance, these new modules unlock speeds of 9,600 MT/s via LPDDR5X memory, a massive increase over the standard SODIMM peak of DDR5-6400. However, that\u2019s just one of the many advantages of this new memory form factor that will become common in performance-oriented laptops over the coming years.\nThe LPCAMM2 standard also promises to bring fast and power-efficient LPDDR5X memory to laptops in a removable form factor for the first time, meaning the memory chips are no longer required to be soldered directly to the motherboard. These new modules will replace the standard SODIMMs that dominate current laptops, but the innovative design consumes 80% less power and 64% less space inside the chassis, thus enabling longer battery life and even slimmer laptop designs. LPCAMM2 also provides a dual-channel memory interface from a single module, a first. The modules will come in 16, 32, and 64GB capacities at first, with room to grow up to 128GB of capacity in a single module in the future.\nThe power and space savings, not to mention the speed improvements, of Micron\u2019s LPCAMM2 are set to redefine our expectations for laptop memory, earning our award for the best memory of CES 2024.\nRead more: Micron displays next-gen LPCAMM2 modules for laptops at CES 2024\n\u2013Paul Alcorn\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14/G16\nAsus took classic, beloved laptops known for performance, portability, and even battery life, and made them sleeker than ever. The new Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16 are slimmer and have newer, more adult designs than before, and, well, it looks great. There's only so much you can do without a new GPU to push forward graphics, so Asus dug into the design.\nFor the G14, that does mean topping out at an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 and AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS, while the G16 uses up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and RTX 4090. Both have silver and black options with a stripe on the lid, rather than a garish massive ROG logo or AniMe Matrix. I'm not going to say it looks like it could double as a business laptop, but it's far more attractive.\nThey're also getting, on paper, really nice screens, with Asus' OLED Nebula displays. The 14-incher gets a 2880 x 1800 screen at 120 Hz, while the bigger 16-inch laptop goes to 2560 x 1600 at 240 Hz. In a brief trial, both looked great, and we're excited to see just how well they perform in real testing.\nRead more: Asus ROG Zephyrus gets a sleek, slim new look with AMD Hawk Point and Intel Core Ultra\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Laptop: Asus Zenbook Duo\nThis was a contentious category among the Tom's Hardware judges, with some favoring the HP Spectre x360 2-in-1's even approach to a refresh without reinventing the wheel, while others like the very-CES approach of the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid and its ability to run both Windows and Android with a tablet and base station. But the Asus Zenbook Duo kept coming up as an option that seemed like a refined idea at a price point that's not crazy.\nThe Zenbook Duo has a pair of 14-inch OLED displays and a detachable Bluetooth keyboard. It's an idea we first saw hit production in Lenovo's Yoga Book 9i, but that one had a U-series CPU and an origami kickstand that wasn't intuitive. Asus' Zenbook Duo's kickstand is permanently attached to the laptop, and it goes up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H. So it should be easier to use and more powerful. The Asus model has far more ports than the Yoga, including HDMI alongside two Thunderbolt 4 ports.\nWhile we don't have a final price for it, it's been suggested to us that it will hover around $1,500. If that sticks, it won't be a ridiculous price, considering the Yoga was almost $2,000 when we reviewed it.\nI did have a bit of trouble getting the early unit at Asus' briefing to stand up straight with the monitors side to side, but otherwise it seemed like a solid machine, and we're eager to see what it can do.\nRead more: Asus Zenbook Duo is a dual-screen foldable with two 14-inch OLED screens and Intel Core Ultra\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Gaming Handheld: MSI Claw\nOne way to make a splash at CES is to be the first to do something. And while the MSI Claw isn't the first modern handheld gaming PC, it is the first mainstream PC brand to use Intel Core Ultra processors (or Intel at all. Lenovo, Asus, and Valve all opted for AMD chips). It's also packing a bigger battery than other handhelds, even if MSI isn't exactly claiming record-breaking battery life.\nMSi is claiming that it's producing a more ergonomic device, and while the plastic did divide some of our editors on the show floor, we're looking forward to trying it in long-term use. The screen seems similar to the one on the Asus ROG Ally, but considering that was a pretty decent screen, it's hard to argue with.\nIntel improving in graphics means we get more competition in handheld gaming outside of the Kickstarter space. We're looking forward to seeing how Intel and MSI put their own mark on it with MSI Center M, XeSS, and other technologies.\nRead more: MSI Claw is the first gaming handheld to run on an Intel Core Ultra processor with Arc Graphics\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Cooling / DIY: Hyte Nexus Link\nIt\u2019s not easy to get excited about an ecosystem at a show like CES, but Hyte\u2019s Nexus Link was a standout for me.This cable-decluttering and system-building simplification platform is clearly a competitor to Corsair's iCue Link, with similar daisy-chained magnetic connectors and fans. But Hyte also offers magnetic RGB strips that use the same connector, and the products have a quirky but much more interesting design.\nNexus Link is powered by a quad-core Arm CPU housed in the screen built into the company\u2019s Thicc Q60 AIO cooler, which we first saw at Computex last year. It sports a thick 240mm radiator and chunky fans that the company claims will outperform any 360mm radiator currently on the market. So the importance of performance isn\u2019t getting left behind in the quest for clean design.\nIn my brief hands-on time with it, the whole Nexus Link ecosystem, from the hardware to the software, felt more refined, definitely more visually interesting, and arguably better built than what Corsair has done with iCue Link. That's a little shocking from a company so comparatively new and unknown.\nI will wait for the chance to build a Nexus Link system and spend some time with the software before I can say for sure how it compares to the competition from Corsair and Lian Li, and others. But on first impression, Hyte looks to be on the verge of pulling off a major upset in the DIY PC space.\nRead more: Hyte's Nexus Link ecosystem of RGB devices makes building rainbow PCs seem easier than ever\n\u2013Matt Safford\nBest PC Case: MSI MEG Maestro 700L PG\nWe saw quite a few PC cases designed to support motherboards with rear-facing connectors here at CES 2024, and MSI\u2019s Project Zero boards are some of the first to market using Maingear\u2019s patent. But most are fairly compact, and don\u2019t support full-size ATX options. MSI\u2019s large MEG Maestro 700L PG, though, supports up to E-ATX boards \u2013 like most of these cases, it will work with traditional motherboards as well). But the 700L PG takes the en vogue \u201cfishbowl\u201d case style to the next level, with the entire front and side panel made up of one massive curved piece of tempered glass.\nThe rest of the case is crafted from large panels of 2.5 mm-thick aluminum, and the dual-panel design hides the PSU behind the motherboard, along with all the wires and connectors. Don\u2019t worry about airflow, because fans or large radiators can be mounted in front of the motherboard, as well as on the top or bottom of the case.\nAs you might expect, this will be an expensive case, with an MSI rep telling us that it will cost around $400 when it arrives sometime in the next month or so. It\u2019s far from cheap, but if you crave that clean interior look with acres of glass to show off your GPU and other components, MSI\u2019s MEG Maestro 700L PG is arguably the prettiest of these kinds of cases we\u2019ve seen yet. But at the same time, just looking at that large bent piece of glass makes us more than a little nervous.\n\u2013Matt Safford\nBest Mouse: Mad Catz MMO 7+\nIt's been a while since we've seen Mad Catz \u2014 the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and then quietly revived under new ownership in 2018, but it hasn't exactly been making waves. But the brand is back at CES this year with a slew of gaming peripherals, including a new wireless version of an old classic: the MMO 7.\nThe new MMO 7+ is a wireless version of Mad Catz' classic MMO-focused multi-button mouse, with some improvements that bring it into 2024. It features a whopping 21 programmable buttons with a shift mode and five profiles for up to 210 inputs (okay, that's a little ambitious \u2014 but still, 21 buttons is pretty impressive). What's nice is that those 21 buttons are not just laid out in a 12-button side panel like most MMO mice have (see: Razer's Naga V2 Pro, Corsair's Scimitar Elite Wireless, etc), but are kind of... all over the mouse, which makes them easier to differentiate. Like the old MMO 7, it's modular and will come packaged with interchangeable palm rests and pinky rests, as well as a tool that will let you change the palm and thumb rest positions.\nAside from wireless connectivity (2.4GHz and Bluetooth) and a USB-C charging port, the MMO 7+ also features a Pixart PAW-3395 optical sensor, which has a maximum sensitivity of 26,000DPI, a maximum speed of 650 IPS, and up to 50 G's of acceleration, as well as customizable RGB lighting and a horizontal scroll wheel. The only real disappointment is battery life, which is currently rated at 40 hours \u2014 most gaming mice these days are hitting 75 - 120 hours, so that's a pretty big difference. Still, it's nice to see a mouse that's not just a stripped-down, ultra-lightweight, FPS-oriented pointer with the promise of unnecessarily high polling rates.\n\u2014 Sarah Jacobsson Purewal\nBest Keyboard: Cooler Master MK770\nWe've seen a lot of keyboards at CES 2024, and we actually saw this keyboard \u2014 or, well, the prototype of it \u2014 at CES 2023. But while we've seen a lot of gaming companies making keyboards to appeal to both gamers and keyboard enthusiasts, we haven't seen a lot of them also taking budget into account. Cooler Master's MK770 has all the premium features we've been looking for \u2014 gasket-mounted, hot-swappable, wireless with tri-mode connectivity, double-shot PBT keycaps, and more than one colorway \u2014 and it's set to cost just $119 when it launches this year.\nThe MK770 is also a 96-percent keyboard, meaning it's practically full-sized (minus some navigation keys) while still being relatively compact (or, well, as compact as you can get without sacrificing your number pad). It features a solid-feeling chassis with two sets of flip-out feet on the bottom \u2014 and cleverly-placed dongle storage under one of the flip-out feet, and has a programmable clickable volume knob. It's not the most feature-rich keyboard, but it's got everything you need for wireless gaming and it's hot-swappable.\n\u2014 Sarah Jacobsson Purewal\nBest Innovation: MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED\nBigger, faster, more colorful. Those are three aspects that we typically track when new monitors are announced. For example, ASRock is making waves with its new 27-inch 520Hz gaming monitor, and vibrant OLED monitors are becoming more commonplace. But what if a company could make a monitor smarter? That's not something we'd thought about until now, with the introduction of the MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED and its onboard AI acceleratoOne feature of the AI hardware, dubbed SkySight, can automatically pinpoint and mark enemies on the screen in games like League of Legends. Instantly knowing what direction your enemies are coming from \u00a0is a definite perk, even if you could do the tracking with your own eyes.\nAll the AI processing is performed onboard the monitor and is undetectable since there is no intervention from your operating system or other installed software. We could see this being frowned upon by competitive gamers as an unfair advantage, but the underlying technology that frames SkySight is intriguing.\nThe MEG 321URX even features what MSI calls a Spectrum Bar (basically, a thin RGB strip) that sits below the display. Once again, using League of Legends as an example, the Spectrum Bar can light up to mirror your character's current health status. Even though League of Legends was the primary focus of MSI's CES demos, the company plans to release software for training to detect on-screen items for just about any game. It would be cool to see the Spectrum Bar used to mimic shift lights that you would see on a steering wheel on an F1 driver's steering wheel in games like EA's F1 23.\nLooking past the AI intrigue, the MEG 321URX's specs sheet is impressive in its own right, with a 32-inch 4K QD-OLED panel. The monitor can even achieve 240Hz at that native resolution with a 0.03ms response time. It also features a USB-C port with 90-watt power delivery, HDMI 2.1, and DisplayPort 1.4 support.\nKeep an eye out for the MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED when it debuts this spring.\nRead more: MSI's AI-powered gaming monitor helps you cheat at 'League of Legends,' looks great doing it\n--Brandon Hill\nBest 3D Printer: Creality K1C\nCreality\u2019s flagship K1 printer was already excellent, providing high-quality output at speeds as high as 600 mm/s. However, the K1 isn\u2019t perfect and there are a few things that Creality fans had wanted from it, including the ability to sustain higher temperatures and work with more exotic filaments.\nEnter the Creality K1C, which takes everything we like about the K1 and builds upon it. The new printer features an all-metal hotend which allows it to operate at a steady 300 degrees and therefore work with carbon fiber (that\u2019s what the C in K1C is for). The printer also has a revised bowden tube path, better build plate and other improvements we don\u2019t know about yet (the company has not released full specs). One of the leading 3D printer companies has a new leading device.\nRead more: Creality unveils new flagship K1C 3D printer and latest Ender 3 V3 model\n\u2013 Avram Piltch\nBest SSD: Phison PCIe 5.0 powered drives and controllers\nPhison previewed its E26 Max14um firmware prior to CES, and we saw multiple drives that should soon hit retail with performance of up to 14 GB/s. The key to enablement of the Micron 2400 MT/s NAND involved firmware updates and tuning to keep the controller within the PCIe M.2 power limit. Which brings us to the second part of this award.\nThe Phison E26 controller has been powering the fastest PCIe 5.0 drives of the past year, but the real innovation is set to arrive with the next generation E31 controller that will launch later this year. E26 is manufactured on TSMC's 12nm process, and the E31 will move to TSMC 7nm (N7). At that point, the combination of NAND and controller should effectively max out what we can expect to see from PCIe 5.0 drives \u2014 we'll need PCIe 6.0 to get significantly faster.\nPut another way, Phison is moving the entire high-performance consumer SSD market forward. Without Phison, we'd still be stuck with PCIe 4.0 drives for at least a few more months. We've had PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots on Z690 motherboards since 2021 and had to wait two years to get SSDs that would make use of the technology, and we have Phison to thank for that.\n\u2013 Jarred Walton\nBest Motherboard: ASRock Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning Wi-Fi\nASRock already owns most of the slots on our Best Motherboards page for current-gen chipsets, because the company has recently been delivering solid feature sets at comparatively low prices, while the rest of the industry seems content to churn out ever-more-expensive boards for the kinds of builders who still have $1,000 or more left over after buying the shiny new RTX 4080 Super.\nAnd the new Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning Wi-Fi, at just $200, looks to continue that trend for those looking to build a compact but powerful Mini-ITX with up to an Intel 14900K, thanks to 14+1+1 power phase setup, adorned with some chunky heatsinks.\nThe dual-DIMM setup that\u2019s typical of ITX boards should also make for top-speed RAM support. The only limiting factor here is that the board seems to only have a single PCIe 4.0 M.2 slot, although there could be another hiding on the back of the board. We hope to get this board in soon and run it through our benchmark suite. If it performs as expected, this will likely be an appealing motherboard for many gamers looking to build a powerful compact rig while spending most of their build budget on things like the GPU and CPU.\nRead More: ASRock's $200 Mini-ITX motherboard to support Intel Core i9-14900K\n\u2013 Matt Safford\nStay on the Cutting Edge\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "The Best Desktops and PC Components of CES 2024\nNew chips, new cards, new PC parts, new year! CES 2024 was an explosion of innovation from familiar faces AMD and Nvidia, plus some names you may not know. Here's the show-stopping stuff from the DIY sphere.\nI have been a technology journalist for almost 30 years and have covered just about every kind of computer gear\u2014from the 386SX to 64-core processors\u2014in my long tenure as an editor, a writer, and an advice columnist. For almost a quarter-century, I worked on the seminal, gigantic Computer Shopper magazine (and later, its digital counterpart), aka the phone book for PC buyers, and the nemesis of every postal delivery person. I was Computer Shopper's editor in chief for its final nine years, after which much of its digital content was folded into PCMag.com. I also served, briefly, as the editor in chief of the well-known hardcore tech site Tom's Hardware.\nSince the beginning, CES has been about computers. And, 57 shows later, that beating heart has persisted through wave after wave of consumer electronics trends\u2014even the recent push of electric vehicles into the annual event. This year, CES did not disappoint, with yet another gauntlet of computing innovations including impressive cooling solutions, hyper-compact gaming desktops, and supercharged graphics cards.\nIf you\u2019re looking for which desktop and component products topped everything we saw at the show, check out our broader Best of CES 2024 article. For a deeper cut into coolest desktop PC products and DIY gear we saw firsthand, though, keep on reading.\nBest Gaming Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the Asus ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel \"Meteor Lake\" processors (the options: the Core Ultra 7 155H or Core Ultra 9 185H), coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or a living-room PC with AAA-game capabilities. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and a range of ports. Given that the ROG NUC's parts and performance resemble those of gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring. \u2014Brian Westover, Lead Analyst\nBest Productivity Desktop\nASRock DeskMeet X600\nFrom the outside, the Ryzen-based DeskMeet is an unassuming black cube; that's why we've taken a couple of photos of it with its shell off. This compact PC features an unusual internal design that allows for an extraordinary amount of upgrade or configuration flexibility and some cutting-edge specs.\u00a0You can add 2.5-inch and 3.5-inch drives on one of two brackets, as well as a host of M.2 drives (including one PCI Express 5.0 drive!) on the top and bottom of the pre-installed motherboard. The board supports the latest AMD AM5 processors, so you can install one of these chips and employ its integrated graphics, though compact graphics cards will fit, too.\nThe chassis is just big enough for ATX power supplies, but the back-panel plating also supports smaller SFX models. Plus, the screw-mount design for the PSU makes it easy to slide out the PSU and expose the innards of the case for servicing or upgrades. ASRock showed it off packing a snub-nosed Radeon RX 7600 XT. Most surprising: The PC supports high-speed USB4 through a port on the front panel, from a connector mounted directly on the custom motherboard. \u2014John A. Burek, Executive Editor\nBest Graphics Card\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super graphics cards are a real game-changer. However, of all these card variants we saw at CES, none stood out more than the MSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert. Built like an even-more-premium version of Nvidia\u2019s classic Founders Edition cards (with a blower fan on each side), this new MSI card has prominent metal sections and stylish diagonal metal vents that make it look and feel like a luxury sports car of the GPU world. In addition to having more cores than the standard RTX 4080, the RTX 4080 Super also has faster GDDR6X memory and a lower price, though this top-tier model will likely cost a premium. \u2014Michael Sexton, Analyst\nBest Processor\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nAMD\u2019s Ryzen 7 8700G is designed for entry-level gaming performance and a powerful CPU in one convenient and cost-effective package. In its press release, AMD set the Ryzen 7 8700G against an entry-level graphics card, the Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650, and an Intel Core i5-13400F and claimed that the Ryzen 7 8700G without a graphics card will more often provide a superior gaming experience. We need to test the accuracy of this claim ourselves, but it seems plausible and exciting if true: It will make the cost of building an entry-level gaming PC lower than it\u2019s been for years, with the Ryzen 7 8700G itself costing just $329. \u2014M.S.\nBest Showcase PC Case\nThermaltake The Tower 300\nWe've tested several of Thermaltake's The Tower series of PC cases over the years, some big and some small, but we may like the 300 best of all. This Mini-ITX case stands tall and can take up to a 420mm radiator down the right side. The front glass panel is a three-piece prism shape with snap connectors, and the side panels attach and remove via neodymium magnets. You can get an optional front-face LCD kit to complement the case bottom, and an optional horizontal stand, paired with a replacement base, lets you lay the case down sideways on your desk with the glass interior angled up at you. Best of all, though,\u00a0are the color choices:\u00a0yellow (\"Bumblebee\"), Matcha Green, and Thermaltake's new signature Hydrangea Blue, which celebrates the company's 25th anniversary. \u2014J.A.B.\nBest Motherboard\nASRock Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning WiFi\nWhat's so special about a B760-chipset Mini-ITX motherboard? How about one that supports the highest-power and hottest-running Intel desktop processors? A muscled-up VRM cooling configuration, a 14+1+1 phase design, and a reduction in the depth of the I/O ports to accommodate more\u00a0robust power circuitry: All that together makes the B760I Lightning one of the few compact Intel LGA 1700 motherboards that's recommendable for use with high-end chips such as the Core i9-14900K.\u00a0Plus, this board is no slouch when it comes to other features, such built in Wi-Fi. \u2014J.A.B.\nBest Power Product\nEnermax PlatiGemini 1200W\nEnermax is known for its long warranties and use of 100% Japanese capacitors. This power supply's possible claim to fame, though, is different: With Intel's ATX12VO initiative in the air for the last couple of years, this power supply, a 1,200-watt model, straddles the line between present and a potential ATX12VO future, while also supporting the emerging ATX 3.1 standard and featuring 80 Plus Platinum support. This high-end PSU sports support for both the emerging ATX12VO 10-pin connector and the full 24-pin power connector used by the vast majority of modern boards. If you want some insurance while using today's standards in favor of tomorrow's possible ones, in a power supply that you're likely to keep through your next PC and maybe the one after that, the PlatiGemini is an intriguing option. \u2014J.A.B.\nBest Cooling Product\nXPG Hybrid Cooler\nThis two-fan cooler supports CPUs up to 280W TDP. The differentiator here, though, is that it's halfway between an AIO liquid cooler and a pure air model. The \"radiator\" is actually sandwiched between the two 120mm fans, and internal liquid circulates through the body of the cooler and through the top module, which is serviced by a small impeller-type mechanism inside.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nXPG says it should support all modern platforms, including even mighty HEDT ones like Intel Xeon and AMD Ryzen Threadripper Pro. It's designed to compete with top-end, big, \"pure\" air coolers from the likes of Noctua. \u2014J.A.B.\nBest New DIY Ecosystem\nCooler Master Mythril Open-Loop Series\nMythril is Cooler Master's ecosystem of a la carte liquid-cooling components, made to allow for easy, soup-to-nuts custom loop projects, fed by a variety of connectors, elbows, and distribution plates. What makes it extra-special, though, is the option to use square acrylic tubing, a departure from the usual round hoses or tubes.\nSpecially designed fittings allow you to easily connect and disconnect these square tubes (you can't screw in a square, of course!), and Cooler Master will sell a special tool for angle-bending square tubing. The lineup will also include a variety of colored coolants. \u2014J.A.B.\nBest Sustainable PC DIY Product\nIn Win POC One\nThink of the cardboard, the container volume, and the fuel required to ship what's essentially an empty box (which is to say, a PC case) across oceans. In Win has a clever solution for reducing all that: a foldable PC case. The company showed off its original POC case last year; it was a case that shipped in something resembling a pizza box, with sheets of metal that were bendable, origami-style, into a lightweight Mini-ITX chassis.\nConsider the new POC One (shown as a prototype at Computex 2023, and now preparing to ship) a premium version of the original. All-aluminum styling and rubber silicone hinges allow In Win to ship this Mini-ITX case packed flat. It's easy to fold it into shape and attach its included pop-down acrylic panel to the front face. The price will likely be in the low $200s, and the POC One will come in black or silver. \u2014J.A.B.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!

Front and center (well, actually, it\u2019s on the left) is an Android touchscreen, with access to the full Google Play store so you can download any of the best music streaming services to listen to in maximum quality via the twin high-end 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DAC, via THX AAA 788+ amplification, meaning this thing can power just about anything you want to connect to it, from hard-to-support headphones to rich speakers. The lid\u2019s E-Ink cover is constructed from many small, but not tiny, segments that can change color to create shapes and designs on the lid with almost no power (we\u2019re talking milliwatts here), but is still bright enough to be seen clearly from far away in a well-lit room, just the kind of thing you\u2019d want your team to be using at a major trade conference with a company logo or other form of marketing graphic on to build hype. Best gaming tech: MSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw is one of the most exciting devices of CES thanks to it being the first gaming handheld to be powered by Intel Core Ultra processors with integrated Intel Arc graphics (with the exciting prospect of hardware-accelerated resolution upscaling via Intel XeSS), but the chip itself is only half the story.\n",

Here\u2019s how it works.\n20 best gadgets of CES 2024: the top TVs, smart home tech, laptops and more we saw at the show\nFrom mind-blowing portable speakers to the return of the phone keyboard, here are our CES 2024 award winners\nWe're deep into CES 2024 now, and the TechRadar team has been prowling the halls looking for all the very best consumer tech at the show, and trying out as much of it as we can until security gets hardcore with us about the show closing for the day.\nOnce we'd seen as much as we could, we got everyone together to discuss the absolute best gadgets of CES 2024, ranging from new products that are being released imminently, to fantastic (but very real) prototypes that show a vision of the future that gets us excited about tech all over again.\nObviously, there being only 20 winners here means there are literally thousands of interesting and smart ideas at the show we didn't have space to include. We saw a ton of stuff we thought was seriously great, so be sure to read all our CES news for that \u2013 but these are the products that had the extra juice that got our team talking, and stood out as our Best of CES 2024 winners.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nOur TV of the show simply had to be the first set to make a transparent screen into something practical that you can actually imagine owning. Do we think this will deliver the best picture quality of any TV at CES? No, but that\u2019s not remotely the point. It pushes the art of the TV set to a new level, combining developments from LG\u2019s ground-breaking rollable TV with its unique wireless 4K HDR 120Hz streaming tech and, of course, a clear 4K OLED panel \u2013 all built into a piece of furniture that makes it a real lifestyle object.\nIt can show partially transparent video, or you can watch it like a normal TV with the full contrast you expect from OLED thanks to a contrast-boosting layer that automatically rises out of the base \u2013 plus there's powerful built-in sound, and no cable clutter thanks to the cutting-edge wireless connection box. It all adds up into something unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before in the best TVs.\nBest projector: Samsung The Premiere 8K\nSamsung\u2019s flagship projector for 2024, The Premiere 8K, is the world\u2019s first to support wireless 8K streaming, something it does using an included One Connect box with Wi-Fi 7 support (picture on the right in the image above). It can beam a 150-inch 8K image when positioned just 12 inches away from a screen, and its brightness is specified at an impressive 4,000 lumens, putting it in good company among the best projectors.\nThe Premiere 8K is also an all-in-one solution for home theater audio and gaming. It has a built-in 8.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system powered by 100 watts, and uses Sound-on-Screen tech to elevate audio from the projector up to the screen area for a more cinematic presentation. Like other Samsung projectors, it features the same smart TV interface found in the company\u2019s TVs for streaming, along with Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming. It's high-end tech in a very lifestyle-friendly package and design, and we're excited to see more of it.\nBest soundbar: Samsung HW-Q990D\nThe HW-Q990D is the successor to Samsung\u2019s HW-Q990C, which was already the best soundbar for anyone who wants easy but truly powerful and engrossing Dolby Atmos sound. With 22 speaker drivers and 11.1.4 channels, it\u2019s a go-to option for complete Dolby Atmos immersion, and this year Samsung has added 4K 120Hz pass-through to its HDMI ports, fixing the only minor flaw that we found with its predecessor.\nWhen paired with a compatible Samsung TV, the Q990C can receive Dolby Atmos signals wirelessly. It also supports Samsung\u2019s new Active Voice Pro feature, which uses AI to dynamically highlight voices in a movie\u2019s audio mix and elevate them for those movies where you struggle to hear what's going on. Which will be especially welcome when the soundtrack is as powerful and hard-hitting as this soundbar is capable of being, from our time with it on the show floor.\nBest speaker: Brane X\nSometimes at CES, you know the instant you try a product that you\u2019re seeing something that changes your expectations for a type of product. The Brane X is that for the best wireless speakers. It\u2019s a portable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth speaker that has a real, bona fide subwoofer in there. Not a bass port, not a woofer \u2013 a subwoofer that\u2019s the equivalent of an eight-inch sub like you'd find in a soundbar\u2019s separate subwoofer unit. You can see the air vents for it on the right side of the picture above \u2013 it covers the whole bottom of the unit.\nThe difference is absolutely astounding; powerful bass in music that you can feel in your diaphragm for tracks that load up on it, or just a much fuller and richer sound to acoustic instruments that covers a broader, and so more realistic, audio range \u2013 all from something the size of a six-pack. It uses a unique subwoofer design to make this happen, and combined with four other drivers, you get the best, most fulsome sound I\u2019ve heard from any speaker that isn\u2019t a floorstander. It\u2019s launching imminently in the US for $599, and music fans with limited space absolutely must take notice. Not that you\u2019d be able to avoid noticing one if it were playing in front of you.\nBest headphones: Sennheiser Momentum 4 True Wireless\nSennheiser has jumped on the latest generations of Bluetooth tech with its latest wireless earbuds, adding Qualcomm's new chip with Snapdragon Sound for CD-quality audio if you have a compatible phone, but they're also ready for the future of regular Bluetooth with support for Bluetooth 5.4 and LE Audio and Auracast.\nMost importantly, as you'd expect from Sennheiser, we've found they deliver superb audio quality and strong adaptive noise cancellation from what we could tell in our time with them, and still with a long battery life of 7.5 hours in the buds (though we couldn't test that yet). Sennheiser says they're also very low-latency, so will be a step up for gamers.\nWe like the design too, with a shiny finish that nods at jewelry, and a fabric case that follows Sennheiser's other designs. It seems clear that we have a big contender for our list of the best wireless earbuds here.\nBest music player: Fiio R9\nThis all-in-one music system for the streaming world is the ultimate hub however you like to listen, and a great-looking object to have in your home to boot. Front and center (well, actually, it\u2019s on the left) is an Android touchscreen, with access to the full Google Play store so you can download any of the best music streaming services to listen to in maximum quality via the twin high-end 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DAC, via THX AAA 788+ amplification, meaning this thing can power just about anything you want to connect to it, from hard-to-support headphones to rich speakers. But in a nice touch, if you don\u2019t want to sign up to Google, Fiio has added its own app store with major music services on board, no login required.\nThe box can handle basically any kind of digital file you could want to throw at it, from PCM 768kHz/32-Bit to DSD512 to MQA, and it even has two kinds of HDMI connection (ARC and straight audio, for SACD/DVD-Audio fans) and it sounds absolutely fantastic. We listened with Fiio\u2019s new FT5 planar magnetic headphones, and there\u2019s so much power and poise and dynamic range, all in a sleek metal design with light-up dials. For those who want the feeling of a huge music system and library in a compact space, this is irresistible.\nBest laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook 13x Gen 4 SPE\nLenovo has been experimenting with E-Ink laptop covers for a few years now, and the Lenovo ThinkBook 13x Gen 4 SPE concept laptop seems like the natural evolution of its work to date. Even more though, it feels like we can finally see the point of having an E-Ink cover at all.\nThe E-Ink Prism technology built into the lid of the laptop enables you to create a color design on your laptop lid that isn\u2019t just a picture, but can feature animation that brings unparalleled personalization to your device in a way a simple sticker or case on the best laptops never could.\nIt\u2019s not as simple as uploading a PNG, however. The lid\u2019s E-Ink cover is constructed from many small, but not tiny, segments that can change color to create shapes and designs on the lid with almost no power (we\u2019re talking milliwatts here), but is still bright enough to be seen clearly from far away in a well-lit room, just the kind of thing you\u2019d want your team to be using at a major trade conference with a company logo or other form of marketing graphic on to build hype. For the rest of us, we can still absolutely make the device our own \u2013 Lenovo's breathed new life into laptop design with this version of the tech.\nBest computing component: AMD Ryzen 8040 Series\nThe Ryzen 8040-series CPUs that AMD announced at CES 2024 are more than just Team Red\u2019s answer to Intel\u2019s Meteor Lake mobile processors, if AMD\u2019s published benchmarks are right, it might be the AI chip to have in the best laptops next year, such as the new Razer Blade 14 pictured above, which includes the new platform.\nAccording to AMD, the new Ryzen 8040 series processors aren\u2019t just competitive with Intel\u2019s newest mobile silicon, they outpace them across a wide array of workloads from gaming to the latest generative AI tools such as Stable Diffusion.\nOf course, AMD is going to cherry pick its best results if it can, but if its numbers are accurate, these mobile processors can go a long way to eating into Intel\u2019s absolutely dominant position in the mobile laptop market, and give people a real reason to switch over from Team Blue.\nBest gaming tech: MSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw is one of the most exciting devices of CES thanks to it being the first gaming handheld to be powered by Intel Core Ultra processors with integrated Intel Arc graphics (with the exciting prospect of hardware-accelerated resolution upscaling via Intel XeSS), but the chip itself is only half the story.\nMSI has a long pedigree for gaming hardware, and its new device is a stunning handheld in its own right. The 1080p display is incredibly crisp thanks to its wide color coverage and speedy refresh rate, while the 16GB LPDDR5 RAM and up to 1TB NVMe SSD storage will help make managing your game library on the go a lot less painful. We were impressed with the whole device in our MSI Claw hands-on, and we can't wait to get deeper into using it.\nBest computing accessory: Razer Project Esther\nRazer Project Esther is the iconic peripherals brand\u2019s latest take on a fairly old and often repetitive gaming technology that has always offered the promise of deeper immersion, but never really truly gotten there. While there are seams in the Project Esther\u2019s Sensa HD Haptic technology, they are extremely tight, and the overall experience this chair cushion provides is difficult-to-describe (though I certainly tried in a hands-on preview of Project Esther earlier this week).\nThe long and short of what makes this cushion so different is that while many haptic products promise more immersive gaming, Project Esther comes way closer to what most people are hoping for than any competing product on the market thanks to its directional HD haptics. The closest analogue to this would be Dolby Atmos, but for haptics \u2013 and with a software development kit for game developers to fine-tune the haptic experience of their games, this device is one of the few products of this kind that gamers are really going to want if it goes on-sale.\nBest mobile accessory: Clicks Keyboard\nThe question isn't whether you need Clicks, the premium new keyboard that attaches to the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro. The question is why aren't there more keyboards for smartphones already? If you write a lot of messages, or even if you just write captions for your favorite photos and videos, Clicks gives you a smart new way to type that frees up a ton of screen space.\nIt's pricey at $139, but it feels like a premium keyboard for your Pro-level iPhone. It's got a backlight, and it comes in a staid London Blue or smiley-faced Bumblebee yellow that will attract glances from curious keyboard newbs and old school BlackBerry fans alike. We've never done more writing on our phones, and Clicks strongly makes the case that physical keys are due a comeback.\nBest smart home innovation: Nanoleaf Orchestrator\nNanoleaf's Orchestrator software is a massive improvement upon the smart lighting company's existing Rhythm tool, taking music visualization to new heights. Not only does it interpret the beat and melodies into color palettes and motions (and allow for personalization, too), but you can even group your devices into different parts of the tracks, too.\nWhere Rhythm uses on-device built-in microphones to detect sound, Orchestrator picks apart music played through your laptop or PC, identifying the mood and layers of a track to create a gorgeous complimentary light show. The only software we've tried that comes close is Philips Hue's, but that's exclusive to Spotify and way less customizable.\nAs of writing, it's only available on the Nanoleaf Desktop App, but we'd be very surprised if a mobile equivalent didn't roll out within the next year or two. The fun this can add to your smart lighting setup can't be underestimated\nBest small appliance: Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo\nWhile the robot vacuum and mop part of this product itself isn't brand new at CES, having released late last year, this new edition of the Deebot X2 is pretty special and novel; it features a connected handheld vacuum (or one with a handle), which also auto-empties itself into the same vacuum bag as the robot vacuum when you dock it. The space-saving potential is excellent, but more than that, the vacuum is pretty accomplished, too.\nThe Deebot X2 robot vacuum is square-shaped, optimized for better wall-to-wall and corner cleaning, and sporting a gorgeous, minimalist design. Plus, thanks to the Matter 1.2 rollout, the bot is now Matter-compatible, though it also supports Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri Shortcuts natively, as well as its own Yiko 2.0 voice control.\nIt's just a great pairing that brings a feature that's been a recent and extremely convenient feature of the best robot vacuums (the self-emptying tool) to the world of the best cordless vacuums. When you've finished, you just pop it back to charge and you don't need to think about the dust. We love it.\nBest wellness tech: Baracoda BMind\nThe BMind smart mirror is a glimpse into the bathrooms of the future. Powered by generative AI and Natural Language Processing, it offers personalized recommendations based on the user's mental state, all controlled by a combination of gesture and voice commands. It can do things like detect that you look sad, and ask you how your day is going, and make changes based on your response.\nFor example, you can say that you're feeling sad or down, and it will use light therapy techniques, changing its LED light output in a way that can help to improve your mood. It also has mindfulness exercises such as guided meditation built in that it can suggest and run too \u2013 all provided through the CareOS interface and programs from ThrivePal. Its built-in camera has face detection so everything is personalized for you (and kept only to you).\nIt can also help in more physical ways, with guided toothbrushing coaching, and skin analysis, so it can make recommendations for how to, say, reduce redness in your face. If it works as well as BMind says, it could be a much more convenient way to get help and advice than by reaching for your phone and it'll be more personalized.\nBest wearable: Evie Smart Ring\nNot only is Evie a rare gem among health devices at CES, in that it will actually launch, but it's also a wearable device that puts women first in all the best ways.\nFrom its gorgeous, open design that accommodates the natural fluctuations in a woman's body over the course of the month, to its intelligent application and AI insights engine, Evie's all about putting women's health center-stage in an industry where it's often an afterthought.\nBest of all, it's completely subscription free, meaning you can enjoy its medical-grade sleep, blood oxygen, heart health detection and menstrual data insights without worrying about the on-going cost. This looks like a great rival to the best smart rings.\nBest health tech: Withings BeamO\nThe idea of a do-it-all, handheld medical diagnostic devices is not new; fans of Star Trek well remember Dr. McCoy\u2019s Tricorder. Withings' BeamO is not quite that, but may be an exciting baby step in the right direction. It\u2019s a lightweight, compact, all-in-one device that can run ECG, blood oxygen, temperature and even stethoscope tests.\nYou don\u2019t wave BeamO in front of a body to detect trouble. Instead, you\u2019ll place BeamO against your temple or chest (or hold the sensors on it for SPO2 and ECG readings). The exciting thing is that whatever data it collects can instantly be shared with your healthcare professional who will know how to read your health stats.\nBest outdoor tech: Swarovski Ax Visio\nHigh-end binoculars with a digital camera built-in so that you can capture what you're looking at are nothing new. High-end binoculars with a digital camera and AI recognition software that can tell you what you're looking at? That's new, and extremely cool. The neural processing unit in these binoculars is similar to what you get in the latest phones, and has been trained to identify 9,000 species of birds, so you no longer need to refer to a book or call your twitching uncle to discover what was hanging out on that cliff.\nSimply take a look through them like any other binoculars to find something interesting, and when you see a mystery bird, press a button on the side that will show a red circle in your vision. Get your bird into this circle, and its name will appear underneath. It's the ideal use of this kind of technology, and a perfectly futuristic upgrade to the most old-school of products.\nBest yard tech: Weber Summit Grill\nWeber makes some of the most effective grills and smokers you can buy, and now the company is offering one of the most advanced with the Weber Summit Smart Grill. This is for aspiring or accomplished chefs, as the featureset could cater a serious party. Besides the six burners, the infrared element up top, and the rotisserie spit, you get a digital PID controller that truly represents the next generation of grilling. It monitors everything, from the flame activity to the temperature to the gas levels, and gives you helpful feedback where to place your food for the best direct and indirect heat cooking.\nThe Weber Summit grill includes remarkable safety features that check the fire constantly, and even though it looks like a fancy computer, it can handle the same extreme heat and cold weather that you'd expect from any Weber grill, so it's not more delicate just because it's smarter. This will turn anyone in a true grilling pro.\nBest science tech: Celestron Origin\nAmateur astronomers dream of powerful telescopes and long warm nights of star gazing. The reality is the best time for star gazing is in the winter, and most telescopes are exercises in frustration. Smart telescopes bridge the gap between our stargazing wishes and the ability to carry them out, and Celestron Origin takes the concept to the next level.\nIt does all the hard work of finding celestial bodies, and will let you schedule when you want it to find and capture imagery of the planets, stars, and galaxies. Better yet, you can do it all from the warmth and comfort of your living room couch, using an iPad or your Phone. Want to see what it captured? It\u2019ll show up on your screen and you can cast it to your living room TV. This is the kind of armchair astronomy we can get behind.\nBest car tech: BMW Augmented Reality Ride Concept\nYou wouldn\u2019t think augmented reality and driving would go perfect together, and yet BMW showed me how wearing Xreal Air 2 glasses inside a beautiful EV BMW would somehow feel natural and even useful. The concept is simple: Xreal\u2019s glasses integrate with your phone, which is connected to the car to deliver real-time AR imagery that can tell you things about your trip that you might otherwise miss or have to glance down at a screen to see. Think direction, hazards, and indications that you\u2019re veering into the other lane, and you get the idea. The concept even extends to your passengers, who could, with their own glasses, turn any car surface into a screen for bingeing on the road.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens.

At CES 2024, we can expect to see everything from TVs to laptops, from smartphones to smart tractors. Basically if it runs off of electricity, it'll be at the show.\nCES 2024 technically starts tomorrow, but there have already been a ton of announcements, and the week is just getting started. We're live on the show floor, though, and we'll continue to update this article each day with the latest CES 2024 announcements.. Not everything will actually come to market, but we will get a pretty good idea what products will look like over the next year or so.\nCES 2024: When Is It Happening?\nCES 2024 kicks off on January 9, but CES Unveiled, the press conference that highlights the major trends at the show, happens on January 7 at 5PM PST (8PM EST). However, unlike many other trade shows which are all about the main keynote, CES is a more prolonged beast. Tech manufacturers from all over the world will have their own keynotes, or will just have gadgets on the show floor to show off.\nThis is why it's a good idea to stay tuned to IGN, as we'll be keeping our eyes open for the strange new technology that is scattered around the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nWhat is CES?\nCES stands for the Consumer Electronics Show, an annual industry-only tradeshow that features all the newest technology coming to market over the next couple of years. The show isn't really meant to show new products per se, but rather the tech and trends that are going to be powering the new products.\nEverything Announced at CES 2024 So Far\nNvidia Launches Super-Powered Graphics Cards\nNvidia has announced three new graphics cards, the GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super, replacing the RTX 4080, 4070 Ti and 4070, respectively. This is a classic mid-generation refresh looking to convince more folks to upgrade their PCs. The first of these cards to hit the market will be the GeForce RTX 4070 Super, which comes out on January 17, but don't worry, all three will be out by the end of the month.\nMSI Is Here to Claw Some of the Handheld Gaming PC Market From Asus and Valve\nThe best handheld gaming PCs are here to stay, and the latest is the MSI Claw. Rather than being powered by the AMD Z1 chip, like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally, the Claw is powered by the new Intel Core Ultra processor, backed by Intel Arc graphics. Onboard graphics are usually a bad word when it comes to PC gaming, but this time around both Intel and MSI seem confident in what this chip can do. I know I'm excited to put it through its paces, and see how it compares to the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally.\nApple Swoops In With a Surprise Vision Pro Announcement\nWhile Apple technically isn't here in Las Vegas for CES, the Cupertino giant did take some of the spotlight when it suddenly announced a release date for the Apple Vision Pro, the company's take on a VR/AR headset. Preorders for the headset go live January 19th, and it will officially hit the market on February 2. That's not much longer to wait for a product that we thought was going to keep getting pushed back. Let's just hope it's worth that $3,499 price tag.\nSony and Honda Drive Cars With a DualSense Controller\nSony and Honda teamed up at CES to show off the Honda Afeela driven with a Sony DualSense controller. That's exciting for sure, but it's important to keep in mind that this is just a tech demo and not something that is guaranteed to come to market. And, honestly, it's probably safe to assume it will, at least any time soon. Doesn't stop it from looking cool as hell, though.\nWhat To Expect From CES 2024\nTL;DR: Here's What to Expect\nIt's hard to even think about CES 2024 without bringing up AI. Not only have AI-based language models like Chat GPT been the center of conversation all year, but both Intel and AMD have announced new processors that'll have silicon dedicated to AI workloads. Couple that with the fact Apple has had a Neural Engine built into its processors since the M1 hit the market in 2020 means that LLMs (language learning models) and AI-based image generation are going to be processed locally on the best laptops, rather than in the cloud.\nDon't worry, gaming is totally going to be affected by this too. Ever since the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 in 2019, Nvidia's graphics cards have shipped with Tensor Cores which are purpose-built to handle machine learning workloads. This is the hardware behind the hugely-successful DLSS, or Deep-Learning Super Sampling. So, you can expect Nvidia to show up in Vegas to show off what's coming next for their own special AI upscaling secret sauce.\n2023 has also been huge for handheld gaming. The Steam Deck OLED, Lenovo Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally have all made waves for basically being a Nintendo Switch that can run all your favorite Steam games on the go. However, all of these systems are basically using the same AMD Z1 chipset. It'd be nice to see AMD come out with a new chipset that can show off the next generation of handheld gaming. Or, even better, if Nvidia or Intel came out with something similar that can introduce some competition to that space.\nBeyond gaming, we're likely to hear something from smartwatch manufacturers, especially after Apple announced it would stop selling its flagship smartwatches, according to a report from 9to5Mac. This comes via a lawsuit around Apple using imported blood oxygen level-monitoring technology. So, either we're going to see a new company take on this challenge or we're going to at least hear some kind of discussion about how best to move forward.\nCES 2024 is going to be full of surprises too. Every year the LVCC show floor is packed with inventive little gadgets that really push the boundaries of what's possible with technology. So, be sure to keep this page bookmarked, as we'll keep it updated with the coolest tech CES 2024 has to offer.\nIGNRecommends"

        "raw_content": "The Coolest PC Tech From CES 2024\nLast week's CES 2024 resulted in a flurry of products announcements and new tech reveals, not least among them a slew of new PC peripherals and the debut of Nvidia's Super 40 Series GPUs. Not everything deemed worthy of showcase at CES is all that exciting, and some things definitely left me a bit more impressed than others.\nNow that the dust of the show has settled for another year, and to celebrate some of the coolest PC tech showcased at CES 2024, let's take a look at three of my favorite announcements.\nThe ROG NUC gaming PC\nAt this point, giant gaming rigs have been the go-to for PC gamers for years, but that has slowly been changing as more and more smaller builds make their way to the market. One of the coolest to make an appearance at CES 2024 this year is the ROG NUC gaming PC.\nThis little box is a mini-PC equipped with your choice of an Intel Core Ultra 9, Core Ultra 7, and a Nvidia RTX 4060 or 4070 GPU. You can also configure it with up to 32GB of RAM, which means you could replace your giant gaming rig with a solid machine that takes up a fraction of the space.\nNvidia RTX 40 Super series GPUs\nOf course, I can't talk about great PC stuff from CES without touching on the debut of the new Nvidia RTX 40 Super series GPUs. These next-gen GPUs offer minor improvements over the original 4070, 4070 Ti, and 4080 cards, but they come at a much more affordable price. The new RTX 4070 super improves Nvidia's already great midrange GPU option while offering a similar price.\nASUS BTF ecosystem\nASUS didn't stop at a new ROG gaming PC option. The company is also trying to make the lives of PC builders\u2014both pros and newbies alike\u2014much easier with its BTF (back to the future) component ecosystem. This ecosystem includes specially designed cases, motherboards, and even graphics cards designed to make cable management much easier by allowing you to hide the cables behind the motherboard instead of in front of it.\nIt's an intriguing system that has me excited at the prospect of building a new PC with these components, and I'm hyped to see what ASUS does with the BTF ecosystem going forward.\nThe honorable mentions\nThere were tons of other cool and/or wacky things on display at CES 2024, including the MSI Claw and the upcoming HP Transcend 32. The latter brings an impressive display and KVM support to your desk in a large 32-inch monitor, and while I won't go into details on the Claw too much here, but fellow Lifehacker writer Pranay Parab talks about it more in-depth in his guide to the coolest and weirdest gaming gear we saw at CES 2024.\nJosh Hawkins has been writing about science, gaming, and tech culture for over a decade.

This is still a solid step in the right direction, however, and its sets Nvidia up to remain at the top of the GPU heap until we finally get a taste of Blackwell.\n The problem with the thermal shelf is the extra size it adds to the footprint of the laptop.

        "raw_content": "The best PC hardware we saw at CES 2024\nAMD, Nvidia, and Intel all came out swinging at CES 2024, laying the foundation for PC hardware announcements before other brands piled on. We saw a ton of great PC hardware this year, but only a handful of parts rose above the rest.\nAfter spending several days scouring convention halls, we put together this list of the most impressive PC hardware we saw at CES 2024.\nNvidia RTX 40-series Super\nNvidia did everything I wanted with the RTX 40-series Super refresh. The poor-value RTX 4080 is now a high-end champ at $1,000, the RTX 4070 Ti feels like a proper $800 GPU with its AD103 treatment, and the RTX 4070 Super improves on the already compelling midrange GPU, offering up a big jump in performance for the same price.\nGamers have given Nvidia a lot of flak this generation, and for good reason. It\u2019s been the driving force behind higher GPU prices, mainly on the back of the RTX 4080, RTX 4070 Ti, and RTX 4070. This Super refresh feels like a course correction. It\u2019s Nvidia recognizing it pushed prices too far by bumping specs or cutting prices in the places where it matters.\nMy main hope is that we see some other GPUs get the Super treatment, particularly the notorious RTX 4060 Ti and the solid, if unimpressive RTX 4060. This is still a solid step in the right direction, however, and its sets Nvidia up to remain at the top of the GPU heap until we finally get a taste of Blackwell.\nAMD RX 7600 XT\nWe all knew it was coming. The RX 7600 XT just makes sense considering every single one of AMD\u2019s current-gen GPUs received the XT branding except the RX 7600. Although there was some speculation that AMD would refresh its lineup to compete with Nvidia\u2019s Super refresh, AMD decided to play in a price range that Nvidia isn\u2019t touching.\nAt $330, the RX 7600 XT is positioned in an interesting spot. It\u2019s more expensive than the RTX 4060, though there\u2019s a good chance it will be faster, and it undercuts the RTX 4060 Ti by a significant margin. Perhaps the most significant thing about the RX 7600 XT is that it comes with 16GB of VRAM, reaffirming AMD\u2019s drive for high capacities of memory on cheaper GPUs.\nThat 16GB is still squeezed through a 128-bit bus, however, and the underlying GPU is the same on both the RX 7600 XT and RX 7600. AMD is claiming some large performance improvements, however, so we\u2019ll have to wait until we\u2019ve tested the GPU to see how it holds up.\nMSI Claw\nIs a handheld PC hardware? I don\u2019t care \u2014 this is my list! It\u2019s been a foregone conclusion that we\u2019d see the major laptop brands all release a handheld gaming PC at some point after the introduction of the ROG Ally, but the MSI Claw actually manages to do something different. It\u2019s the first time we\u2019re seeing Intel\u2019s Meteor Lake platform on a handheld.\nThat might not seem significant, but the MSI Claw is a representation of how Intel\u2019s approach to decoupling the different elements on the system on a chip can lead to new, exciting form factors. It also introduces Intel\u2019s XeSS to handhelds, providing some much-need AI supersampling to aid in running demanding games.\nMSI doesn\u2019t have the software nailed yet, and I\u2019m still partial to the Steam Deck in terms of comfort. But the MSI Claw is an exciting step for handheld gaming PCs, with Intel finally entering the fray and providing PC gamers on the go with more options to play.\nHyte Keeb TKL\nIt\u2019s really hard for a keyboard to stand out, but the Hyte Keeb TKL does nothing but stand out. It\u2019s one of the most unique keyboards I\u2019ve ever seen, and it certainly left an impression at CES 2024. The main draw is the transparent frame, which Hyte stuffs full of RGB LEDs. These illuminate the body of the keyboard, making it appear as though you\u2019re typing on a cloud of RGB light.\nIt looks stunning, but the Keeb has more than looks going for it. This keyboard uses a gasket mount along with four layers of sound dampening internally. The result is an endlessly satisfying keyboard to type on, one which can hang with some of the more high-end enthusiast options on the market.\nHyte packed in other goodies as well, including a dual-mode volume wheel and a unique feel for the dedicated media keys. What stands out most is the price, however. At $180, the Hyte Keeb TKL is extremely competitive with enthusiast-grade keyboards, and it doesn\u2019t sacrifice much sound or feel in the process.\nAMD Ryzen 8000G\nBudget gamers should be thrilled that APUs are officially back. AMD introduced its Ryzen 8000G CPUs at CES this year, which combine not only up to eight Zen 4 CPU cores, but also up to a Radeon 780M mobile graphics chip. This is the same graphics chip we\u2019ve seen at work in handhelds like the Asus ROG Ally, but with more power available to it, AMD says it can run even faster.\nIn real-world use, AMD says the top Ryzen 8000G CPU can hit 60 frames per second (fps) at 1080p in demanding games like\u00a0Alan Wake 2\u00a0and\u00a0Cyberpunk 2077.\u00a0That\u2019s with lowered graphics settings, but that\u2019s still seriously impressive performance for a PC without a dedicated graphics card.\nEven more impressive is the price. The top chip runs $330, with the other options getting cheaper from there. That vastly lowers the barrier to entry for PC gaming. AMD has sat out on powerful APUs for the last few years, and the Ryzen 8000G processors are a resounding return to form.\nThe Alienware 34 QD-OLED took the world by storm. As the first really great OLED gaming monitor, it had little in the way of competition.\nBut in 2024, that's not true. And to keep its lead, Alienware has launched two new QD-OLED gaming monitors that take things even further. There is now a 32-inch 4K model (AW3225QF) and a 27-inch QHD model (AW2725DF), both of which use the second-generation QD-OLED tech from Samsung Display. I got to see both models in person at a preview event ahead of CES 2024, and I came away extremely excited for these new gaming monitors.\nFinally, there are some creator laptops that can actually match the MacBook Pro.\nThere are tons of powerful options for gaming laptops out there that sport the most powerful GPUs and the most high-end displays. But none are true MacBook Pro competitors for content creators and creative professionals. MSI brought a couple of laptops to CES 2024 that might do the trick, though.\nThe Alienware m16 is only on its second generation, but the company is already hitting the reset button on the design. The m16 R2, announced at CES 2024, has both a redesigned chassis and reengineered thermals, plus one very notable feature never seen in an Alienware gaming laptop.\nMost Alienware laptops have proudly featured a \"thermal shelf\" on the back, which purportedly helped with air ventilation and positioned the ports out of the way. The problem with the thermal shelf is the extra size it adds to the footprint of the laptop. It also adds a rather large bottom chin and hinge under the screen -- and sometimes results in a small palm rest and touchpad.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 day 3: the 9 best gadgets we've seen, from the LG C4 OLED to neural headphones\nOur highlights from another eventful day at CES 2024\nIt may already be day three of CES 2024, but the tech announcements show no sign of slowing down \u2013 in fact, after hours of scouring the show floor, we're discovering more hidden gems than ever after the big keynote announcements earlier this week.\nWe've already rounded up the best smart home tech of CES 2024 and the best wearable and fitness tech from the show, but what about some of our more left-field findings? You'll find some of the best ones below, including one of the best bits if AI hardware so far, some fascinating neural headphones and a wearable oven (yes, really).\nIt hasn't all been tech eccentricities, though, because we've also found time to get eyes-on with the LG C4 OLED TV (spoiler: it'll probably be one of 2024's best TVs) and a promisingly affordable 100-inch screen from Hisense. All via a smart, eco-friendly hairdryer from Loreal, of course.\nFor a quick blast of some of the most intriguing tech of the year, read on for all of our highlights from day three of CES 2024.\n1. LG C4 OLED TV\nTransparent OLED TVs may be all the rage at CES 2024, but the ones we're actually going to buy are more like the new LG C4 OLED \u2013 and our eyes-on time with it suggests the C4 going to be one to watch (quite literally) again this year.\nLG claimed in its CES announcement that the LG C4 would be brighter than last year's LG C3, despite using the same OLED panel. We were a little dubious, but our brief time with the set (which you can read more about in our hands-on LG C4 review confirmed) confirmed that its brightness boost is indeed very real.\nCombine this with processing improvements, including the addition of\u00a0LG's lossless wireless Dolby Atmos sound, and you have a TV that we can't wait to get in for proper testing this year to see how it compares to the best OLED TVs.\n2. Rabbit R1\nSmartphones have now devoured most handheld gadgets, but a new AI-powered one is making waves at CES 2024. The Rabbit R1 is the first genuinely interesting bit of AI hardware (more so than the strange Humane AI Pin) that we've seen since the ChatGPT explosion started just over a year ago \u2013 and it might be a glimpse of next-gen voice assistants.\nWhat does the Rabbit R1 do? We'd recommend watching the R1 launch video (which was clearly influenced by the original iPhone launch) for a longer explanation, but it's essentially a tool for talking to your favorite apps using natural language. Rather than swiping between different phone apps, you create 'rabbits' that can carry out tasks \u2013 like booking a flight or doing your shopping\u00a0\u2013 using your voice commands.\nWe doubt very much that the R1 will be replacing smartphones, but it does have a point about today's archaic app-swiping experience \u2013\u00a0and it's a solid blueprint for how a next-gen Siri or Google Assistant might use AI.\n3. Amazfit Helio Ring\nWe're still waiting for the long-rumored Samsung Galaxy Ring, but in the meantime Amazfit has announced another contender for the title of best smart ring at CES 2024 called the Helio Ring.\nLike the Oura Ring, Amazfit's rival promises to serve up detailed sleep tracking and recovery stats from your workouts. You'll seemingly be able to take the Helio Ring swimming or in downpours too, as it's water-resistant to 100m. And like the best Garmin watches, it'll also give you a daily Readiness score based based on your exertions and sleep.\nWe don't yet have a price or release date for the Helio Ring yet \u2013\u00a0and you will unfortunately need a monthly subscription to unlock all of its features \u2013\u00a0but it's one we're very keen to try out later this year.\n4. Neural headphones\nRather than a single product, neural headphones are instead a fascinating new tech genre that we've seen several examples of at CES 2024. By tapping into auditory nerves, these cans can effectively read your mind, giving you hands-free control of your tech or boosting your ability to relax.\nWe checked out four examples of neural headphones at CES and all of them bring their own spin on the concept. The Naqi Neural Earbuds, for example, were developed as an alternative to brain implants, and give you control over your Windows or Mac computer. The NeurGear ZenBuds, meanwhile, stimulate your Vagus nerve to trigger a rest response.\nWith other examples like the Earable Neuroscience Frenz Brainband ($490, ships in February 2024) planning to help us fall and stay asleep, it's definitely a big tech trend to watch this year.\n5. Kohler Anthem Plus\nThe shower might be last place that you want to be colonized by tech, but our time with Kohler's Anthem Plus Digital Control has convinced us of the benefits of 'digital showering'.\nThis touch-sensitive controller pairs with a digital thermostatic valve to give you a gloriously multi-sensory showering experience that lets you customize the water, light, sound, and even the\u00a0steam. It isn't cheap, starting at $2,800 (around \u00a32,200 / AU$4,180), but you could probably start charging visitors for showers.\n6. Hisense 110UX ULED TV\nYou can't call it a day at CES without seeing some truly massive TVs and Hisense didn't disappoint us on day three of the show, showing us its mini-LED lineup for 2024 \u2013\u00a0include a 110in whopper.\nThe 110UX is shaping up to be an impressive set all round, despite its size, with 40,000 local dimming zones and a scorching 10,000 nits brightness. On the audio front, you also get a built-in 4.2.2-channel speaker system that's bolstered by the new Dolby Atmos FlexConnect wireless audio tech.\nBut if you've measured up and don't quite have room for a 110-inch TV, Hisense will also be launching 100-inch regular QLED model in 2024 \u2013\u00a0and if history is any guide, that model will be impressively affordable for its size.\n7. Willtex Willcook wearable oven\nOne of the phrases we didn't expect to encounter today was 'wearable oven', but CES has a habit of surprising us \u2013\u00a0and sure enough, we found ourselves on the show floor trying a backpack that can cook food.\nOkay, the Willcook isn't an oven in the traditional sense, but it does have a thin mesh fabric that its maker calls an \"embedded heat ray.\" After putting our hand inside, we can attest \u2013 this thing does get hot enough to slow-cook food (even meat, fish and curry) while you're on the move.\nThe idea is that you could cook dinner while on the way back from work or while you're on-the-go on a camping trip. We reckon the tech might have better applications in a winter coat (which was another prototype that Willtex showed us), but the wearable oven will go on sale in the US in September for around $200.\n8. Bluetooth Auracast\nIf you don't know much about Bluetooth Auracast, you can expect to hear a lot more about it in 2024. The wireless tech \u2013\u00a0which means your compatible wireless headphones aren't just limited to the devices you're paired with \u2013\u00a0is starting to roll out on everything from portable speakers like the JBL Clip 5 to Samsung's 4K TVs and earbuds.\nBut our demo showed us some practical applications that we're excited about. For example, you could be in a sports bar watching a TV that you could tune into without needing to do any pairing. Or you could be in an airport getting departure announcements beamed straight to your ears so you don't miss the last call.\nIn future, Auracast should also let you tune into two streams at once, letting you watch a TV while still getting the airport gate announcements when they're made. We'll need more devices to support it, but Auracast could change the way we use headphones.\n9. L'Oreal AirLight Pro\nHow smart can a hairdryer really get? Well, if you've been eyeing up the Dyson Supersonic, you'll definitely be interested in the Loreal AirLight Pro. It combines a bunch of impressive tech advances that make it both super-efficient and eco-friendly, and also smart enough to please your inner gadget fan.\nThat efficiency, which apparently allows the Airlight Pro to use 30% less power than a traditional hair dryer, comes from its combination of air and infrared heating elements, which make it a bit like drying your hair in the sun and wind. Impressively, it can also recognize attachments and then adjust settings based on which one you've fitted.\nNaturally, the Airlight Pro is also app-connected (for Android and iOS devices), which lets you make further tweaks and customs settings on your phone. Read our hands-on report below, which might just convince you that Loreal's hairdryer is worth the roughly $400 (about \u00a3315) that it'll cost when it goes on sale in June (in Europe) and in the US before the end of 2024.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens.
