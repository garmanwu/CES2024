Though AI was mainly represented in\u00a0chatbots\u00a0in the past year, companies are now finding more innovative ways to incorporate the technology into hardware, including everything from futuristic robots to laptops to products that would have never been possible before.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWith so many AI-related announcements at CES this year, it can be difficult to distinguish between what's simple AI-washing and what's actual visionary technology. To help you understand what's most important, I've created a roundup of the AI and robots that have distinguished themselves from the rest based on factors such as helpfulness, uniqueness, and real-world applications.\nWith two press days and two event days down, I have seen a majority of what CES has to offer, including A LOT of product demos. To find out what my top picks for the best AI-infused products at CES are, keep reading. Also, most of my picks also happen to have won CES 2024 Innovation Awards, showing just how good these devices are.\n1. Motion Pillow\nThe Motion Pillow uses AI to help tackle snoring problems and give you a better night's sleep. The AI Motion System detects a user's snoring and slowly inflates airbags to lift their head and open their airway to reduce it. The accompanying app tracks sleep data, including snoring time, airbag operation time, sleep score, sleep time, and even recordings of your snoring to play back later.\nTo build on the technology, the company also introduced an accompanying Motion Ring to monitor your sleep status in real time and send data to the motion system for a more seamless experience. The combination of the ring with the pillow, known as motionsleep, earned the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.\nThe Motion Pillow alone costs $699, but it's 40% off during the CES exhibition period, retailing at $420.\n2. Bmind Smart Mirror\nThe Bmind Smart Mirror claims to be the world's first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness, according to manufacturer Baracoda. Leveraging generative AI, the mirror can provide personalized recommendations, such as light therapy sessions, guided meditation, and self-affirmations based on your mental state, to help improve your mood and manage stress.\nWhen I demoed the mirror, it asked me how my day was, and for testing purposes, I said it went terribly. Immediately, the mirror said encouraging words to me, switched the lights to a calming blue color, displayed an image of nature, and encouraged me to start a meditation session.\nThe mirror was even recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Smart Home category.\n3. Minitailz Smart Dog Collar\nIf you are a dog mom like me, you're probably always thinking of ways you could make your pet's quality of life better. Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar is a fitness tracker for your dog, and can help you better understand what they need.\nThe tracker detects a dog's GPS location to ensure your fur baby never gets lost, along with health stats such as resting heart rate and breathing. The company claims that the collars can detect early signs of heart failure before the onset of symptoms. The collar also offers AI-driven activity detection with real-time alerts that can let the pert owner know exactly what their pet is doing.\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category.\nIf you are interested, the Minitailz collar is available for $99. However, there is also a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\n4. Yarbo Multi-Purpose Intelligent Yard Robot\nTaking care of your yard can be a hassle, with the grass alone requiring cutting, fertilizing, and watering. The Yarbo multi-purpose yard robot system has a family of products designed to take care of nearly all your backyard tasks, including a snow blower, lawn mower, granular spreader, liquid spreader, and more.\nThe best part is that they all work with the same power docking station for a seamless experience. Many of the solutions are already available for purchase online, with newer models available for pre-order.\nAlso: The best robot lawn mowers\n5. Wim\nThe Wim first caught my attention because I had never seen an apparatus like it. Upon learning more, I realized that the technology was as innovative as it looked. The product is meant to assist in walking and exercising in a safe and efficient manner by providing the proper support.\nIt also includes personalized AI coaching that can help enhance your exercise experience by adjusting the intensity and timing and providing customized programs. The insights can also help with non-exercise coaching, such as improving walking performance. This could be especially helpful for people recovering from injuries or those with mobility challenges. When I tried it on, I was surprised to see how natural it felt and how unobstructed my walking was.\nThe product -- from South Korea's\u00a0WIRobotics\u00a0-- was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Accessibility & Aging Tech, Robotics category.\nSales for the product will begin in February, and I was not informed about pricing.\n6. Holobox\nThe Holobox makes hologram communication, which was typically limited to sci-fi movies, a reality. The box, which resembles a telephone booth, can display a real-life hologram of the person you are talking to, as long as they are in front of a white, well-lit background. They can communicate with you in nearly no latency, and even if you aren't in front of a white background yourself, the other call participant can still see you via monitor like a standard Zoom call instead of a hologram.\nYou can click here for a snippet of my experience, where I got to chat with the hologram of Holoconnects' CEO, Andre Smith.\nAlthough the technology seems complicated, it is a \"plug and play\" system, requiring only an outlet and the internet to function. The company also offers a desktop version, fittingly called the Holobox Mini. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\n7. Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo robot + stick vacuum\nOne of the most popular and practical robots is the robot vacuum. But a popular complaint about them is that no matter how efficient they are, they can often miss certain corners or nooks of your living space. Ecovocs addresses that issue by including a stick vacuum with its robot vacuum.\nThe charging station for the actual robot vacuum holds a concealed stick vacuum, which you can assemble to form a Matter-certified wireless stick vacuum with 8000Pa of suction. Now, if your robot misses something, getting to it yourself is easier.\nThe vacuum will be available at the end of March for $1,599.\n8. Nimble Beauty\nThe PR person delivering the demonstration called this AI-powered manicure device \"a Nespresso machine for manicures,\" and that title could not be more fitting. In the same way that a Nespresso machine can deliver barista-quality coffee to your home at the touch of a button, the Nimble Beauty device can act as an at-home nail salon. All you have to do is insert your hand and click a button, and the machine will do the rest using AI.\nI demo-ed the technology, and was the manicure perfect? No. But was it better than when I painted my right hand with my non-dominant left hand? Absolutely. The best part, in my opinion, is the convenience of not having to leave the house to get your nails done or worry about booking an appointment. Another benefit is that it has a fan that dries your nails between coats, so you don't have to worry about smudging them.\nThe device was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category.\nThe machine is available for preorder and costs $599 for the machine and $10 per nail polish capsule. Shipping begins in March.\n9. Ballie\nBallie, the circular household assistant robot, isn't new to Samsung\u00a0 -- it first launched in 2020. However, at this year's CES, Samsung showcased a revamped Ballie with new capabilities and AI features. The robot can now do everything from projecting video to managing home appliances.\nHaving watched the Samsung demo in person, I must say that I am not only impressed but would welcome the cute little basketball-looking robot into my home. Ballie was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nSamsung didn't disclose when it will be available or how much it will cost.\n10. Moonbird\nAs soon as I saw a sign that said that this device could reduce stress, I had to stop by the booth. The device, which fits in the palm of your hand comfortably, can help you reduce stress and anxiety by coaching you to breathe properly.\nThe device expands in your hands when you are supposed to breathe in and contracts when you are supposed to breathe out. This breathing exercise helps you slow down your breathing and concentrate on the act, which should, in turn, balance your autonomic nervous system. The device also has a sensor where you place your thumb to monitor certain metrics such as heart rate.\nThe device is available for purchase in four colors for $199.\n11. Anura MagicMirror\nAlthough this looks like an ordinary tabletop mirror, the Anura MagicMirror can do more than just show you your reflection. With a 30-second face scan, the mirror can gather your health data, such as heart rate and blood pressure.\nI got to demo the technology at CES, and it's as easy and intuitive to use as it sounds. The mirror was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Digital Health category.\nAlthough it seems like a fun gadget to have in your home, the PR team informed me that the intended audience is B2B such as doctors' offices or gyms.\n12. Nobi Smart Lamp\nNobi's smart lamps can ensure your older loved ones stay safe by doubling as fall detectors. The lamps use AI to detect when a person has fallen. After it detects the fall, it will notify designated emergency contacts, who can then talk to the fallen individual via the lamp, and even see the position the person is lying in.\nAt CES, the company announced the introduction into the US market, as well as the Nobi Ceiling, which is a ceiling version of its smart pendant lamp. From seeing it in person, I was amazed at how much like a regular lamp it looked.\n13. Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite\nIf you have read any of my CES roundups, you probably picked up on the fact that I love dogs. The Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is a device I am particularly excited about because it has the potential to improve the quality of dogs' lives significantly, and what could be better than that?\nThe Smart Tracker is placed on your dog's collar to track its behavior throughout the entire day. Then, based on your dog's activity levels and sleep, it lets you know the exact amount of food you should be feeding your dog for breakfast and dinner. The bowl has a button that will light up green when you have fed the proper amount or red when it's over or under, eliminating the need for measuring cups.\nI personally have met so many overweight dogs who could use losing some pounds, and this device eliminates the guesswork, helping the parents feed them the perfect amount and allowing them to get to an ideal lifestyle soon.\nAlthough it just launched at CES, the Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is available for purchase at $250, which includes the smart tracker, the hub, and the bowl.\n14. Rabbit R1\nIf you have ever wanted an AI assistant that can just do things for you without the need for lengthy and detailed prompts, the Rabbit might be the device for you. The pocket-sized Rabbit leverages AI to act as a personal assistant that can use apps for you.\nAlso: This AI startup made a $199 gadget that replaces apps with 'rabbits' - and it might just work\nEssentially, the R1 would eliminate having to scramble to find the right app on your phone, and then following through to complete the action you need. Instead, with the device, you can have some \"rabbits\" complete the task for you from start to finish simply by telling it what end-result you want done.\nThe device is $199 and is available for preorder.\nRelated\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nAI will unleash the next level of human potential.

The display of advanced software and hardware, including the ROBO Soul, ROBO Matrix and ROBO Galaxy, indicates a strong commitment to innovation in the intelligent driving space. The integration of these technologies into Lotus Tech's vehicles, such as the Eletre and Emeya, positions the company favorably in the luxury electric vehicle market, which is increasingly competitive.\nThe approval for L3 testing in Wuxi, China's pilot zone for internet of vehicles connectivity, is a strategic milestone for Lotus Tech. It not only demonstrates regulatory confidence in the company's technology but also provides a real-world testing ground to refine their autonomous systems. The potential for Lotus Tech to leverage this approval to accelerate the commercialization of their L3 and L4-ready hardware could be a catalyst for growth, attracting investor interest and potentially impacting the company's market valuation post-merger with LCAA.\nFurthermore, the mention of the world's first deployable LiDAR system and the use of multiple sensor types for enhanced vehicle perception underscores the company's technological edge. This could drive consumer demand and strengthen Lotus Tech's brand as a leader in the high-end EV segment. The implications for the stock market include increased investor confidence and possibly a positive reaction to Lotus Tech's shares, especially considering the anticipated Nasdaq listing under the ticker 'LOT' post-merger completion.\nFinancial Analyst\nThe merger between Lotus Technology Inc. and L Catterton Asia Acquisition Corp (LCAA) is poised to have a considerable impact on Lotus Tech's financial standing and investment attractiveness. The transition to becoming a public company via a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC) merger is a trend that has been observed in the tech and EV sectors, offering a quicker route to public markets compared to traditional IPOs. This strategy can provide Lotus Tech with access to capital markets and the liquidity needed to fuel further R&D and expansion efforts.\nInvestors will be closely monitoring the execution of the Merger Agreement and the subsequent performance of Lotus Tech as a public entity. The successful deployment of the showcased technologies and the progression of autonomous driving capabilities could serve as key drivers of Lotus Tech's revenue growth and market share expansion. The listing on the Nasdaq will increase the visibility of the company to a wider range of investors and could result in increased trading volumes and liquidity.\nThe stock market impact of this merger and Lotus Tech's technological advancements will largely depend on the company's ability to meet its Vision80 strategy goals and to effectively commercialize its autonomous driving technologies. However, investors should also consider the inherent risks associated with SPAC mergers, including regulatory scrutiny and the performance pressure post-listing, which could influence the stock's volatility and long-term performance.\nMarket Research Analyst\nThe autonomous driving sector is rapidly evolving and Lotus Tech's advancements showcased at CES are likely to resonate well with both consumers and investors. The company's focus on high-end autonomous driving features aligns with current consumer trends favoring advanced safety, convenience and technology in vehicles. Lotus Tech's strategic positioning in the luxury EV market, coupled with its innovative autonomous driving technologies, may enable it to capture a significant share of this niche but growing segment.\nThe global push towards autonomous and electric vehicles, supported by environmental policies and technological advancements, presents a favorable backdrop for Lotus Tech's growth trajectory. The company's presence at CES, a high-profile consumer technology platform and its subsequent testing in Wuxi's 'internet of vehicles' pilot zone, will likely enhance its brand recognition and credibility among potential customers and partners.\nFrom a market perspective, the anticipated completion of the merger with LCAA and the subsequent listing on the Nasdaq could create new investment opportunities and attract attention from institutional investors. The company's progress in the autonomous driving domain could also influence partnerships, mergers and acquisitions within the industry, as competitors and new entrants seek to keep pace with technological developments.\nNEW YORK and SINGAPORE, Jan. 9, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Lotus Technology Inc. (\"Lotus Tech\" or the \"Company\"), a leading global luxury electric vehicle maker, announced today that its intelligent driving arm, Lotus Robotics, will showcase numerous proprietary next-generation autonomous driving software and hardware solutions at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, USA.\nThe technologies on display, and Lotus Tech's recent receipt of approval to test conditional automated driving (\"Level 3\" or \"L3\") functions on highways in part of China,\u00a0demonstrate Lotus Tech's progress in executing the brand's Vision80 business transformation strategy and further advancing its global R&D prowess.\nThe ROBO Soul, ROBO Matrix, and ROBO Galaxy software being showcased at CES provide solutions for advanced driver assistance systems, remotely assisted operation, and cloud data management respectively. The technologies have been employed in Lotus Tech vehicles, contributing to their autonomous driving capabilities. The hyper SUV Eletre and hyper GT Emeya, for example, both feature cutting-edge autonomous driving hardware, aviation-level security and redundancy including dual NVIDIA DRIVE Orin chips, as well as the Company's industry-leading cognition module, which can intelligently identify and avoid risks on the road. Lotus Robotics is also displaying hardware it is developing as part of efforts to accelerate adoption of self-driving technology, including its ROBOCube intelligent street cleaner.\nIn recognition of Lotus Tech's leadership in intelligent driving, the Company recently received approval to test\u00a0L3 autonomous driving in Wuxi, a city near Shanghai serving as China's pilot zone for \"internet of vehicles\" connectivity. This licence allows Eletre drivers to use the vehicle's L3 functionality on designated highways in the city. Eletre is equipped with state-of-the-art L4-ready hardware including the world's first deployable LiDAR system, and leverages five different sensor types to supplement high-definition digital maps with live, 360\u00b0 perception.\n\"Lotus Robotics' leading technologies bear testament to Lotus Tech's world-class R&D innovation capabilities and signify a significant step forward in our Vision80 strategy. We look forward to testing these innovative technologies on the roads in Wuxi as we strive to strengthen Lotus Tech's intelligent driving capabilities and deliver even better, safer driving experiences to our customers around the world,\" said Mr. Qingfeng Feng, Chief Executive Officer of Lotus Tech.\nVisit Lotus Robotics at the Las Vegas Convention Center's North Hall, in the Tech East AI (Artificial Intelligence) pavilion at booth 9217 from January 9-12.\nAs announced in January 2023, Lotus Tech has entered into a definitive agreement and plan of merger (the \"Merger Agreement\") with L Catterton Asia Acquisition Corp (\"LCAA\") (NASDAQ: LCAA), a special purpose acquisition company formed by affiliates of L Catterton, a leading global consumer-focused investment firm.

Ballie projects itself into your heart\nBefore CES even began Samsung declared it was all-in on AI. This includes using vision models to tell you what food to make based on the contents of your fridge, launching new large language models for its cellphones and bringing smart robots to your home.\nBallie is part entertainment device, part chatbot and part home assistant. The round robot can project things onto the floor, wall or ceiling as it follows you around the home like a lost puppy.\nThe yellow bot can also message its owner to give an update on the pets, manage smart tech in the home and even answer calls on your behalf.\nThe problem is right now it's nothing more than a video. When the first version of Ballie was unveiled in 2020 a model was whizzing around the stage. This year we\u2019ve only seen it in a video, with no details on price, launch or availability.\n2. LG smart home agent\nYou wait all day for a bus then two come along at once. Or in this case, you don\u2019t wait for a tiny, cute robot that can link up with your home appliances but two still come along at once.\nNot to be outdone by Samsung, LG revealed its smart home agent. An AI-packed little bot on two legs that rolls around your home keeping an eye on your smart tech, pets and you.\nLG\u2019s little agent is basically a smart hub that can move about. It has a built-in large language model voice assistant so you can communicate with it in much the same way you can with ChatGPT voice and it can monitor your mood.\nConnected through the LG smart home platform ThinQ, it can manage washers, ovens and even refrigerators unaided. It uses machine learning to understand how the family interacts and uses devices and can perform voice and facial analysis. Like Bailee it has no price, release data or physical model to try out.\n3. Rise of the lawnbot \u2014 Segway Navimow\nRobot lawnmowers aren't a new idea. They've been around about as long as the robot vacuum with new models and companies rising and falling.\nThis year at CES we've seen a multitude of mowers, blowers and other gardening aids and one of the highlights is the Segway Navimow.\nThe Navimow H Series has been available in Europe for some time but is now coming to the U.S. for the first time. It uses AI vision technology and GPS positioning to navigate around even the most tricky yard and uses a small base station when GPS isn't available.\nThe H Series range features a BladeHalt sensor, a Rain sensor, an Ultrasonic sensor (H3000), and a VisionFence sensor (H3000), so it should be able to more easily detect and avoid objects on your lawn.\nPricing has not yet been made available for the U.S. market, but when it was released in Europe, the H500E was priced at \u20ac1,199 (about $1,300), the H800 was at \u20ac1,499, and the H3000E cost \u20ac2,499 (about $2,700).\n4. Oro is a buddy for your pets\nBoth Samsung's Ballie and the LG smart home agent boast pet-sitting capabilities, but the adorable big-eyed ORo from Ogmen Robotics goes a step further, being designed as a ball-throwing, food-delivering pet buddy.\nThe autonomous robot can take care of your dog when you're not at home. Priced at $799 and available from April it is fitted way a suit of sensors, two-way audio and an interactive video screen that lets you chat to your canine from anywhere.\nORo can also capture images and videos of your pet at play that you can then share online or keep to look back on. it also has a built-in food dispenser that can launch nibbles at your good boy and a separate automatic food bowl that the bot can control.\nOne of the most impressive features is its built-in AI that learns by watching the way your pet plays. It understands its behavior patterns and can play music or throw a ball when Rover becomes agitated or restless.\nORo is currently available for pre-order with a $299 downpayment with the remaining $500 due when it is ready to ship. It comes in cozy carbon and ivory mist. The price includes hte base-station, the dog bowl and the robot.\n5. Climbing up the stairs \u2014 MOBINN from RcLab\nThe MOBINN is a delivery robot with flexible wheels that allow it to drive on even ground and climb stairs while bringing you that parcel you need urgently.\nIt is a research example at the moment without a date for release or a price but it can maintain a constant and steady horizon for the main body ensuring the Starbucks you ordered doesn't spill on its way from the coffee shop down the street.\nThe M3 has a LiDAR-based mapping system to allow it to operate regardless of the terrain and can also work in rain, snow and at night.\n6. The Loona companion bot\nSometimes all you need to cheer you up is a pet but that isn't always practical. Enter Loona, the companion robot that uses ChatGPT to provide natural conversation with its owner.\nBuilt by Beijing KEYi Technology, the toy can play a range of interactive games, is a moveable home monitor and acts as a programming learning platform.\nThe cute little bot also includes gesture recognition technology, voice commands and graphic programming to allow users to create their own instructions.\nThe base model is $380 with a range of accessories and add-ons available including coding kits, game prop kits and a charging dock.\n7. Robot vacuum phone home\nRobot vacuum maker Roborock has a new flagship vacuum and mp called the S8 MaxV Ultra that includes a voice assistant, robot arm and video calling functionality.\nLaunching at CES 2024, the S8 MaxV can be controlled without the need for another device \u2014 just speak to it and tell it what to clean.\nThe built-in camera allows for AI-powered obstacle avoidance in addition to the ability to call its owner or have the owner call in remotely.\n6. Elderly companion robot\nIntuition Robotics is bringing generative AI to its elderly care companion robot ElliQ. The third generation of the bot, known as the ElliQ 3 uses AI to offer more engaging and two-way conversations for its users.\nSmaller and lighter than previous versions it also includes a screen fully integrated into the device rather than as a standalone tool.\nA built-in AI processing unit and a RAM increase also makes it easier to use and interact with as it can handle natural language conversations.\nIt also uses generative AI to better utilize information the user shares with the device such as favorite color, pet and religion. It can reference this information in conversations and choose activities based on user interests.\n7. A coffee making robot\nADAM is a robot barista from Richtech Robotics. Impressing at CES 2024 it can make hot or cold coffee with 21 unique menu offerings. It can also turn its hand to cold brew and Boba or mix up a cocktail.\nThe two-armed robot can interact with customers to take their order through a natural language interface, use its arms to make the drink and even wash up.\nEach arm can work independently to create two drinks at the same time and can be customized with different phrases depending on the use case or company.\nADAM is only available as a rental device for specific events. So far it is the main barista in a Manhattan coffee shop, served Boba at Cloutea on the Las Vegas strip and served drinks for Kendall Jenner at hte launch of her 818 Tequila signature bottle launch party.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nAI at CES 2024: Biggest announcements so far\nChatGPT in cars and grills with AI\nAlmost every announcement, keynote, and product at CES 2024 so far has included some type of update on of artificial intelligence.\u00a0From LG\u2019s robot butler to a grill that uses AI to improve cooking time and quality, the technology of the day is everywhere.\nIn some cases, AI is just a part of a bigger product, like using vision technology in a robot vacuum to improve object avoidance.\u00a0Elsewhere it is the entire announcement, such as Samsung going \u201call in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its product range.\nPart of this is so companies can capitalize on the hype surrounding AI, which anecdotally makes it easier to get funding. The bigger part is that the technology has matured to a point where it brings significant improvements in some areas.\nWhat has been announced around AI at CES 2024\nTo better break down the hype and find the real gems I\u2019ve pulled together some of the biggest announcements in the AI space at CES 2024.\nLG unveils smart home robot\nLG kicked off its CES showcase with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a \u201cZero Labor Home.\u201d\u00a0This AI-powered butler bot can organize your smart devices and even keep an eye on your pets when you\u2019re not home.\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for potential issues, and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience.\nThanks to the inclusion of Qualcomm\u2019s Robotics RB5 Platform, LG's robot uses AI to learn your interests and behaviors and get better over time at serving as a friendly home companion.\nSamsung declares \u201cAI for all\u201d at CES\nSamsung has been pushing the AI in everything narrative since last year and its keynote at CES \u2014 dubbed \"AI for all\" \u2014 turned out to be no different. The company makes everything from smartphones to home appliances and AI will be incorporated across the full range of products.\nWe've already seen details of refrigerators with cameras and AI vision technology. This allows the device to recommend recipes based on what it can see in the fridge. The company has also unveiled televisions with AI built in that can scale content to improve resolution and enhance the depth perception of an image. And there are also robot mops and vacuums that use AI to seek out stains.\nSamsung's biggest AI announcement may be yet to come. Next week, the company hosts Galaxy Unpacked, where it's expected to introduce the new Galaxy S24 lineup of smartphones. Samsung has already made it very clear that AI will play a central role with its next flagship devices.\nNvidia expands AI dominance\nDespite a near dominance in AI hardware for the past year, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. This is likely due to increased competition from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm in chips capable of running and training models.\nThe company unveiled the GeForce RTX series of desktop graphics cards that, while specifically aimed at the gaming sector, also have a \u201cready for AI\u201d feel.\nNot to be left out, AMD also unveiled its new Hawk Line CPUs complete with AI technology.\nMost of the AI is delivered through software capable of seamlessly offloading certain tasks to the neural processing units inside the new series of chipsets.\nAI coming to a car near you\nVolkswagen was one of a number of car companies announcing wider use of artificial intelligence as part of its in-car entertainment system.\nThe German carmaker is bringing OpenAI's ChatGPT to its vehicles, integrated into its existing IDA voice assistant to give it a more natural conversation style and ability to complete more complex requests\nAlso in the vehicle space, Bosch launched a pair of new AI-powered technologies at CES. The eye-tracking technology can see whether you are looking drowsy when you are driving, ask if you need a coffee when you get home and program your coffee machine to have a drink ready when you walk through the door.\nThe other eye-tracking tech from Bosch could be used while driving to determine what you're looking at and other information about the street sign, building or object. This could even include tell you the opening times of a nearby store or restaurant.\nCooking and cleaning with AI\nOne of the hottest tickets at AI is a smart grill that can reach a staggering 1,652\u00b0 F and cook the perfect ribeye steak in 90 seconds.\nSeergrills says\u00a0that its Perfecta grill uses a powerful quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure aspects of the food and environment, including thickness and temperature. This lets you control the cook and get perfect results every time.\nTo clean up the messes made from eating all that grilled food you need a mop or vacuum. Roborock's latest device uses AI to let it detect obstacles, find complex stains and even call home when it has an issue.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

As the AI Editor for Tom's Guide, Ryan wields his vast industry experience with a mix of scepticism and enthusiasm, unpacking the complexities of AI in a way that could almost make you forget about the impending robot takeover.\nWhen not begrudgingly penning his own bio - a task so disliked he outsourced it to an AI - Ryan deepens his knowledge by studying astronomy and physics, bringing scientific rigour to his writing. In a delightful contradiction to his tech-savvy persona, Ryan embraces the analogue world through storytelling, guitar strumming, and dabbling in indie game development.

Did anything truly deliver on technology\u2019s evergreen promise of a better future? Here\u2019s our selection of gadgets with promise and desirable devices, as well as the occasional curveball from the future that didn\u2019t quite convince. Around 1,400 different start-ups vied for attention alongside established brands, old and new, an indication of how hardware has become the new software.\nVoyage MagSafe charger by Native Union\nWhether or not this means there\u2019s a bubble in need of bursting is another matter. The current trend for injecting AI into everything from cars to dog wellbeing products shows the breadth of enthusiasm for the technology, even if its actual aims and benefits are harder to discern. Likewise, the domestic robotics industry is still waiting for its killer app.\nHP Spectre Fold Laptop\nThis year, there was even a \u2018Gallery of Flops\u2019, a self-referential Salon des Refus\u00e9s of commercially catastrophic ideas. Although most of the featured products were little more than tiny bumps in the road for major corporations (the Microsoft Zune, Amazon\u2019s Fire Phone, the Nintendo Virtual Boy), start-ups see shows like CES as very much a life or death situation. We\u2019ve already reported from CES 2024 to delve into the car industry\u2019s many and varied takes on tomorrow\u2019s tech, as well as the fast-growing beauty tech market.

If you\u2019ve the right kind of space (open and uncluttered), then devices like Samsung\u2019s new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo are a perfect match. The ubiquitous AI features include the ability to detect different flooring types and switch between scrubbing, sweeping and sucking depending on the surface, as well as a stain-detecting system. If the little puck-like Bot finds a dubious mark, it\u2019ll scuttle back to its clean station to heat its spinning mop pads and then return to tackle the problem.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, available soon, Samsung.com\nAirthings Renew\nIt's a breeze: Renew air purifier by Airthings\nQuiet and unimposing, just as you\u2019d hope, the new Airthings Renew air purifier is perfect for bedrooms and home offices. The compact grey cube was designed in Norway and has the power to filter out up to 99.7 per cent of fine airborne particles. It also syncs with the Airthings app to help you track, trace and clean up the quality of your indoor air.\nAirthings Renew air purifier, \u00a3349.99, Airthings.com\nAnura MagicMirror from NuraLogix\nLooking glass: Anura MagicMirror\nDesigned to works in harmony with the Canadian company\u2019s Anura app, which apparently provides \u2018medical-grade measurements using data gathered from a 30-second video selfie\u2019, the MagicMirror is a digital fit-check for your mental state. Meditech companies often claim far-reaching diagnostic capabilities, but if it works, the rectangular mirror requires you to sit still and gaze into its 21.5-inch screen; beneath the surface are AI-powered sensors that\u2019ll run a report on your vital signs.\nAnura MagicMirror, concept only, Nuralogix.ai\nBMind Smart Mirror from Baracoda\nMirror, mirror on the wall: BMind Smart Mirror from Baracoda\nMore about mindfulness than raw analytics, the BMind Smart Mirror is intended to give you a lift, not probe your inner workings. More AI is at play, sifting through a database of expressions and gestures to get a sense of how you appear to be and respond with light, sound and projected display. Described as an \u2018AI-driven virtual mindfulness coach\u2019, it\u2019s a fairytale device brought to life.\nBaracoda BMind Smart Mirror, concept only, Baracoda.com\nLG\u2019s Smart Home AI agent\nSmart bot: LG Smart Home AI Agent\nLG\u2019s Labs division crammed a lot of smart home devices into its CES 2024 display, including its Bon Voyage camping trailer. This little robot was also on show, intended as an AI-driven companion that also serves as a security guard and pet monitor. With the ability to detect faces and parse speech, the nameless bot is friendly enough for the home but could also serve as an all-round mobile monitoring station for a workplace.\nLG Smart Home AI Agent, concept only, LG.com\nPersonal tech: new devices for a data-heavy lifestyle\nSony XR Headset\nSensory immersion: Sony XR Headset\nWith Apple\u2019s Vision Pro poised for launch, Sony is one of many competitors hoping to get in on the augmented reality bandwagon. The XR Headset features twin 4K OLED microdisplays as well the see-through functionality offered by the Vision Pro. An array of six cameras and sensors help guide you through physical space, while control systems include a wearable ring and a pointing controller. Although aimed primarily at product designers and architects, the applications are potentially limitless.\nSony XR Headset, price and availability tbc, Sony.net\nLotus Ring\nWielding control: Lotus Ring\nMicro-wearables are a burgeoning market. Lotus\u2019 Ring is perhaps the simplest of the lot. This finger-borne controller doesn\u2019t monitor or measure; it simply controls. Using the same infrared technology as a traditional television remote control, users need to install special light-switch covers. After this, they can simply point at the switch to turn it on or off. Rather than see this as a contemporary version of the Clapper, the company is pitching the Ring as an accessibility aid.\nLotus Ring, GetLotus.com\nCreator Keyboard by Clicks\nSmart phones: Creator Keyboard by Clicks\nThe Creator Keyboard from Clicks urges you to step back into the distant days of the Blackberry. Essentially an iPhone case with a built-in physical backlit keyboard, the Creator should find favour with anyone who has never quite got the hang of touchscreens, as well as the retro crowd.

        "raw_content": "The Robot Report\nTop 10 robots seen at CES 2024\nBy Mike Oitzman | January 13, 2024\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 CES 2024 featured a wide range of emerging technologies, from fitness devices and videogames to autonomous vehicles. But robots always have a significant presence in the sprawling exhibit halls.\nThe Robot Report visited numerous booths in the Eureka Park section of CES, as well as in the other focused sections of the event. Here are some highlights from this week\u2019s event:\nMobinn climbs stairway toward success\nMobinn is a Korean startup focused on last-mile autonomous delivery vehicles. While the concept of last-mile delivery isn\u2019t new, Mobinn demonstrated an innovative wheeled robot that can climb stairs.\nThe robot is capable of going up and down stairs through the implementation of compliant wheels. A self-leveling box on top of the robot keeps the cargo level, so your drinks and food don\u2019t spill out of their containers.\nGlidance guides people with vision impairments\nThe latest prototype of the Glidance device is fully functional for public demos and includes a camera in the handle and radar sensors in the base. | Credit: The Robot Report\nRoboBusiness PitchFire 2023 winner Glidance also won a CES 2024 Innovation Award and showed the latest functional prototype of its Glide device in its booth. The robotic Glide guides sight-impaired individuals similar to a guide dog.\nThe startup is designing Glide to be affordable and easy to learn how to use when it starts shipping later this year. I tried Glide firsthand (while closing my eyes). The experience was incredible, and I can only imagine how promising this technology would be for an individual with sight loss.\nThe team at Glidance mentioned to me that celebrity Stevie Wonder came to the Glidance booth for a demo of the product during CES.\nUnitree H1 humanoid steals the show\nThere were two full-size humanoid robots at CES 2024.\nKepler Robotics had a stationary model of the new Kepler Forerunner K1 in its Eureka Park booth. The robot includes 14 linear-axis motors and 14 rotary-axis motors. Unfortunately, the company was unable to give live demos of the Forerunner.\nThe Unitree H1 humanoid robot uses sensors in its \u201chead\u201d to perceive the world around the robot as it navigates and avoids obstacles. | Credit: The Robot Report\nThe internet influencer darling of CES has to be the Unitree H1 humanoid, and the company was giving nearly continuous live demos of the H1 at its booth.\nKudos to the Unitree marketing team for its now-infamous \u201ckick the robot\u201d videos that have been shared on social media over the past six months. In the videos, H1 appears to be a solid humanoid platform with respectable balance and agility.\nHowever, as a longtime robotics industry insider and experienced robotics applications engineer, I thought the Unitree H1 product demos at CES 2024 were cringe-worthy, as the Unitree demo team walked the H1 robot into crowds of \u201cinternet tech influencers\u201d with their cameras ablaze.\nThe 150 lb. (68 kg) robot danced with the public inches away. A single tripping incident would have sent the robot tumbling into an innocent bystander and made instant headlines. It would have been a public relations disaster and a setback for the industry.\nHowever, there\u2019s no denying that the H1 was a crowd favorite at CES 2024, and the company and its robot received a lot of news media attention.\nHyundai displays future mobility tech at CES 2024\nHyundai PnD Module concept\nThe company had multiple large-scale booths showing autonomy concepts for the future, including autonomous mobility for both humans and freight, as well as a look at the future of autonomous construction vehicles. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get to witness either of the live mobility demonstrations, but the Hyundai Construction Xite concept tractor was an impressive incarnation of autonomous construction designs.\nHyundai presented a concept for the future of autonomous construction equipment with the display of the Construction Xite tractor (Editors note: for scale, the bucket arm is over 10 ft tall). | Credit: The Robot Report\nAV24 rolls into the showroom\nThe Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) had an impressive booth in the automotive hall of CES 2024, surrounded by well-known brand names. On display was a fully functional version of the newest AV24 autonomous racecar, showing off the integration of an entirely new autonomy stack in the vehicle.\nThe IAC has partnered with many of the leading automotive technology companies to embed the latest lidar, radar, vision, and GPS sensors within the vehicle.\ndSpace announced an extended partnership with IAC that will deliver digital twins of each university team\u2019s vehicle along with digital twins of each of the race tracks. In turn, these will enable the teams to train the AI drivers completely in simulation and then port the AI models and drive code directly the physical race cars.\nIn addition, some sanctioned sim races are possible later this year, said the IAC organizers.\nEmbodied AI displays updated Moxie\nThe latest generation of Moxie by Embodied AI was on display in Amazon\u2019s booth at CES. Embodied recently announced new tutoring functionality with the latest software release for Moxie, and it demonstrated the software at the expo.\nAmazon had a separate expo suite that featured all of the physical Amazon consumer and smart home products (Amazon Astro was noticeably absent from the display). Moxie entertained the gathered crowds as it demonstrated its interactivity.\nFingervision measures gripper force\nMy \u201cUnknown Discovery\u201d award of CES 2024 goes to a young Japanese startup called Fingervision. This was a serendipitous discovery of an innovation that uses tiny cameras built into the gripper fingers of an industrial robot,\nThey provide feedback on the grip force and \u201cslippage\u201d of an item held with the gripper. This is accomplished by imaging the area where the fingers touch an object through an opaque surface. Thus the origin of the company name.\nThe company has deployed its first grippers into an application where robots are picking up fried chicken nuggets and packaging them.\nHonorable mentions from CES 2024\nGatik keeps on trucking \u2014 autonomously\nGatik showed the third generation of its on-road autonomous truck. The company has made its mark on autonomous logistics through the deployment of driving algorithms that plans paths so that the vehicle only makes right-hand turns, avoiding more complex and dangerous left-hand turns.\nGatik first demonstrated fully driverless, freight-only commercial deliveries on the middle mile with Walmart in 2021. Shortly after, it\u00a0executed the first fully driverless deployment for Canada\u2019s largest retailer, Loblaw.\nThe company also announced a partnership with Goodyear tires to develop \u201cSmart Tires\u201d that can provide real-time feedback to the autonomous driver with data about the condition of the tires to help maintain traction and control.\nBobcat Rogue X2 gets ready to move the earth\nAt CES 2024, Bobcat showed off an autonomous concept prototype, the Bobcat Rogue X2, at CES 2024. The all-electric, autonomous robot is designed for handling material movement and ground-altering operations at construction, mining, and agriculture sites.\nThe design prototype of the Rogue X2 at CES had wheels rather than tracks, but manually driven Bobcats can be equipped with tracks, so a production version of the Rogue could have similar configurations.\nOttonomy IO partners with Harbor Lockers\nThrough a new partnership with Harbor Lockers, the latest generation of Ottobot can now be configured with a payload of Harbor Lockers. This includes the Harbor Locker physical locker infrastructure, as well as the Harbor Locker application interface.\nThis is the first time that Ottonomy is partnering with a third-party vendor to extend the autonomous last-mile delivery solution.\nLawn-mowing robots arrive in North America\nCES is one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer electronics shows. While The Robot\u00a0Report doesn\u2019t typically cover consumer robotics, it is notable that lawn-mowing robotics were ubiquitous at CES this year, with a dozen vendors showing their autonomous systems.\nThe European market for consumer lawnmowers is already mature, but the North American market is in the early stages of adoption. Without testing all of the different lawnmowing robots, it\u2019s difficult to determine the market leaders, but the two most promising solutions that I saw at the show included the new Yarbo Lawn Mower and the latest generation of Navimow from Segway Robotics.\nmowers-navimow\nMike Oitzman is Editor of WTWH's Robotics Group and founder of the Mobile Robot Guide.

        "score": 0.66372,
        "raw_content": "The best robot vacuums unveiled at CES 2024 go where Roombas still haven't\nThe robot vacuums unveiled at CES 2024 are ushering in a new era of automated at-home cleaning. And none of them are Roombas.\nLike Apple, iRobot doesn't do CES. Rather, the latest Roombas arrived in September 2023 and had a peaceful few months of (basically) being the best in the business. That's changing with the 2024 fleet of new flagship models from brands like Roborock, Samsung, Ecovacs, and Eufy, all of which showcased serious upgrades to their previous robot vacuums.\nWe're seeing a few recurring glow-ups that are setting new standards for ways a robot vacuum can make your life easier: Small obstacle avoidance (think phone chargers, socks, and pet waste) is non-negotiable at this point, but fully self-sufficient mopping \u2014 real elbow grease, AI-fueled stain detection, and automated washing and drying of mopping pads \u2014\u00a0is the clear theme of the year. Even the most advanced Roomba doesn't offer those last two bullet points.\nBelow, we're diving into the details of our favorite 2024 competitors, as well as hashing out the differences between the new models and their predecessors. We'll also give pricing and release date information if we have it.\nRoborock S8 Max Ultra, and S8 MaxV Ultra\nIt feels like just yesterday (was October not last month?) that Roborock dropped its last bots of 2023, the Q5 Pro and Q8 Max series. However, Roborock operates on both its release schedule and the CES schedule, and there are yet again new Roborocks.\nThe more premium vacs of the two new series are the S8 Max Ultra, and S8 MaxV Ultra. This series' main claim to fame is a bendy robotic arm that extends from the underside of the vacuum to detail spots that a side brush would miss \u2014\u00a0a longstanding blind spot of even the most powerful robot vacuums.\nA front-facing camera is also on board, which guides more meticulous small obstacle and stain detection and can livestream footage as it roves \u2014 technically giving you the ability to talk to someone who's at home by talking through the app.\nSmarts aside, we'd be remiss not to mention the enhanced suction power on these bad boys: the Max Ultra clocks 8,000 Pa while the S8 MaxV Ultra clocks a whopping 10,000 Pa \u2014\u00a0doubling the power of so many vacs on the current market that were previously thought to be pretty damn powerful.\nLike the S8 Pro Ultra, which was unveiled at last year's CES, the S8 Max Ultra and MaxV Ultra docks wash mop heads and dry them with warm air, then refill the water tank in the bot itself. If you'd prefer to also not be responsible for manually refilling the larger water tank in the dock itself, there is a version of both new S8s that can be hooked up directly to your home's drainage system.\nStarting in April 2024, the Roborock S8 Max Ultra will be available for $1,599.99 and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra will be available for $1,799.99.\nRoborock Q Revo Pro and Q Revo MaxV\nThe more affordable new series is the Q Revo line, with both the Revo Pro and Revo MaxV sticking close to the $1,000 price point. (The latter is more expensive due to the presence of a built-in voice assistant.)\nAside from aesthetic differences of the docks, the main difference from the S8 line is the Q Revo's focus on more detailed mopping than sheer suction power. It mops with two oscillating mopping pads spinning at 200 RPM (rather than the S8's singular pad) for a closer clean around obstacles like table legs.\nCompared to the S8 series, the new Revo models clean with 7,000 Pa of suction instead of 10,000 \u2014\u00a0still impressive \u2014\u00a0and are equipped with the same FlexiArm design to reach into corners. They also wash and dry the mopping pads.\nThe Q Revo Pro will go for $999.99 and the Q Revo MaxV will go for $1,199.99 when they become available for purchase in April 2024.\nEcovacs X2 Combo\nSpeaking of corner cleaning, Ecovacs is once again taking the literal route with another square robot vacuum \u2014\u00a0its second released in three months. After the Sept. 2023 drop of the Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni (a welcomed upgrade over the frustrating Deebot X1 Omni) Ecovacs has already found a unique way to build on its most advanced robot vacuum: adding a handheld vacuum to the ensemble.\nYes, \"Combo\" refers to a new docking station that charges the robot vacuum itself on one side and a cordless handheld vacuum on the other side \u2014\u00a0because we all know that there are some intricate messes that you'd prefer to tackle by hand. Both vacuums self-empty into the bi-directional dustbin in the middle.\nOther features seen in the X2 Omni that have carried over to the X2 Combo include mopping, washing and drying of the mopping pads, automatic water tank refilling, AI obstacle avoidance, and a voice assistant called Yiko that you can use to beckon the vacuum to wherever you're standing. Unlike the X2 Omni, the Combo is also Matter-ready, meaning it's compatible with several smart home systems.\nThe Ecovacs X2 Combo will cost $1,599 upon release, which is TBA but likely in the spring.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+\nSamsung's booth theme for CES 2024 \u2014 and the bigger theme for CES as a whole this year, apparently \u2014\u00a0is AI. More tangibly, Samsung's lean into AI is showcased in its new robot vacuum, the Bespoke Jet Combo AI+. Though it isn't Samsung's first robot vacuum with \"AI\" in the name, it does use AI in a major new way. On top of AI-powered smart mapping and AI-powered small obstacle detection, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ can also detect stains on hard floors without you having to designate a cleaning zone in the app.\nSo yes, Samsung's flagship robot vacuum finally mops. Once the Jet Bot finds a stain, the bot quickly returns to the dock to heat the mopping pads with hot enough water to create steam, then heads back to the problem spot to scrub, spinning at 170 RPM.\nIn line with the trend of fully automated mopping that we've been seeing, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ charges on a self-emptying dock that also auto-fills the Jet Bot's water tank and washes and dries the mop.\nPricing and a release date for the Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ are still up in the air. Its predecessor, the Jet Bot AI+ that does not mop, debuted at $1,299.99 in 2021, so we expect the Combo AI+ to be slightly more expensive than that upon release.\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nEufy's latest botvac doesn't necessarily do anything that we haven't seen before. It empties itself, mops with some elbow grease, washes and dries its mopping pads, and avoids obstacles like cords and socks. It's a solid checklist that's almost expected at this point in the game.\nWhat is groundbreaking about the X10 Pro Omni, though, is the fact that it secures all of those features for half the cost of multiple other vacuums in this list.\nWhile Ecovacs takes a break from using \"Omni\" in its robot vacuum names, Eufy's Omni era will undoubtedly change the game for the sub-$1,000 robot vacuum category. Despite debuting at a price point that's $100 less than its predecessor, the X9 Pro, the X10 Pro Omni dishes out significantly stronger suction power (8,000 Pa versus the X9 Pro's 5,500 Pa) and cleans with a new edge-hugging feature for better baseboard and corner attention. It's also square-ish with rounded edges.\nLike the X9 Pro, the X10 Pro Omni mops with dual spinning, pressurized mops that are fully lifted above carpeting and rugs when it's sensed. After mopping, the self-empty dock also washes and dries the mopping pads.\nThis packed checklist should cost way more than the mere $799.99 price that Eufy's asking, but we're not complaining. You can secure the X10 Pro Omni for yourself starting on Feb. 20.\nTopics\nCES\nRobot Vacuums\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers essential home tech like vacuums and TVs as well as sustainable swaps and travel.

It also looks like LG\u2019s two-legged robot\u2019s sibling. More than flashing movies on surfaces, Ballie is an all-around home manager and assistant. It roams around the house autonomously, monitors the surroundings to make sure there are no smart appliances or devices left switched on, and guards the people and pets by sending alerts to the owners running errands outside.\nSamsung says that its AI robot Ballie can be connected to these smart devices and appliances at home, so owners can take some household chores off their workload and share them with the robot. As routines and patterns recur, Ballie remembers them so the next time the owner wants to do something, say, switch on a lamp at a specific hour, the AI robot is already ahead of the user and turns it on or off for them. The continuous learning of the AI robot is one of the features that make it tailored to the user\u2019s needs.\nvideo stills courtesy of Samsung, via Youtube\nBall-shaped AI robot that controls smart appliances\nAt CES 2024, Samsung introduces Ballie\u2019s other features. The AI robot that glides on the floor on its own greets the owners when they open the front door and can project a welcome message for them on the floor as a replacement for doormats. Ballie can also set the mood for any home activity, whether the owners are exercising, working, or relaxing by playing the music that suits the atmosphere and increasing or decreasing the brightness of the lights based on how it learns the users\u2019 patterns.\nThe AI robot can also automatically answer phone calls when the owners are too busy to pick up the phone. It rolls close to them so the owners can converse with the caller, and they can hear their responses through the built-in speakers. Ballie can also display current news and events, including weather updates, on any surfaces the owners wish, and because of its installed projector, sensors, and cameras, Samsung\u2019s AI robot can also become a sizeable monitor screen for work or school.\nSamsung\u2019s AI robot Ballie can project and play movies on any surface\nTaking work calls using projected screen\nAs seen in the video, it is enough to place Ballie on a desired surface, and it can extend the computer screen of the users on the wall, floor, and more. The users then can continue working on their sketches, surfing the internet, and even switching between work calls and meetings using its projector. It was in 2020 when Samsung first introduced the rolling AI robot during CES 2020, but since then, it has evolved into a home manager and AI companion with a given name Ballie.\nSamsung\u2019s vision for how it plans to integrate and keep using artificial intelligence for its future electronics, including Ballie, is what makes up its presentation during CES 2024. Jong-Hee (JH) Han, Vice Chairman, CEO, and Head of Samsung\u2019s Device eXperience (DX) Division, opened the press conference by describing how AI will enable connected technologies to improve people\u2019s daily lives while always remaining nonintrusive and in the background.
