The company will present 20 new mobility technologies that are ready for immediate mass production.\nAt CES, Mobis will focus its efforts on growing its international sales by targeting global clients. Various products in areas such as automotive components, electrification, lamp and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) will be showcased to potential clients, including its future mobility core technologies, such as the Innovative Display series \u2014 rich in high-value advanced technology \u2014 and the high-power Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU).\nThe Innovative Display series, which is a collection of high-value, cutting-edge technologies, will be the focus at the Mobis exhibition. The company will present its leading innovative display technologies for automobiles, such as the world's first in-vehicle rollable display and swivel display, as well as the Quantum Dot and Local Dimming Display (QL) display and 3D display that feature OLED-level performance in LCD.\nTransparent display Hyundai Mobis plans to unveil at CES 2024\nA transparent display for automobiles will be presented for the first time during the exhibition. This product is a next-generation display which employs holographic optical elements technology. The display can realize the projection of clear images on a transparent panel while providing drivers with a wider sense of space and openness than that of general displays.\nTransparent displays enable images to be magnified on the front windshield. Thus, drivers can check various display information without shifting their gaze too much, increasing the level of safety. Because of their unique features, it is expected that transparent displays will bring many changes to future automobile designs once they are mass produced. Estimates indicate significant demand from global car manufacturers, creating high expectations for the display's future technological development and mass production.\nInnovative technologies in the field of electrification, the driving force for future growth, also await to be selected by global automakers based on Mobis' abundant mass production know-how. At the center of electric driving is the 22 kW-class ICCU, which Mobis proudly presents along with its battery system (BSA).\nICCU is a key element for electric vehicle charging and driving and is a power conversion system integrating elements such as DC/AC charging devices and communication equipment. The higher the output, the better the charging speed and efficiency. If the 22 kW-class ICCU is installed in an electric vehicle with the same specifications, the vehicle's charging time is reduced by half when compared to that of an 11 kW-class ICCU.\nMoreover, the 22 kW-class ICCU is closely related to vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, a type of electric car battery used as a large power source, offering limitless versatility. Mobis is planning to lead related markets through its 22 kW-class ICCU, which surpasses the capability of the 11 kW-class and has received the greenlight for mass production.\nAdditionally, Mobis will introduce its future mobility vehicle, which utilizes next-generation mobility technologies, for the first time at CES. In the past, the exhibition has been mainly comprised of visual displays, showcasing technical products and concept cars. However, this year, exhibition visitors will be allowed to get in the actual automobile, offering attendees an interactive and enjoyable experience. The automobile is equipped with features, such as the e-Corner system, that have been capturing the public's attention. This system allows all four wheels to turn 90 degrees, enabling parallel movement.\n* Hyundai Mobis Booth: Las Vegas Convention Center, West Hall #5216\nAbout Hyundai Mobis\nHyundai Mobis is the global no. 6 automotive supplier, headquartered in Seoul, Korea.

The latest version of the most talked about entry technology such as Future Cockpit Integrated Solution (MVICS 5.0) and Hologram AR-HUD, as well as various products in the fields of electronic, electrification, lamps, and AAM are waiting for global customers to choose.\u00a0\u25a0 \u2018Innovative Display\u2019 series such as \u2018First Line\u2019 Transparent Display\u00a0First, the \u2018Innovation Display\u2019 series, which is intensive of high-value-added high-tech, is considered as the representative. Advanced leading display technologies such as \u2018QL Display\u2019 and \u20183D Display\u2019, which realize OLED-class performance in LCD, starting with \u2018rollable display\u2019 and \u2018swivel display\u2019 for vehicles, will be released.\u00a0In particular, it is necessary to pay attention to the \u2018transparent display\u2019 for vehicles that will be unveiled this time. Transparent display is a next-generation display technology with holographic optical element technology. While implementing clear image projection on a transparent panel, it gives drivers a greater sense of space and openness compared to a regular display.\u00a0It is also noteworthy that it is possible to expand the front glass of the vehicle. Various display information can be checked without the driver\u2019s attention, which improves safety. Since it is a different type of display solution than the existing one, if mass production is applied, it is expected to bring a lot of changes in vehicle design in the future. It is said that there is a large demand for global finished cars, so expectations for future technological development and mass production are high.\n\u25a0 Expected to lead the market with a 22kW class ICCU (Integrated Charge Control Module)\u00a0Innovative technologies in the field of electrification, which are the driving force of future growth, also await the selection of global finished cars based on rich mass-produced experience. At the heart of the electrified drive, the 22kW Integrated Charge Control Module (ICCU) confidently presented by Hyundai Mobis along with the Battery System (BSA) is at the center of it.\u00a0ICCU is a power conversion system that integrates DC AC charging and communication equipment as the core of charging and driving electric vehicles. The higher the power, the better the charging speed and efficiency, and the electric vehicle of the same specification is equipped with a 22kW class ICCU, which reduces the charging time by half compared to the 11kW class.\u00a0It is also closely linked to V2G (Vehicle to Grid) technology, which uses electric vehicle batteries as a kind of large power source, and its utilization is endless. Hyundai Mobis is going beyond the currently commonly used 11kW class to lead the related market with the product that has raised the 22kW class ICCU technology to the level of mass production.\u00a0Hyundai Mobis plans to maximize the creation of new orders with aggressive sales activities that appeal to these core component technologies and commercialities. Hyundai Mobis is accelerating diversification of its customers and expanding its order performance by recording $8.77 billion in global core parts orders by the third quarter of this year, significantly exceeding its original annual target ($5.36 billion).\u00a0Meanwhile, Hyundai Mobis will unveil the \u2018Future Mobility Proof Car\u2019 that applies next-generation mobility technology for the first time at this CES. In the meantime, if the exhibition with the eyes of technology products and concept cars has been the main, you can enjoy the demonstration by directly riding a vehicle with an e-corner system that has attracted public attention. It is expected to attract attention with a differentiated event that makes you feel that the future mobility era is not far away.\n2026 Hyundai Palisade Spied for the First Time\nHyundai and Kia Revolutionize EV Aerodynamics with \u2018Active Air Skirt\u2019 Technology\nUS-Spec Hyundai IONIQ 5 N Spotted Testing\nNext-Gen Genesis GV80 to be Released in 2026 as an All-Electric\nKOREAN CAR BLOG TV\nIt\u2019s all about the Korean automakers Hyundai, Kia & Genesis.

(Image courtesy of LG Display)\nSEOUL, Jan. 2 (Korea Bizwire) \u2013\u00a0LG Display is gearing up to make a significant impact at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas, where the company plans to unveil a range of next-generation automotive display solutions. The company is set to showcase its innovative technology, specifically tailored for the rapidly evolving mobility industry.\nAt the heart of LG Display\u2019s presentation at CES 2024 is its focus on software-centric vehicles, often referred to as \u201cwheel-based smartphones\u201d or Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs).\nThese vehicles represent a shift towards more integrated and smart technology within the automotive industry. LG Display\u2019s offerings are optimized for SDVs, highlighting the company\u2019s commitment to leading the charge in display technology suited for modern mobility needs.\nA key feature of LG\u2019s showcase is the introduction of a range of display solutions including the 48-inch Pillar-to-Pillar LTPS LCD and the 18-inch Slidable OLED, forming part of a digital cockpit.\nThese displays represent a leap forward in vehicle interior design, offering expansive, high-resolution screens that stretch across the dashboard, enhancing both functionality and aesthetics.\nThe technology behind these displays is equally impressive. P-OLED (Plastic-OLED) uses a flexible plastic substrate, allowing for lightweight and bendable displays with exceptional image quality. ATO (Advanced Thin OLED) utilizes a glass substrate, offering affordability without compromising on quality.\nMeanwhile, the LTPS (Low-Temperature Polycrystalline Silicon) LCD is favored for its ability to create large, high-resolution displays.\nAnother notable innovation is the Switchable Privacy Mode (SPM), designed to enhance driver safety by controlling the display\u2019s viewing angles.\nThis technology ensures that while passengers can enjoy video playback on their screens, these visuals remain invisible from the driver\u2019s seat, thereby reducing distractions.\nIn addition to these advancements, LG Display is also introducing slidable and foldable OLED solutions for rear-seat entertainment. These designs cater to the spatial constraints of vehicle interiors, offering passengers a customizable and versatile viewing experience.\nKim Byeong-koo, the head of LG Display\u2019s Automotive Business Group, expressed confidence in these innovations, stating, \u201cWe are committed to further strengthening our position as the world leader in automotive display solutions, with a focus on catering to the needs of future mobility.\u201d\nKevin Lee (kevinlee@koreabizwire.com)\nRelated Posts\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Designed to be adaptable, the PV5 can function in various roles, such as a taxi, delivery van, or personal recreational vehicle. Its modularity is enabled by \u201cEasy Swap\u201d technology, which allows the vehicle's chassis to support different \u201clife modules\u201d for varied uses. This adaptability is enabled by a \u201cDynamic Hybrid\u201d body structure, offering adjustable lengths for different purposes without compromising vehicle strength.\nKia's purpose-built vehicle strategy unfolds in three phases. Initially, the focus is on vehicles like the PV5, optimized for sectors including ride-hailing and delivery services. These vehicles will also have enhanced connectivity, allowing them to operate efficiently as part of a fleet.\nThe second phase expands the lineup with models like the PV7 and PV1, introducing AI-driven mobility platforms. These platforms will use data analytics to interact with users and stay updated. In the final phase, Kia envisions its PBVs as fully integrated into a future mobility ecosystem, functioning as customizable platforms within smart city infrastructures.\nSustainability is a cornerstone of Kia's PBV design. The vehicles will incorporate materials like bioplastics and recycled fabrics, aligning with environmental conservation goals while offering a unique aesthetic. The design language of these vehicles is rooted in simplicity and functionality, prioritizing user-friendly features over decorative elements.\nKia's strategy goes beyond vehicle design, encompassing a comprehensive business system. This includes a new dedicated factory in Autoland Hwaseong, Gyeonggi Province, set to open in 2025 with a production capacity of 150,000 units annually. The factory will adopt a hybrid production method, combining conventional and cell-based manufacturing processes.\n\u201cBy 2030, the global market for light commercial vehicles is expected to hit 3.5 million units, with 1.5 million being electric, and Kia targets 300,000 of these,\u201d said CEO Song.\nKia is also enhancing its in-vehicle infotainment, fleet management systems and EV charging solutions with the software-defined vehicle system that Hyundai Motor Group announced earlier on Monday. These systems will leverage AI and data analytics to provide predictive maintenance, efficient routing and tailored charging schedules.\nIn autonomous driving, Kia, in collaboration with Motional, plans to develop and operate a robotaxi service by 2028 with its PBVs, leveraging advanced Level 4 autonomous driving technology.\n\u201cKia will stand out in the B2B light commercial market, moving beyond the typical approach of simply converting existing vehicles to electric with the bold modular approach. Our commitment is to continuously refine the user experience through software updates and specialized apps,\u201d said Kim Sang-dae, head of the company's strategic business planning division.\nThe anticipated cost for the PV5 model for business customers is around $35,000.\nArticles by Moon Joon-hyun\nMore from Headlines\nThe Korea Herald by Herald CorporationCopyright Herald Corporation.

The company\u2019s newly appointed CEO, Lee Gyu-suk, and other sales executives are greeting clients to seek business opportunities.\nArticles by Byun Hye-jin\nMore from Headlines\nThe Korea Herald by Herald CorporationCopyright Herald Corporation.
