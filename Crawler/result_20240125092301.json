        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

He will take on the role of strategic connector and influencer within our key markets. This includes introducing potential adopters, customers, and partners to contribute towards Flexxon\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s growth initiatives.\nHere's a little more about Felix, in his own words:\n\u00e2\ufffd\u201cQ: What about cybersecurity most excites you?\n\u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00b8A: The innovative solutions that are being developed to help make for a safer and more secure digital world for all.\u00c2\u00a0And what's more exciting is the fact that Flexxon's cybersecurity products are firmware-based and AI-powered, making them unique in the industry today.\n\u00e2\ufffd\u201cQ: What is the most pressing security concern for today's digital society?\n\u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00b8A: Securing critical national infrastructure - energy, utilities, communications, transportation. Any failure in one or more of these can be extremely disruptive to society and perhaps even catastrophic to the country's economy. Just imagine a scenario where power is lost through a cyberattack at a national scale for just 24 hours and you will begin to appreciate the enormous repercussions this one thing alone can do to our lives, our businesses, and our economy.\n\u00e2\ufffd\u201cQ: What do you most look forward to in this role?\n\u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00b8A: As we're on the cusp of being able to harness the power of quantum computing and are already witnessing the power of generative AI, you can begin to imagine how quickly cybercrime can escalate. This role then allows me the\u00c2\u00a0opportunity to share the benefits of \"being prepared ahead of time\" through Flexxon's innovative cybersecurity products with my networks here and around the region.\nGive us a \u00f0\u0178\u2018\ufffdthumbs up\u00f0\u0178\u2018\ufffd if you agree with Felix and share his (and Flexxon's) commitment to a safer digital space for all!\n#newhire #cybersecurity #flexxon #singaporejobs #singapore\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n5,311 followers\n\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u201e \"It's only three weeks into January and we've been so busy. I'm really excited!\"\nIf you've been following our sprint into 2024, you'd know exactly what our CEO Camellia Chan was referring to in this interview with MONEY FM 89.3's\nTian Tian C..\nListen in here: https://lnkd.in/gddG3-QF\n#cybersecurity #zerotrust #hardwaresecurity #hardwaredesign #ransomeware #singapore\nOn Under the Radar today: Flexxon on the value behind marrying hardware and cybersecurity, Launches at CES 2024\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s all about storing your computer data safely and securely through the use of hardware solutions.\nYou might recall storing data in hard disk drives in the past which often has slow reading and writing speeds.\u00c2\nFast forward to today, super-fast SSDs or Solid State Drive that use NAND-based flash memory to store data are more commonly used, as they are said to be more reliable and efficient than hard drives.\nBut while they may be faster, the question remains as to whether using SSDs are more secure. And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the problem that our guest Flexxon wants to address.\nFounded in 2007, FLEXXON is a Singapore-headquartered firm that marries cybersecurity solutions and hardware. In particular, the firm launched the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first AI-embedded firmware based cybersecurity solution called the X-PHY\u00c2\u00ae Cybersecure SSD in 2021.\nThe solution detects anomalies in behavioural data access patterns and effectively shuts down potential incursions in real-time to prevent critical data loss and exposure.\nThe solution has since been integrated into laptops with major PC makers including Lenovo, ASUS, HP, and THOMSON COMPUTING / METAVISIO. But how does it work exactly?\nMeanwhile, the Heliconia Capital Management-backed firm also said it has 30 patents under its belt, but what can we look forward to in terms of its product pipeline for the year?\nGlad to pose some of my burning questions to Camellia Chan, CEO and Founder, FLEXXON joining us from San Francisco. Camelia was also in Las Vegas for the CES tech show 2024 last week.\nMany thanks to Camellia and Samantha Wong for joining us on MONEY FM 89.3!

Any failure in one or more of these can be extremely disruptive to society and perhaps even catastrophic to the country's economy. Just imagine a scenario where power is lost through a cyberattack at a national scale for just 24 hours and you will begin to appreciate the enormous repercussions this one thing alone can do to our lives, our businesses, and our economy.\n\u00e2\ufffd\u201cQ: What do you most look forward to in this role?\n\u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00b8A: As we're on the cusp of being able to harness the power of quantum computing and are already witnessing the power of generative AI, you can begin to imagine how quickly cybercrime can escalate.

And that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the problem that our guest Flexxon wants to address.\nFounded in 2007, FLEXXON is a Singapore-headquartered firm that marries cybersecurity solutions and hardware. In particular, the firm launched the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first AI-embedded firmware based cybersecurity solution called the X-PHY\u00c2\u00ae Cybersecure SSD in 2021.\nThe solution detects anomalies in behavioural data access patterns and effectively shuts down potential incursions in real-time to prevent critical data loss and exposure.\nThe solution has since been integrated into laptops with major PC makers including Lenovo, ASUS, HP, and THOMSON COMPUTING / METAVISIO. But how does it work exactly?\nMeanwhile, the Heliconia Capital Management-backed firm also said it has 30 patents under its belt, but what can we look forward to in terms of its product pipeline for the year?\nGlad to pose some of my burning questions to Camellia Chan, CEO and Founder, FLEXXON joining us from San Francisco. Camelia was also in Las Vegas for the CES tech show 2024 last week.\nMany thanks to Camellia and Samantha Wong for joining us on MONEY FM 89.3!
