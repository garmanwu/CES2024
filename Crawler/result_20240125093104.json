Here\u2019s how it works.\nEspresso's new 17-inch 4K display is the pro-grade portable I've been waiting for\nBring touch and pen control to any computer \u2014 even MacBooks\nWith their Kickstarter origins now well and truly behind them, the Australian portable display pioneers at Espresso Displays are ready to take things up a notch with the arrival of the company's first professional-grade, USB-powered monitor.\nDescribed by its designers as \"The world's most powerful portable display,\" the new Espresso 17 Pro is the company's largest offering to date, boasting a 17.3-inch touchscreen \u2014 a significant leap from its predecessor, the Espresso Display V2, which came in 13 and 15-inch variants.\nOf course, there's more to the Espresso 17 Pro than its screen size \u2014 as its name would suggest, the company's third-generation display is aimed at creatives and professionals, and is said to be the only portable monitor capable of displaying 10-bit color and 100% DCI-P3 color range, making it a reference-quality monitor that's suitable for use in digital cinema production.\nIn addition to this, the Espresso 17 Pro is also the company's first 4K monitor (previous models topped out at 1080p), and is able to reach a peak brightness of 450 nits.\nEspresso 17 Pro: Design\nRecently, I was invited to Espresso Display's HQ in Sydney, Australia to get an early look at the Espresso 17 Pro and\u00a0was surprised by how compact and light the 17.3-inch monitor felt, especially in direct comparison to the 15-inch Espresso Display V2.\nMuch of this can be attributed to the monitor's sleek new design, which has ditched the iMac-style silver chin seen on previous models. If you're familiar with the V2, simply picture the monitor ending right after the black bezel area.\nThat said, there is a slight trade-off in that the Espresso 17 Pro is thicker (0.35-inch / 9mm) than the V2 (0.2-inch / 5.3mm). However, with its larger, brighter 4K display, it's something of a miracle that that the Espresso 17 Pro only weighs 2.4 lbs / 1.1kg \u2014 an increase of just 8.3 ounces / 235g. We can thank its aircraft-grade aluminum body for that.\nDespite all this, what struck me most about the Espresso 17 Pro is how it allowed users to apply touchscreen and pen functionality to any computer or laptop \u2014 even Macs.\nEspresso 17 Pro: Magic touch\nUnlike Microsoft's Surface products, Apple has always resisted touchscreen features in the Mac space. However, the Espresso 17 Pro display gives MacBook users an easy way around this hurdle.\nWhile the Espresso Display V2 already offered a model with basic touch and pen features for use with specific apps, the Espresso 17 Pro takes things a step further with the introduction of the company's new Jot software.\nAvailable as a free download for Espresso 17 Pro users, Jot applies a sort of digital sketchpad over your entire desktop, giving you the ability to annotate and draw over anything on-screen, as well as create screen snips, drag files around and more.\nEspresso 17: Portability\nLike previous models, the Espresso 17 Pro draws its power from your laptop via USB Type-C connection, allowing for an impressive sense of portability.\nIn my brief hands-on time with the new monitor, it occurred to me that its light and portable nature would make it perfect for use with the Samsung DeX feature on my Galaxy Z Fold 5.\nSure enough, connecting the monitor to my foldable via USB-C instantly launched the DeX interface, giving me a complete desktop-style experience \u2014 I don't even have to carry a laptop to take advantage of the Espresso 17 Pro.\nWhile the Z Fold 5 alone wasn't quite enough to power the new 17.3-inch display, requiring additional juice from Espresso's Charge power brick, I was able to use my device as a large trackpad (and even as a touch keyboard), essentially giving me an instant workstation.\nEspresso 17 Pro: Pricing and availability\nGiven its position as a pro-grade offering, it will probably come as no surprise that the Espresso 17 Pro is significantly more expensive than its predecessors, with its pre-order price starting at $999 / \u00a3999 / AU$1,499 for the Essentials Bundle, which includes the display and its new magnetic Stand Pro.\nFor the complete experience, Espresso Displays also offers a Studio Bundle, which is priced at $1,315 / \u00a31,285 / $1,925.\nThe Studio Bundle includes the Espresso 17 Pro and magnetic Stand Pro, which has a sturdy hinge that lets you lay the screen down to that perfect Wacom-style drawing angle. You also get the company's touchscreen-enabled Pen, an official case, a matte screen protector which provides a paper-like texture for drawing, and Charge, which is essentially a 27,000mAh / 99.6Wh battery pack.\nPlease note, while the Charge power bank magnetically attaches to the bottom of the Stand Pro, a USB-C cable is still required to power Espresso 17 Pro.\nFor comparison, the 15-inch 'Touch' version of the Espresso Display V2 is priced at $499 / \u00a3479 / AU$749.\nAvailable to pre-order from Espresso Display's website for release this November, the new Espresso 17 Pro monitor seems like a huge step forward for the Aussie company. Its design, features and technical specs have all received a substantial upgrade, and will surely appeal greatly to creatives looking for a professional-grade monitor that they can travel with.\nThat said, it doesn't come cheap, so portability will have to be a primary concern for anyone opting to buy the Espresso 17 Pro.\nGet the BEST of Tom\u2019s Guide daily right in your inbox: Sign up now!\nUpgrade your life with the Tom\u2019s Guide newsletter.

The fact you can take it with you anywhere is truly a big deal.\nThin and portable are not the most common words used to describe a monitor \u2013 but in the case of the Espresso Display \u2013 they are the only words to describe it.\nThe Espresso Display \u2013 which is an Australian creation \u2013 is a product that\u2019s capable of completely changing your workflow and dramatically increasing your productivity on the move.\nAvailable in 13.3 and 15.6-inch versions, the Espresso Display has a full high definition resolution (1920 x 1080) and is remarkably thin at just 5mm \u2013 that\u2019s thinner than an iPad.\nIt\u2019s made from aeronautical grade aluminium so it not only looks slick \u2013 but it can also handle daily usage on the move.\nUsers can simply plug it into their Windows or Mac computer and extend their screen even further.\nThis alone makes a huge difference to how you can do your work.\nBeing able to spread out your work to a second screen with a laptop is a luxury you don\u2019t usually get to enjoy when you\u2019re on the move or travelling\nWe use an iMac in our office and it\u2019s attached to two other monitors but when we use our MacBook Pro we\u2019ve only got the 16-inch screen.\nWe can use the split screen feature to have two things side by side but it\u2019s a lot more restrictive than having a second screen.\nThis problem has been solved with the Espresso Display.\nFor our review we were using the 15-inch display which has two USB-C ports on the right edge as well as a mini-HDMI port.\nThis means you can connect a laptop with a USB-C cable and either mirror or expand your desktop.\nAnd the best part is that the Espresso Display doesn\u2019t require its own power supply when used with your laptop.\nIt doesn\u2019t have a rechargeable battery \u2013 that would mean it would be a lot thicker than 5mm.\nIt also means you can take it with you \u2013 it\u2019s as portable as it is thin. So it can be packed in with your laptop.\nThe 15-inch Espresso Display easily fit in our backpack with our 16-inch MacBook Pro.\nAnd the display can also work with smartphones.\nIt\u2019s a particularly good fit for Samsung devices which can connect through USB-C and also utilise DeX to give you a desktop experience \u2013 with the addition of a keyboard and mouse.\nFor iPhone users, it\u2019s also possible to mirror your screen but you can\u2019t do much else.\nApple\u2019s Lightning connection is the roadblock here.\nYou need to connect with a Lightning cable to HDMI through a dongle and then to the display fron the dongle with a USB-C cable \u2013 and the display \u00a0will also need its own power surce.\nThere are a few ways for the display support itself. First is with the cover that can also be folded into stand.\nIt\u2019s also possible to also purchase a stand that magnetically attaches to the Espresso Display. This stand also fold down to the size of a CD case so it\u2019s no problem to carry it with you as well.\nThere\u2019s even a VESA mount option as well if you\u2019d prefer a more permanent set up.\nAnd it gets even better for MacBook users. When connected to the MacBook Pro you can install a driver so the Espresso Display can be used as a touchscreen \u2013 that\u2019s a first for a Mac user.\nNow anything you put on the Espresso Display from your MacBook can be moved and navigated by touch.\nWindows laptop users are already used to having a touchscreen at their fingertips and this and can continue with the Espresso Display as a second touchscreen.\nBut one thing a user needs to be mindful of is power consumption.\nRemember when we said the display doesn\u2019t need its own power supply?\nThat\u2019s still true \u2013 but the power has to come from somewhere.\nIn this case the laptop has to power its own screen and system and the Espresso Display as well so it will drain your battery faster.\nSo it might be an idea to keep your charger handy \u2013 or better still to keep it plugged in to power so you\u2019re not caught out.\nThe Espresso Display can also be connected to other devices like gaming consoles and DVD and Blu-ray players.\nIn the case of the PlayStation, users can connect to the Espresso Display with a mini HDMI cable and you can power the display through the console\u2019s USB port with a USB-A to USB-C cable.\nIf you connect to a Blu-ray player you\u2019ll need to used your laptop\u2019s charger through one of the USB-C ports.\nThe product has been funded through Indiegogo and is priced at $399 for the Display 13 and $429 for the Display 15.\nwww.espressodisplays.com\nVERDICT\nThe Espresso Display is a high quality and versatile product that is a game changer for busy users on the go.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nEspressoDisplay Portable Monitor Review\nThe espressoDisplay is an all-inclusive portable monitor for serious work, anywhere.\nTechRadar Verdict\nThe espressoDisplay is, without a doubt, our favorite portable monitor right now. Aptly named, espressoDisplay gives users a boost of productivity anywhere they are working.\nHigh-quality display\nGreat magnetic stand and folio\nResponsive touch display\nSuper thin and minimalist screen\nAccessories are an additional cost\nA screen protector is needed to cut down on glare\nWhy you can trust TechRadar\nWe spend hours testing every product or service we review, so you can be sure you\u2019re buying the best. Find out more about how we test.\nThe espressoDisplay portable monitor is an incredibly flexible display with some impressive features. Cheekily named after the beloved caffeinated beverage as both give a shot of productivity, what I love about this monitor is just how easy it is to use. One cable, one slab of glass similar in size to an iPad, and a choice of accessories to pair. No unnecessary software, no odd attachments, and no need for software (although there is a companion software for extended controls). I chose to compliment my new portable monitor with the Creator bundle and am thrilled with my choice.\nUnboxing and First Impressions\nUnboxing the espressoDisplay wasn't anything too difficult - I opened the boxes and actually thought I was missing something because of the lack of parts. In the main box was a piece of glass and a cable. That is all. Since I chose some additional accessories (sadly, at an additional cost), I quickly unboxed those and got even more excited about my new portable workstation setup.\nI chose to pick up the magnetic stand, the creator screen protector, the folio case, and the pen to complement the display. From the moment they are unboxed, it's evident that all these items are made of top-quality materials and are designed to be durable.\nDesign and Build Quality\nDisplay: 13.3 or 15.6in\nResolution: 1080p\nInputs: 2x USB-C\nWeight: 1.5lb (13-inch model) or 2lb (15-inch model)\nDimensions: 308 x 228 x 0.2mm (13-inch model) or 358 x 256 x 0.2mm (15-inch model)\nThe stand can magnetically attach to the display in any orientation and fold down flat, or expand in a \"Z\" shape to stand up like a monitor, fold down like a drawing surface, or angle to match a workspace.\nThe Creator screen protector adds a matte finish to the Display's glass screen, making it easier to write on and easier to see in direct sunlight. This screen protector pairs wonderfully with the Pen, another great attachment from Espresso.\nThe pen is a stylus accessory designed to compliment the espressoDisplay perfectly, packing a 100-hour battery life and proving an ideal partner for touch, drawing, design, and note-taking. This pen features 4,000 levels of pressure and tilt sensitivity and minimal lag - as a result, it provides a paper-like experience on a glass surface and can function with various operating systems.\nLastly, the espressoCase is a sleek microfiber folio stand that functions as a screen cover (not a case) and stand. One end of this folio magnetically attaches to the Display, and the other part can fold out to create a kickstand allowing the monitor to sit upright with the help of simply the folio, with no stand necessary.\nIn Use\nI have used the espressoDisplay for my portable workstation for weeks and am beyond impressed. I can use this display at the kitchen table, at a proper desk, at a coffee shop, or even on a ping-pong table at a makeshift desk in the middle of the woods at my family cabin/lake house. No matter what scenario I throw at it, this monitor makes the area more productive and conducive to maximum work efficiency. Additionally, its ease of use makes me want to use it more. I want to find times to sneak away to a coffee shop throughout the week, so I have an excuse to use my espressoDisplay.\nWhen I am working on catching up on emails, I will usually throw Slack or some other tool I need to reference on my espressoDisplay in landscape mode. When writing articles like this, I throw reference materials and my notes on this display in portrait mode, with my notes on top and specs from the company on the bottom. This way of using the screen has become my favorite as it feels much larger in portrait than landscape. When working on light photo editing, I like to throw my file browser on there, taking up the entire screen so that I can easily see a preview of my images without opening them up.\nThe stand is fantastic, The folio is super easy and helpful, and now the pen and Creator screen protector. I have been a fan of Paperlike for years since they started. While part of me believes that no screen protector could be as good as Paperlike, this one is about as close as possible. While using the pen with the Creator screen protector, it feels a like I am writing on paper, and what's incredible about this is that I can do it on any application that previously I would have needed to use my iPad to notate with. Now, I can do it all through my MacBook with my espressoDisplay.\nEspresso also has a fantastic companion app called espressoFlow, which gives the user full control of the monitor. So much so it feels like a natural extension of whatever laptop or computer you are using. The three main features that make this incredible are Workspaces, Snap, and Arrangement. Workspaces allow custom screen setups to be triggered with a simple touch across both (or all) of the attached screens. So, if you have a workflow and a way you get certain tasks done, such as emails or scheduling, you can now get started with all needed windows sized the way you need in a moment. Snap is the feature that all Mac users want. It allows windows to easily 'snap' to where you want them to allow for maximum screen usage without accidentally putting some windows off-screen or spending precious time you could be working on resizing the windows perfectly. Lastly, the arrangement feature seamlessly rotates the screen from landscape to portrait just by physically rotating the screen. This, plus the ability to change things like brightness, screen mirror settings, color profile, volume, and rotation lock, makes the espresso display feel like something that should have always been there rather than an extension you need to learn.\nFinal Verdict\nFor those who are going to be drawing or notating, this espressoDisplay is a no-brainer. For nomads who are working on the go, this display is perfect. This monitor is a must for those who are hybrid workers, who work at a dedicated setup, then travel to a different location to continue working.\nThis monitor is fantastic all around, and the only downfall is that the accessories that make this display even better are all additional. For this reason, we suggest getting the bundle with all the accessories.\nFormer TechRadar Pro B2B Hardware Editor, Collin has been in journalism for years, with experience in small and large markets, including Gearadical, DailyBeast, FutureNet, and more.\nSamsung's self-repair program will let you fix TVs, projectors, and soundbars\nOne of the biggest data leaks ever has just been revealed - here's what to do if you've been hit\nDiscord bots are being used in information-stealing campaigns\nBy John LoefflerJanuary 22, 2024\nBy John LoefflerJanuary 22, 2024\nBy Collin ProbstJanuary 22, 2024\nBy Alicia HaddickJanuary 22, 2024\nBy Simon LucasJanuary 21, 2024\nBy James DavidsonJanuary 21, 2024\nBy Karen FreemanJanuary 21, 2024\nBy Ryan WaniataJanuary 20, 2024\nBy Simon LucasJanuary 20, 2024\nBy John LoefflerJanuary 19, 2024\nBy Mirza BahicJanuary 19, 2024\nTechRadar is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.

Espresso has just launched Version 2 \u2013 and it\u2019s even better.\nEspresso entered the market at the start of the pandemic, at a time when we were reassessing how and where we worked.\nTheir thin displays (just 5.3mm thick) offered a solution for those who wanted to break free of their small laptop screens and have more room to move and to get their work done.\nVersion 2 of the Espresso display \u2013 available again in 13-inch and 15-inch \u2013 are now even more versatile.\nThey still connect with a single USB-C cable to your laptop or desktop computer and require no power \u2013 they draw power from the computer they are connected to so there is no need to carry around a second charger or power supply.\nAnd the screen can also be used in any orientation \u2013 landscape and portrait \u2013 to suit what you\u2019re working on or viewing.\nAnd they are touchscreens, which, for Mac users, can completely revolutionise the way they work and use their computer.\nThe touchscreen displays have full HD resolution with 300nits brightness and include features like palm rejection when using the touchscreen and have built-in speakers.\nFor our review, we had our 15-inch Espresso display connected to our 14-inch M1 MacBook Pro and we were able to spread out our work.\nWe had our email on the Espresso display with other applications running on the laptop.\nAnd with gestures we were able to navigate the Espresso display including scrolling our emails and browsers with two fingers.\nWe would have liked to see higher brightness, but we suspect that would mean drawing even more power from your laptop which could impact your battery life if you\u2019re on the move.\nWe\u2019re also expecting a 4K Espresso display in the near future.\nEspresso has also released the EspressoPen \u2013 a precision stylus with pressure sensitivity and excellent responsiveness.\nThis now opens up your options to write and draw and the built-in button offers left and right mouse click functionality.\nEspressoPen really frees users up to be even more creative and productive when working with applications like Sketchbook and the whole line-up of Adobe apps like Illustrator, Photoshop and many more.\nThe pen also works seamlessly with collaborative whiteboard tools like Miro, Figma and Conceptboard.\nEspresso has also released EspressoFlow \u2013 new software for Macs and Windows PC that makes it easier to navigate content, add functionality for EspressoPen and just make the screen work even better with your computer.\nThere are also a range of accessories to help position the display including a case that acts both as a cover to protect the screen when not on use and as a way position the screen.\nThere\u2019s also magnetic stand so you can elevate and tilt the screen so it\u2019s at the right height and the right angle.\nThe Espresso displays are a great addition to your workflow. They make things a lot easier and pave the way to help you become a lot more productive no matter where you are.\nAnd being so thin and light \u2013 and the fact they don\u2019t need their own power source \u2013 you can take them anywhere.\nThe Espresso Displays are priced at $669 (13-inch) and $749 (15-inch). EspressoPen is priced at $119, Espresso Stand is $99 and EspressoCase is $69.\nVERDICT\nThe Espresso Display V2 is a huge improvement over the already brilliant original display and provide even more ways to easily expand your workspace and dramatically improve your workflow and productivity.\nRelated Posts\nStephen is the Tech Guide editor and one of Australia's most respected tech journalists.

        "raw_content": "Select Page\nespresso Displays launches new larger espresso 17 Pro \u2013 and it\u2019s awesome\nPosted by Trevor Long | Oct 10, 2023 | News, Tech\nAussie tech company espresso Displays has announced a brand new product which takes their portable displays to a new level, even a new benchmark. A 17.3 inch ultra-thin standalone portable display.\nCalled the espresso 17 Pro, it\u2019s more than just a bigger screen. Following on from their 13 and 15 inch models, the 17.3 adds some serious quality to the range.\n4K UHD resolution plus a 1 billion colour 10 bit spectrum there\u2019s no holding back on this one.\nAnd, like it\u2019s predecessors, it all works on a single USB-C connection to your laptop.\nWill Scuderi, cofounder and CEO at espresso Displays says \u201cespresso\u00a017 Pro is meticulously crafted to support professionals and creatives who need to perform at their best, wherever their work takes them and whatever platforms they use,\u201d\n\u201cEvery aspect of\u00a0espresso\u00a017 Pro has been developed and refined to produce an unrivalled experience and helps people deliver their best work, whatever the task.\u201d\nThe company has had great success with their first few products, but they are still small enough to have a strong loyalty with their customers which allows them to gather outstanding feedback \u2013 all of which has gone into this new product.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve listened intently to how people work today and where work trends are evolving. Our innovation responds directly to what we see and hear from our customers, partners, and collaborators, which is why our products do not sit within the confines of traditional tech product categories.\u201d Scuderi adds.\nThe software that pairs with espresso Displays to control the touch-screen capabilities has been completely re-engineered to allow for a more pro-level experience, plus, the company has created an all-new software called Jot by espresso.\nThis new software allows you to integrate touch into your existing apps. So for example, in a demonstration I watched with my own eyes at the company\u2019s Sydney head-office, working in a Google Document in the cloud, we put a line break in then initiated Jot with the espresso Stylus. Draw a venn diagram or sketch and you can just insert it directly into the document.\nHard to describe, just wait till we get to review it.\nIn addition to great size and quality, the new 17 Pro drops the chin at the bottom of the screen making it a more efficient use of space, and meaning you can still take this one in your backpack.\nThe new Stand Pro allows you to stand your 17 Pro espresso Display next to your PC on the go or at your desk, but also drops down to a secure supported 18 degree angle \u2013 perfect for drawing.\nFor those who like to draw, the espresso Creator is a paper-feel screen cover that means when you sketch on screen you get the feeling of paper not glass.\nAnd of course, the folio protector is a great way to protect the screen, but also act as a simple kick stand.\nIn addition to those, there\u2019s an all-new power supply available from espresso.\nThe espresso Charge is a battery pack that is designed to work with the Stand Pro and sit under it, but it can be used alongside it also. A single USB-C port for charge and output allows you to throw charge into the display to get the full brightness, or charge your laptop while the laptop powers and controls the Display.\nIt\u2019s a 27,000mAh battery, so \u2013 plenty of juice on the go.\nEspresso 17 Pro will be $1,499 when it goes on sale, but is available in a cracking bundle for pre-sale in which you\u2019ll get all the accessories for $1,924, or the screen and just the stand for the screen price of $1,499 \u2013 so it pays to pre-order.\nPre-orders start today, shipping in late November.\nespresso\u00a017 Pro techs and specs:\nShare:\nAbout The Author\nTrev is a Technology Commentator, Dad, Speaker and Rev Head.\nHe produces and hosts two popular podcasts, EFTM and Two Blokes Talking Tech.

By generating a remarkable 480 frames per second, the 27-inch 480Hz QHD gaming OLED panel provides the optimal gaming experience with its smooth and sharp visuals, even during fast screen transitions.\nThe 34- and 39-inch panels offer an ultra-wide (21:9) aspect ratio\u00a0for an immersive gaming experience, while the 31.5-inch panel supports a clear UHD (3840\u00d72160) resolution that makes it suitable not only for gaming but also for office work and content consumption.\nLG Display\u2019s gaming OLED panels include millions of self-emitting pixels without a separate backlight source to boast high refresh rates and resolutions, as well as a fast response time of 0.03ms. In addition, the company has incorporated \u2018META Technology\u2019 into its OLED gaming displays to further enhance the overall image quality while minimizing external light reflections during darker scenes.\nFurthermore, LG Display will present its full lineup of Transparent OLEDs, including the 30-, 55-, and 77-inch displays, to present new shopping experiences to retail spaces by creating unique applications through the use of mid-sized and ultra-large Transparent OLED panels.\nAs the world\u2019s only manufacturer of Transparent OLED, LG Display maximizes OLED\u2019s self-emissive nature to achieve a transparency rate high enough to seamlessly replace glass windows, portray accurate color expression, and provide design flexibility that boosts space utilization.\nTransparent OLEDs are also suitable for indoor use thanks to their lower heat generation compared to conventional LEDs, while their versatility allows for installation in almost all spaces and interiors such as windows, walls, and floors of various sizes.\nIn its West Hall booth, LG Display will showcase its ultra-large \u2018Pillar-to-Pillar (P2P)\u2019 display solution optimized for Software Defined Vehicles (SDV), which utilize the company\u2019s differentiated automotive display technologies such as P-OLED, ATO (Advanced Thin OLED), and LTPS (Low-Temperature Polysilicon) LCD.\nThe \u2018Ultra-large P2P P-OLED\u2019 seamlessly integrates a \u201812.3-inch P-OLED\u2019 dashboard display and \u201934-inch P-OLED\u2019 center screen to create a sleek, sophisticated design that covers the entire dashboard as a large singular display. Meanwhile, the \u201948-inch P2P LTPS LCD\u2019 boasts an expansive screen that allows drivers and passengers to see useful driving information while enjoying entertainment features.\nWith the emergence of large displays like P2P, LG Display is also introducing its \u2018Switchable Privacy Mode (SPM),\u2019 which effectively keeps the driver\u2019s focus on the road by controlling the passenger display\u2019s viewing angle.\nLG Display will also showcase solutions that maximize space efficiency within the limited confines of a vehicle while offering new in-car experiences, including the \u201817-inch Foldable OLED\u2019 designed for RSE (Rear Seat Entertainment) and the \u201818-inch Slidable OLED\u2019 that is hidden in the ceiling and can be extended downwards for use.\nIn addition, the company\u2019s differentiated \u2018Thin Actuator Sound Solution\u2019, which is just 30 percent of the weight and 10 percent of the thickness of a conventional car speaker, can be installed in various areas inside the vehicle, such as the display, ceiling, and floor, for a richer, more 3D immersive sound experience.\nMoreover, LG Display will present cutting-edge technologies engineered to make spaces more aesthetically pleasing, such as an \u2018Under Display\u2019 that conceals the cameras installed on the display by adjusting the overall transparency, and \u2018Decorative Film\u2019 that allows screens to resemble interior materials such as wood or carbon when inactive.\nBy unveiling display solutions that unlock new experiences for global consumers, LG Display plans to strengthen its business competitiveness even further and secure potential customers through its differentiated products and technologies.\nRelated Posts\nLG Display and Mercedes-Benz Forge Cooperation to Elevate Premium Automotive Displays\nLG Display\u2019s Gaming OLED video series hits 100 million views\nLG Display\u2019s domestic plants obtain \u2018Zero Waste to Landfill\u2019 verification from UL Solutions\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2021 LG DISPLAY CO., LTD.\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2024 LG DISPLAY CO., LTD.

This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

        "raw_content": "Coffee News: Bosch teases new super automatic espresso machines at CES\nSomething is brewing!\nSo says the landing page for a preview of new super automatic espresso machines made by Bosch.\nThe German conglomerate took advantage of the CES trade show not only to release some details (Business Wire press release on Yahoo! Finance), but also to announce the new line was a \u201cCES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree.\u201d A promising start for the forthcoming products.\nDubbed the 800 Series, Bosch didn\u2019t reveal full specs yet, or even pricing, but the company did highlight a few key features worth noting including:\nOver on the Bosch web site you can find some photos of the upcoming machines (see below). From what I can tell, there\u2019s am attachable carafe that sits on the left which will be used to make milk-based espresso drinks such as Lattes, Latte Macchiatos and Cappuccinos \u2014 similar to what competitors like Philips offers with the LatteGo.\nUp top on the front panel sits a pretty looking 5\u2033 display. It looks like Bosch has really worked carefully on UI design. Of course this could be AI/CGI rendered at this point, but if this is indicative of the final result, the display will have modern graphics with slick visual representations of each beverage.\nA nifty option that should appeal to households with a variety of tastes is the option to brew different coffee grinds. Bosch says a second container can be purchased for different grounds. Presumably this would mean you could have decaf beans as an alternative. Hard to say for sure the details, but it sounds like this is a possibility and we\u2019ll know more in the coming months on the specifics here.\nFinally, upon inspection of the lead photo of the Bosch 800 Series espresso machine I notice the water tank. Integrated into the right side, it sits flush with the unit. At this point we don\u2019t know if there\u2019ll be some sort of filtration system, but I\u2019d wager that it will as the competition mostly do, and it helps preserve the longevity of the brew unit and other internals.\nRELATED:\nAgain, no idea about price. But we can guess! I\u2019d say the two most likely at-home espresso machine competitors are Jura (Switzerland) and Miele (Germany). Comparable machines, say the S8 and CM6160, retail for $2,899 and $2,300 USD respectively. So that should give us some idea. Given Bosch is positioned as a premium brand with aspirational branding/marketing I would not expect to see these things sell at the Philips LatteGo level (which are quite good value). Instead expect up-market products with up-market prices to match.\nBosch says to look for the new 800 Series fully-automatic espresso machines in Spring of 2024.\nCULTURE\nLIFESTYLE\nFILMMAKING/TECH\nATELIER STARK FILMS"
