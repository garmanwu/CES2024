        "raw_content": "Taiwanese AI Robotics Startup Nuwa Secures $6 Million in Series B Funding\nThis new funding round will drive expansion into various service sectors and global markets, as the company seeks to capitalize on a rapidly growing demand for robot-as-a-service solutions.\nNuwa Robotics, a leading Taiwanese AI robotics company, has raised approximately $6 million in Series B funding led by Foxconn. The new capital brings Nuwa's total funding to date to $16.26 million and values the company at $80 million.\nNuwa Robotics develops AI-powered service robots for education, healthcare, manufacturing, and other industries. Its flagship product is the Kebbi educational robot, which is used by over 1,000 schools globally. The success of Kebbi has led to an impressive annual revenue exceeding $3 million since its founding in 2016. Nuwa has since expanded its product line to include into \"cross-domain service robots\" for uses like elderly care and last-mile delivery and \"smart manufacturing\" industrial robots.\nThe company will use the new funding to further develop its AI software and hardware capabilities. Nuwa also aims to expand internationally, targeting markets like Japan, Korea, Southeast Asia, and North America. The company plans to grow its team, hiring additional AI engineers as well as sales, marketing, and support roles.\nThe rise of robot-as-a-service (RaaS) offerings has been accelerated by a worldwide labor shortage and the increasing capabilities of AI technologies. A recent industry report by Nissho Global predicts the global RaaS market to reach $44 billion by 2028. Nuwa Robotics has already introduced its own RaaS platform, named \"NUWA Roflow\", to facilitate low-threshold, no-code development. With their new KebbiGPT AI, the company has also integrated Azure OpenAI to enable richer personalities and interactive experiences for its robotic products.\n\"We see service robots becoming an extension of human employees, addressing labor shortages while also upgrading service quality,\" said Guo Liuzong, Founder and CEO of Nuwa Robotics. \"This funding enables us to keep innovating and bring the benefits of AI robotics to more customers globally.\"\nNuwa Robotics has already begun making inroads into diverse sectors.

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nMy Top 10 Revolutionary Discoveries At CES 2024: AI, Robotics, Web3\nLisa Martin and Sandy Carter on CES Live\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is more than an event; it's a crystal ball into the technological marvels that will shape our world in the next half-decade. This year's CES, a melting pot of over 135,000 technology enthusiasts and innovators, showcased over 4,300 exhibits that spanned the spectrum of human ingenuity.\nHere's a snapshot of my top ten groundbreaking favorites:\nThe FQ Women Walk the Floor\nThe event at CES by Female Quotient was a powerful testament to women's growing influence in technology. It provided a platform where a diverse group of leaders \u2013 from visionary C-Suite executives to groundbreaking female founders and tech giants \u2013 converged to share their insights. They discussed strategies and initiatives aimed at narrowing the gender gap within the industry.\nWomen Walk the Floor at CES\n\u201cWe are all about creating a space and culture where we all feel welcome and like we belong. Here we all are walking the CES floor together, the most amazing thing we could possibly imagine because a woman alone has power but collectively, we have impact.\" - Shelley Zalis, Founder & CEO of The Female Quotient at the 2024 Women Walk the Floor Tour at CES. This is a significant milestone in our journey toward a more inclusive industry, making it a crucial highlight of my list.\nHydrogen Powered 18-Wheelers (or Class 8 Semi-Trucks)\nThe convention center was abuzz with the sight of Nikola 's Class 8 zero-emission truck, a progressive innovation that marks a new chapter in sustainable transport with hydrogen-powered fuel cells. The zero-emission semi-trucks, with a remarkable range of up to 500 miles, signify a leap towards a greener future. Pedro Garcia's insights on their developmental journey, which included extensive applications of the virtual world of Altair's simulations and data analytics tools, provided a fascinating narrative on how these behemoths transitioned from digital prototypes to the tarmac. \u201c\"At CES, as the industry discussed hydrogen's role in the future of transportation, the sight of the Nikola hydrogen fuel cell electric truck in action on the roads around the convention center affirmed 2024 promises to be a pivotal year for the transportation industry and especially Nikola,\" said Pedro Garcia, Nikola Global Head of Product Development. \"In showcasing the operational capabilities of our Class 8 zero-emission truck that is in production and being delivered to customers, we brought the future to life. Here's to an inspiring journey ahead, as we contribute to a more sustainable and innovative tomorrow.\" This innovation is a harbinger of the hydrogen economy, securing its spot on my list.\nPedro Garcia in front of the Nikola Hydrogen Powered 18 Wheeler at CES\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023\nDeep Orange 14 from Clemson University\nThis year, the Deep Orange 14 autonomous vehicle, a product of Clemson University's bright minds, was a beacon of hope for disaster-stricken areas. The collaboration with the U.S. Army culminated in a vehicle that can navigate treacherous terrains to deliver aid without endangering human lives. This marvel of engineering, with over 900 parameters under constant surveillance, is at the forefront of autonomous research and deserves its acclaim for pushing the boundaries of technology for the greater good.\nDeep Orange 14 from Clemson University\nFlux Web3 Decentralized Cloud\nAmidst the clamor for genuine decentralization, the Flux Cloud emerged as a paradigm shift for developers seeking to build on a truly decentralized web3 infrastructure. This platform is a cornerstone for future applications, promising an escape from the centralized grip of web2. According to Blockworks, more of the world\u2019s largest Web2 game companies will embrace web3 in 2024. And per web3 statistics, projections indicate that the web3 industry could reach a valuation of approximately $14.5 trillion by 2030 and up to $11 trillion by 2024. Its potential for enhancing scalability, flexibility, and censorship resistance is why it's a key feature of my list.\nFlux Cloud at CES\nTransparent TVs by LG\nThe magic of LG's Signature OLED T was easily seen as it seamlessly transitioned between transparency and vivid display in the midst of ooos and ahhs! This year, LG's promise to commercialize the 77-inch wonder is a bold step towards redefining the aesthetic of living spaces. It's a statement of elegant functionality and serves as a window to a world where technology and design converge in harmony. Its inclusion on my list is due to its visionary approach to home entertainment.\nTransparent TV with Sandy Carter, COO\nAI from Pets to Pores to Pebbles\nAI's omnipresence at CES was emphatically showcased in applications ranging from pet health to personal wellness. The Invoxia Minitailz struck a chord with pet lovers, offering a glimpse into the well-being of our furry companions through advanced biometric tracking. Meanwhile, the Calm Stone's novel approach to stress reduction through AI-assisted breathing exercises represented a new frontier in personal health tech. In addition, Loreal introduced the Giorgio Armani Meta Profiler. The Meta Profiler's use of AI for analyzing skin health was another standout, illustrating AI's potential to tailor and enhance the retail experience. This diverse application of AI across various facets of life is why it's integral to my list.\nThe Calm Stone\nRobotics in Pools and PT\nRobotics were everywhere too! \u201cLanguage models aren\u2019t just for IoT anymore. Given the ease with which interfaces like ChatGPT can interpret prompts into commands, there will be a new class of tools emerging that seeks to combine the best of natural language processing and perception hardware,\u201d said Brandon Minor, co-founder and CEO of Tangram Vision said while speaking to the Robot Report. \u201cThis feels like a natural extension from an engineer\u2019s point of view, and success would add a layer of \u2018magic\u2019 to any tech demo.\u201d And we saw some magic too! The Aiper Scuba Series redefines pool maintenance with its cordless robotic cleaners. But in the robotics area, what caught my attention at CES was WiRobotics. This nifty device acts like a mini exoskeleton for your lower body, providing subtle, motorized assistance that helps with walking.\nYong-Jae Kim - Founder, CEO - WIRobotics and Sandy Carter, COO Unstoppable\nIts design is cleverly intuitive\u2014a belt pack equipped with retractable robotic arms that support and enhance leg movements. It's a godsend for physical therapy patients, aiding in movement and improving balance without being obtrusive. When I tested it, the difference was noticeable; my strides felt lighter and I was able to walk with increased speed. Priced at $2,300, the WiRobotics is an investment in health, claiming to reduce the energy required for walking by 20%. It's a standout addition to my list because of its potential to revolutionize recovery times, making it an essential tool for those on the path to regaining their mobility.\nThe Emergence of AI Companionship \u2013 Introducing Wehead\nAt this year's CES, a notable innovation was introduced by an American startup: Wehead. This groundbreaking AI companion robot presents a human-like face on a screen, forging a new frontier in digital interaction. My experience with Wehead was remarkable, engaging in conversation with an AI that seemed almost human. The developers designed it with a noble purpose: to offer companionship to those who might feel isolated or lonely.\nReflecting on George Ritzer's analysis in 'The McDonaldization of Society', Wehead stands in stark contrast to the impersonal automation that has come to define modern services, like those of fast-food chains, which expedite efficiency at the cost of human interaction.\nWeHead - Virtual Companion\nWehead aims to restore some of that lost connection, providing a 'face' and a 'voice' in scenarios where human contact is scarce. It's a poignant response to the social isolation prevalent in our fast-paced world and represents a meaningful use of technology to enhance human connection.\nThis is why Wehead has earned a place on my list \u2013 it's not just about the technology itself, but about how it can serve to alleviate the loneliness that touches so many lives.\nLongevity with the Phantom Neo by Bodyfriend\nThe Phantom Neo massage chair by BODYFRIEND represents a leap in health and wellness technology. By integrating PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) technology, this chair doesn't just offer relaxation but a daily therapeutic regimen, potentially extending the 'Healthy Life Year' of users. Its revolutionary approach to daily well-being is why it's featured on my list.\nBodyfriend\nVirtual Content Creation.\nSony turned my head at CES with its integration of Smode XR technology. Smode XR harnesses the power of extended reality (XR) to meld the physical with the virtual, opening up a world of possibilities for virtual production shoots and live events. I saw a mini movie being made with real-time compositing, integrating to create stunningly immersive virtual environments, showcasing video of larger views than were shown in a real life picture. The potential of Smode XR in transforming television production, film, and live performances is immense, promising a new era of entertainment that is as limitless as the imagination of its creators. This innovation made my list because I think that creators are the future economy!\nThe Future of Content Production\nInnovate.\nAt the end of CES 2024 , these ten innovations stand as beacons of progress, each with the potential to redefine aspects of our lives. However, my iphone is filled with so many innovations from too many companies to mention. From fostering diversity to propelling sustainable transportation, from enhancing personal health to providing companionship, the future is being shaped today.\nAnd as I reflect on the showcases that left an indelible mark on me, I'm filled with anticipation for what the next year's CES will reveal about our path forward. You must join me next year!"

Its latest robot Kebbi Air provides a creative way for increasing kids' motivation to learn.\nAn official statement by NUWA Robotics conveyed: \"It is our belief that, through day-to-day interactions, the relationship between humans and robots will become more emotionally and intellectually profound. AI and body language will enhance the reality and intimacy of human-robot interactions, and robots will become not just tools or devices but reliable assistants and friends with whom you can share all your thoughts and feelings.\"\nKebbi, equipped with a computer monitor screen that displays learning materials, videos, and games, brings heartwarmingly interactive innovation to the educational market. Kebbi was designed to act as a teacher and playmate for young children. The robot can entertain children with singing and dancing.\nKebbi Air has a built-in STEAM-based education program that further improves on the previous version in terms of software structure and user experience.\n\"We made the second-generation Kebbi more user friendly, and added more development tools for our customers so they can produce their own content with our robot,\" remarked NUWA CEO Leo Guo.\nSocial interaction innovation in Kebbi\nKebbi Air features facial and speech recognition for recognizing and interacting with other members of the family. Children can do coding on their own with the assistance of machine intelligence.\nThe need for educational robots like Kebbi Air will increase as kids continue to stay at home during the COVID-19 pandemic. NUWA has built an augmented product with a temperature sensor attached to Kebbi Air to detect people's body temperature.\nThe second-generation Kebbi Air will likely surpass its initial sale of 10,000 models in 2019 according to the company.\nEnglish Tutor\nWith its one-to-one conversation functionality, Kebbi may be used as an English tutor with the ability to correct learners when they are having difficulty pronouncing an English word.\nKebbi includes English teaching videos, engaging animations, and interesting stories that make learning easy and stress-free. Its study guide includes thematic one-to-one exercises and delicate body-movement guidance that help users improve concentration and enhance learning effects.\nFounded in 2016 and headquartered in Taipei, Taiwan, NUWA Robotics Corp. is poised to change the way children study and learn, especially in today's \"new normal\". NUWA has partnered with Foxconn and Xiaomi Corp. to expand further in Taiwan, Japan, and China. Recognizing and working to assist NUWA's future business development, Taiwan Tech Arena (TTA) selected NUWA Robotics to join the roster of 100 featured Taiwanese startups showcased at CES 2021.\nKebbi is the brainchild of NUWA CEO Leo Guo. His idea was to create a social companion to keep his daughter company. Guo has over 20 years of experience in the IT industry, and has previously worked for Softbank, Foxconn, and Pegatron.\nGuo has been the heart and soul of NUWA ever since it was founded, and he is highly committed to continue incorporating robots into modern society. He leads NUWA's engineering and product design teams in the development of AI and smart robots and in creating new, smart devices that improve the quality of life.\nThe NUWA team has over 15 years of experience with consumer electronic design and the development of manufacturing processes, and team leaders are highly motivated, with prior leadership experience in large technology companies such as Quanta and Foxconn.\nCES 2021 TTA-VR Pavilion: https://pse.is/3brhj2\nView original content:http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ces-2021-nuwas-robot-innovates-learning-with-social-interaction-301206533.html\nSOURCE\nNUWA Robotics Corp.\nIndices\nCommodities\nCurrencies\nStocks"
