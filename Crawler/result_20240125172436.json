Improve lives.\n12 emerging trends for 2024\n2024 will be a pivotal year for psychology\nThe U.S. presidential campaign, already infected with misinformation, needs psychological science\u2019s debunking and prebunking strategies. Generative artificial intelligence\u2014unleashed upon society with few guardrails\u2014will desperately require social science insights as it progresses along its exciting and uncertain trajectory.\nThe ongoing crisis in mental health care access, the trauma for women and LGBTQ+ individuals whose bodily autonomy is threatened by ongoing legislation, and the backlash against racial equity work present unprecedented challenges and opportunities over the next year. There is hope though as mental health technology enters a second wave of investment, clinicians continue to innovate to reach more patients, new strategies to end addiction make promising headway, and neuroscience helps us to discover ways to protect brain health and treat brutal afflictions like Alzheimer\u2019s.\nJoin us in exploring these 12 trends.\nThis election year, fighting misinformation is messier and more important than ever\nPsychologists are using science communication to set the record straight. But it's ugly out there.\nWhat psychologists need to know about the evolution of generative AI\nPsychologists are exploring how this new technology can simplify or amplify their efforts\u2014and leading the charge to bring behavioral insights into the creation and deployment of generative AI tools.\nHigher education is struggling. Psychologists are navigating its uncertain future\nPolicymakers are taking aim at women and LGBTQ+ individuals\nPsychologists persevere in EDI work despite growing backlash against racial equity efforts\nMore than three years after pledges to increase racial diversity, the story on the ground is far less optimistic than many had hoped.\nMental health care is in high demand. Here\u2019s how psychologists are leveraging technology and their peers to meet the need\nAmid a shortage of mental health providers, digital therapeutics could play an important role in providing support for underserved communities.\nWhat do people really want in their work? Meaning and stability\nWidespread volatility is strengthening employee resolve to advocate for security, purpose, and well-being on the job.\nPsychologists are innovating to tackle substance use by building new alliances in treatment efforts\nNew interventions are improving chances of recovery from addictions.\nThere\u2019s a strong push for more school psychologists\nA combination of pre-existing shortages and a rise in school stressors has led to a major effort to train and hire more mental health professionals for school settings.\nMonetizing mental health is harder than it looks\nAfter several years of rapid growth of mental health technology companies, a slew of high-profile layoffs and ethical breaches are spurring better clinical and business practices.\nWhat\u2019s ahead for clinical practice?\nAs telehealth settles into a new normal, new policies around reimbursement and data privacy are still being hammered out.\nPsychology is improving brain health and aging\nResearchers are developing new interventions that can help prevent, identify, and manage cognitive decline."

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.
