        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Remember Motorola? Its Chinese owner wants it to be the world\u2019s third-largest mobile brand by 2027\nMotorola once led the mobile phone market, with its chic flip phones like the Motorola Razr. But, like many of its contemporaries, the phonemaker lost out to smartphones from companies like Apple, Samsung, and a host of Chinese brands. Now the Chinese tech company Lenovo, which bought Motorola from Google in 2014, thinks the brand is prime for a big comeback.\n\u201cI would bet a paycheck that in three years we will be number three around the world,\u201d Matthew Zielinski, executive vice-president for Lenovo, told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos. Lenovo has \u201chyper-prioritized\u201d Motorola, a decision that\u2019s now paying off, he said.\nCurrently, the top two brands in the smartphone market are Apple and Samsung; a recent report from market intelligence firm IDC gives them 20.1% and 19.4% market share respectively. Two Chinese brands, Xiaomi and Oppo, come in third and fourth place respectively.\nCounterpoint Research, another market intelligence firm, puts Samsung in first place with 20% market share, based on data up to the third quarter of 2023. Apple comes in second with 16%, followed by Oppo and Xiaomi.\nWhile the firm doesn\u2019t list Motorola in the top five, it does note the brand reported double-digit growth last year. And Motorola may be doing well in individual markets, coming in second in Latin America, according to publicly available data from Canalys and Counterpoint. The brand is in third in the U.S., according to Counterpoint.\nWhat happened to Motorola?\nMotorola\u2019s market share peaked in 2006, when IDC put it at second place behind Nokia. That was the year before the launch of the iPhone, and since then the company has lost ground to Apple and Samsung. Critics point to Motorola\u2019s slow reaction to changing consumer needs, whether turning the phone to a business device like the Blackberry, or the rise of smartphone apps.\nMotorola then split into two companies in 2010: Motorola Mobility, which housed the company\u2019s consumer electronics division, and Motorola Solutions, which makes telecommunications equipment. (Motorola Solutions has managed to turn things around under CEO Greg Brown due, in part, to a brisk business in public safety technology)\nGoogle bought Motorola for $12.5 billion in August 2011, only to offload the company to Lenovo three years later for just $2.9 billion.\nThe current-day Motorola is now banking on foldable smartphones, bringing back its Razr brand. The latest version of the RAZR costs less than $1000, making it cheaper that Samsung\u2019s foldable offering.\nThe Latest\n\u00a9 2023 Fortune Media IP Limited. All Rights Reserved.

        "raw_content": "Android Police\nHere's a closer look at Motorola's first budget phone of 2024\nThe Moto G Play (2024) gets the pre-launch leak treatment\nSummary\nWhile flagship phones capture most of the tech world's attention, there's a large market for budget and midrange devices across the globe. While companies like Samsung have a foothold in this segment thanks to its A series of phones, brands like Motorola aren't too behind, as we saw with the Moto G Play (2023). The Lenovo-owned manufacturer is now gearing up to release a successor to this sub-$200 phone, with leaked renders beginning to pop up.\nThese renders come courtesy of famed leaked Onleaks working in collaboration with Czech publication Smartmania (via Phone Arena). A quick look at the rear panel of this upcoming midranger reveals that it will house just one camera, supposedly a 50MP Quad Pixel unit, whereas the Moto G Play (2023) features three rear sensors. The Moto G Play (2024) also gets a generously sized space for the LED flash just below the solitary rear camera.\nOn top of these high-quality renders detailing the Moto G Play (2024) from all angles, Smartmania also managed to obtain some info on the phone's hardware. The same 6.5-inch screen is said to be retained on the upcoming successor but with an FHD+ resolution, up from the predecessor's more basic HD+. Meanwhile, the refresh rate will supposedly remain unchanged at 90Hz, which should be decent for a budget phone.\nThere's some uncertainty over the make of the processor going into the Moto G Play (2024), but the source says it will be a Qualcomm unit this time, replacing the 12nm MediaTek Helio G37 chip seen on its 2023 counterpart. While the predecessor lacked 5G connectivity, there's some hope that the 2024 iteration would support it, although there's no confirmation of this at the moment.\nThe 3.5mm headphone jack is also back, giving users the option to plug in their headphones the old-fashioned way. Motorola is also sticking to the same 5,000mAh battery underneath, per the source, potentially offering a day or more of usage on a full charge. Unfortunately, the older Android 13 could be the software of choice for the Moto G Play (2024), though Smartmania predicts an update to Android 14 could be on the cards.\nA design change worth pointing out is the relocation of the fingerprint scanner from the back panel to the side-mounted power button. Much like the 2023 version, Motorola's first budget phone of the new year will also make it to the US, reportedly at the same $170 price tag. While it could be available in multiple colorways, the leak could only confirm the Sapphire Blue model.\nThe G Play 2023 is Moto's long overdue update to the Moto G Play 2021. This is for those who need a solid device and are sticking to a tight budget. Despite some compromises, the Moto G Play (2023) is one of the best sub-$150 phones you can get today.\nSubscribe to our Newsletters!\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nChethan Rao is a news writer at Android Police, primarily focusing on weekend news coverage for the site.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES: Motorola looks to bridge PC, smartphone experiences with new product lineup\nLAS VEGAS - Motorola Mobility has raised the bar on mobile computing, announcing four new Android-based products during a presentation at the Consumer Electronics Show today. The company showcased three new smartphones - the Atrix 4G for AT&T, the Cliq 2 with MotoBlur for T-Mobile and the Droid Bionic for Verizon Wireless.\nEach of the devices is a potential game changer, not necessarily because they're the latest and greatest in smartphones but more because the company seems to have listened to consumers about what the features, the tools and the specs they're looking for these days. \"Innovation is the key to differentiating ourselves,\" he told a standing room only crowd at the company's late afternoon press conference here.\nSure, we still refer to these devices as \"phones,\" but company Chairman and CEO Sanjay Jha repeatedly referred to them as devices for mobile computing.\nThat's probably a better description, seeing how the key features being played up were the advanced features such as 1080p HD video, HDMI outputs, dual core processors for improved multi-tasking and most importantly, a powerful and secure platform for enterprise applications.\nMost impressive was the Atrix, which is compatible with a laptop dock station that turns the phone into an actual laptop computer. During the demo, the phone was attached to the rear of this laptop - which has no on-board processor, memory or hard drive but does include a full keyboard and display - and magically transformed into a full laptop experience. He said:\nThis is like nothing you've seen before... the integration between smartphone and computing environment is one in the same.\nJha wrapped up his presentation with the introduction of a fourth product - a 4G tablet computer called Xoom, which will run on Google's Android 3.0 operating system, known as Honeycomb. The company was quick to acknowledge that the tablet, as well as Honeycomb, aren't quite ready yet (which means we won't have a hands-on experience at the Motorola booth on the expo floor later this week.)\nThe company offered a peek at what the Xoom will look like via a nicely produced video. And while it looks promising, it's hard to give a thumbs up or thumbs down to a product we can't touch and tap yet - just like the announced launch of Research in Motion's Playbook tablet. Still, calling it \"our most competitive device in the marketplace,\" he said it will be available as a 3G product in the first quarter and upgradable to 4G in the second quarter.\nRelated\nHow to create a passkey for your Google account (and why you should)\nHow to write better ChatGPT prompts in 5 steps\nIs Temu legit?

Yet for the 2024 edition, held from January 9 through 12, automakers scaled back their introductions of concept and production cars at the world\u2019s largest tech conference and exhibition, intensifying their focus on the products and services beneath the sheet metal, such as artificial intelligence (AI), connectivity, and software-driven machines. In other words, CES is now as much about what\u2019s driving the vehicle experience as what we\u2019re driving (or in some cases, flying). Here are our highlights.\nHonda 0 Saloon\nThe more captivating of the two concepts unveiled by the monumental Japanese conglomerate Honda, the Saloon gives off wedge-shaped 1970s supercar vibes for the electric era. The Saloon and its boxier counterpart, dubbed the Space Hub, comprise the Honda 0\u00a0Series, which premieres a new design language as well as a new EV platform that will reportedly underpin a production car in 2026.\nA thin lighting signature frames the front end with an illuminated \u201cH\u201d logo in the center. The interior features a yoke-style steering wheel and sustainable materials. While Honda is short on specifics, the company says the production car based on the Saloon will feature next-generation automated driving features as well as connected services and advanced AI that will learn drivers\u2019 behaviors.\nMBUX Virtual Assistant\nMercedes-Benz showed off its MBUX Virtual Assistant, which will run on the marque\u2019s forthcoming, in-house-built MB.OS operating system. The system uses advanced, real-time graphics (powered by the same technology as in video games) and generative AI for a more comprehensive and easier-to-use interface. During a roundtable discussion, which included Robb Report, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s chief technical officer, Markus Sch\u00e4fer, stated that \u201cthe car is no longer a car. It\u2019s about creating a new relationship to your vehicle.\u201d\nSoon to be expected with the new MB.OS will be productivity apps such as Zoom, as well as entertainment options like Angry Birds. Unlike BMW, which will charge customers extra for its connected content, Mercedes currently has no plans to institute a subscription model, at least according to Sch\u00e4fer.\nMBUX Sound Drive\nIn other Mercedes news, Mercedes-AMG launched Sound Drive. The app, created with help from Will.i.am, is triggered by driver inputs such as throttle, steering, and brake. On a test drive with the musician, we heard a handful of specific songs\u2014modified especially for the feature\u2014respond to our throttle with a digital revving sound complemented with multi-dimensional flourishes when we turned the wheel.\nIt\u2019s a creative way to capitalize on the quiet cabin afforded by electric cars, replacing the soundtrack of a combustion engine with enhanced music. The feature will be available on Mercedes-Benz and Mercedes-AMG production models equipped with the new MB.OS.\nVolkswagen\u2019s Voice-Activated Digital Assistant\nVolkswagen debuted a new version of its voice-activated digital assistant, which is powered by Chat GPT. The result is touted to be enhanced functionality and more natural language recognition. During a demo, we heard the new assistant suggest nearby restaurants, answer questions about the chairman of a competing car company, and create a bedtime story.\nThe latest system is slated to appear on VW\u2019s electric cars (ID.7, ID.4, ID.5, and ID.3), as well as the new Tiguan and Passat, in the second quarter of this year. Currently, the technology has only been confirmed for VW models, but we suspect similar tech might expand to the Volkswagen Group\u2019s luxury nameplates such as Audi, Bentley, Porsche, and possibly even Lamborghini.\nQualcomm\u2019s Concept Car\nWhile Qualcomm isn\u2019t making cars itself, the tech giant is a crucial supplier to some of the world\u2019s biggest automakers, including BMW, Mercedes, and Jaguar Land Rover, enabling features like in-car connectivity, telematics, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The many non-automotive partners for Qualcomm\u2019s products and connected solutions include Amazon Music, Bose, and TikTok.\nAt CES, Qualcomm\u2019s concept car showcased the company\u2019s AI-powered voice assistant and other connectivity features built on its Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit platform. Also announced was its Snapdragon Satellite, which will bring satellite-based, two-way messaging to next-generation Android phones. The collaboration with navigation-specialist Garmin will enable emergency messaging when a cell signal isn\u2019t available.\nBMW\u2019s Remote Valet\nBMW showed off its Remote Valet self-parking feature, which enables cars to search for spaces and park themselves autonomously in areas equipped to support the technology. Alternatively, drivers are able to park from outside the vehicle via their mobile devices. BMW also debuted its 9.0 operating system with an updated version of its voice assistant that uses Amazon\u2019s Alexa Large Language Model. And a new video app will allow for live TV and on-demand streaming.\nOther features, available through BMW\u2019s Digital Premium subscription service, include console-style, two-player gaming and a variety of other third-party apps. It\u2019s an interesting litmus test as to whether customers are ready to pay for digital content, as BMW backpedaled on its subscription fee for Apple CarPlay a few years ago.\nSupernal S-A2 eVTOL\nA Hyundai subsidiary based in Northern California\u2019s Silicon Valley, Supernal unveiled the S-A2 eVTOL designed for city operations. The zero-emissions flying machine has a purported range of 25 to 40 miles. Designed by the Genesis studio, based in Irvine, Calif., the S-A2 features reverse-opening butterfly doors, ubiquitous glass, and lime-green ambient lighting.\nHyundai and its subsidiaries have been bullish on expanding their products and services, also showing a gargantuan automated tractor, as well as the now-familiar robot dogs from Hyundai-acquired Boston Dynamics. \u201cWe have evolved from being a car company into a mobility company,\u201d stated Hyundai CEO Jay Chang at the S-A2\u2019s reveal. Judging by the 2024 CES, that\u2019s a transition many presenters can now claim.\nRead More On:\nMore Cars\nJeep Unveils Its First All-Electric Car for the U.S., the 600 HP Wagoneer S\nThese Limited-Edition Prints Meticulously Recreate Aston Martin\u2019s DB5 and Valkyrie\nThis New Ford F-150 Lightning Finally Takes the All-Electric Truck Off-Road\nA Stunning 1980 BMW M1 With Only 13,000 Miles Is Currently Up for Grabs\nElevate Your Inbox\nNewsletters curated for the connoisseur.\nGive the Gift of Luxury\nLatest Galleries in Cars\nMore From Our Brands\nRobb Report\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nLegal\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nSubscribe/Purchase\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nSubscriber Services\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nConnect\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret"

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES wrap: Nvidia, Motorola Mobility get top marks\nThe Consumer Electronics Show is about to wind down---mercifully---and it's time to hand out grades for the major tech players. Motorola Mobility and Nvidia move to the front of the class.\nThis wrap focuses on the strategic positioning of the players at CES this week. Why? Let's face it: Many of the products highlighted this week are either six months away or vaporware. At best, CES is a demoware festival. That's part of the reason why I never go to CES. However, you do get a good feel for strategy from some key tech vendors.\nWith that in mind, here are my top 5 performances at CES from a strategic perspective.\nStifel Nicolaus analyst Doug Reid said:\nMotorola Mobility confirmed steps to diversify carrier relationships beyond Verizon (specifically, with Atrix 4G on AT&T) give us increased confidence that management is effectively addressing the threat of iPhone arriving on Verizon in 1Q11.\nGrade: A. See all on Motorola Mobility.\nGrade: A+\nSamsung: At CES, Samsung is everywhere. The company is talking phones, PCs, TVs and everything in between. The biggest standout for Samsung was its slider PC, which is a workable mix between a tablet and a laptop. Is Samsung's device an iPad killer? No way. However, Samsung may just have found a way to create a netbook done right. On the 4G device front, Samsung was also all over the place boasting powerful Android smartphones.

For a more subtle effect, the Curved In2visible Display integrates seamlessly into the cockpit enabling new design possibilities and turning a vehicle into a living room on wheels.\nAs vehicles integrate more software and take on functions like computers and smartphones, they must also become more secure. Continental has considered this with its Face Authentication Displays. These are the highest security standards for smooth car entry and safe vehicle start. The \u201cliveness check\u201d ensures only the driver, or those registered to the vehicle\u2019s profile, can secure access.\nIncreasing mobile computing power\nIn addition to becoming more automated, vehicle technology is increasingly more connected. Connected vehicles make driving safer and more convenient. To support such new functions, cars have become computers on wheels. Software-defined vehicles and connected mobility require more intelligence and computing power, but current vehicle architectures are reaching their limits. Continental\u2019s Smart Cockpit High-Performance Computer (HPC), in collaboration with Google Cloud, demonstrates how the Smart Cockpit HPC enables the mobility experience of the future. Together, the two companies are equipping cars with generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), making Continental one of the first automotive suppliers to integrate Google Cloud capabilities directly into vehicle computers. With this, drivers can interact with their car in a natural dialogue. Whether drivers need help finding the right tire pressure when the car is fully loaded or want to know more about local places of interest at their destination or along the route when they are on vacation, the generative AI can compile the required information and answer the drivers\u2019 questions.\nDeveloping the future of driverless transportation\nThe Radar Vision Parking solution, named a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree, enables Level 3 and Level 4 driving and parking functions of software-defined vehicles. By combining high-resolution surround radars with high-resolution cameras, Continental enables parking use cases that require very precise and close-range measurement around the vehicle. Early parking slot detection, for example, lets users park in a single stroke without driving past the spot.\nVisitors will also experience the power of partnerships with Aurora Innovation's autonomous technology. In this first-of-its-kind partnership, Continental is responsible for industrializing the autonomous driving system kits which will leverage a wide spectrum of Continental\u2019s extensive automotive product portfolio from sensors, automated driving control units (ADCU), high performance computers (HPC), telematics units and more, to the complete fallback system which covers the full chain of effects. Continental will integrate these hardware components into pods which will be supplied to Aurora\u2019s vehicle manufacturing partners. This will advance the product offering for autonomous trucking customers.\nAlso on display will be the Full Stack Automated Driving Solution with Ambarella. Continental contributes the hardware and large parts of the software to this partnership, while Ambarella provides the System-on-Chip (SoC) platform and further software functionalities. Compared to other domain controller SoCs, Ambarella\u2019s \u201cCV3-AD\u201d chip family provides higher performance to process sensor data faster and more comprehensively for greater environmental perception and safer mobility, at up to five times higher power efficiency. As a result of this strategic partnership, the next generation of vehicles, ranging from L2+ to the highest automation levels, will be able to utilize the powerful, energy-efficient, and scalable mobility system solutions from Continental and Ambarella.\nContinental at CES 2024\nContinental will showcase its latest technologies at a private structure exhibit in Central Plaza across from the Las Vegas Convention Center from Tuesday, January 9 through Friday, January 12. The technology company has numerous solutions that highlight mobility innovations, from the road to the cloud. An invitation-only media event has been scheduled for January 9.
