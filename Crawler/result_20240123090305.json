The company will present 20 new mobility technologies that are ready for immediate mass production.\nAt CES, Mobis will focus its efforts on growing its international sales by targeting global clients. Various products in areas such as automotive components, electrification, lamp and Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) will be showcased to potential clients, including its future mobility core technologies, such as the Innovative Display series \u2014 rich in high-value advanced technology \u2014 and the high-power Integrated Charging Control Unit (ICCU).\nThe Innovative Display series, which is a collection of high-value, cutting-edge technologies, will be the focus at the Mobis exhibition. The company will present its leading innovative display technologies for automobiles, such as the world's first in-vehicle rollable display and swivel display, as well as the Quantum Dot and Local Dimming Display (QL) display and 3D display that feature OLED-level performance in LCD.\nA transparent display for automobiles will be presented for the first time during the exhibition. This product is a next-generation display which employs holographic optical elements technology. The display can realize the projection of clear images on a transparent panel while providing drivers with a wider sense of space and openness than that of general displays.\nTransparent displays enable images to be magnified on the front windshield. Thus, drivers can check various display information without shifting their gaze too much, increasing the level of safety. Because of their unique features, it is expected that transparent displays will bring many changes to future automobile designs once they are mass produced. Estimates indicate significant demand from global car manufacturers, creating high expectations for the display's future technological development and mass production.\nInnovative technologies in the field of electrification, the driving force for future growth, also await to be selected by global automakers based on Mobis' abundant mass production know-how. At the center of electric driving is the 22 kW-class ICCU, which Mobis proudly presents along with its battery system (BSA).\nICCU is a key element for electric vehicle charging and driving and is a power conversion system integrating elements such as DC/AC charging devices and communication equipment. The higher the output, the better the charging speed and efficiency. If the 22 kW-class ICCU is installed in an electric vehicle with the same specifications, the vehicle's charging time is reduced by half when compared to that of an 11 kW-class ICCU.\nMoreover, the 22 kW-class ICCU is closely related to vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology, a type of electric car battery used as a large power source, offering limitless versatility. Mobis is planning to lead related markets through its 22 kW-class ICCU, which surpasses the capability of the 11 kW-class and has received the greenlight for mass production.\nAdditionally, Mobis will introduce its future mobility vehicle, which utilizes next-generation mobility technologies, for the first time at CES. In the past, the exhibition has been mainly comprised of visual displays, showcasing technical products and concept cars. However, this year, exhibition visitors will be allowed to get in the actual automobile, offering attendees an interactive and enjoyable experience. The automobile is equipped with features, such as the e-Corner system, that have been capturing the public's attention. This system allows all four wheels to turn 90 degrees, enabling parallel movement.\n* Hyundai Mobis Booth: Las Vegas Convention Center, West Hall #5216\nAbout Hyundai Mobis\nHyundai Mobis is the global no. 6 automotive supplier, headquartered in Seoul, Korea.

        "raw_content": "Astounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nThe world's biggest consumer tech show lets us dream of a Jetsons-style world where these futuristic concepts come to pass.\nLooking to the future\nCES 2024 is a candy-colored box of goodies. While you can certainly buy some of the wares at the show, some of the most intriguing tech concepts trumpeted at CES are visions of the future we wish were already real. (Others were straight-up wacky.) Here's what's sparking our imagination.\nTalking, color-changing BMW\nRemember KITT, the talking car from Knight Rider? It's getting closer to reality thanks to Dee, a talking, color-changing BMW concept car displayed at CES. It will listen and respond to commands from curbside, as well as remotely via a smartphone app. Plus, the concept's exterior skin is covered with new full-color E Ink technology that can instantly shift between up to 32 colors, allowing you to generate patterns and multicolor schemes on the fly to customize your ride.\nSelf-service airport screening pods\nAirport security lines are never fun, and they can be so long they result in travelers missing their flights. Thankfully, the Transportation Security Administration is testing a new self-service system that could let you complete the screening process on your own. The self-service screening pods are for TSA PreCheck passengers to use as individual screening consoles. When a passenger steps inside the screening pod, they show their ID and the machine will begin scanning them and their bags. Each station includes a video monitor with step-by-step instructions. The prototype that's being shown at CES this week is the Micro-X self-screening system.\nJackery solar Mars bot and rooftop camper\nJackery displayed two concept items -- one more practical than the other. The company showed off a \"Mars rover\" with solar panels. The Solar Generator Mars Bot is like a portable power station on wheels with solar panels sliding out of the sides to capture more sunlight, somewhat like NASA's Opportunity Rover, with power outlets. And a more practical item on display was the company's rooftop camper tent. Solar panels mounted inside the hardshell roof of the pop-up tent and extending wings of panels can provide power through one of the company's power stations, running plenty of camping equipment for long journeys.\nKia's Lego-like concept vehicles\nKia debuted three concept vehicles at CES 2024: the PV1, PV5 and PV7, the automaker's new Platform Beyond Vehicle family. They are electric vans that can be customized to move products, serve as work or living spaces, be converted to modular pop-up stores, and operate with or without a driver behind the wheel. Think Legos for vehicles -- they can be reconfigured almost at will.\nHyundai's steering tech\nThe Hyundai Mobion concept vehicle moves unlike any other vehicle you've probably seen. The newly developed eCorner steering technology uses advances in robotics technology to allow the vehicle to move laterally, rotationally, and do all sorts of crazy things. The wheels can be moved independently, but also in multiple different configurations. The car can even crab walk, and it can do rear-wheel steering on a level that we've almost never seen before. Hyundai hopes to begin shopping the tech around in 2025 or so.\nQuantum dot-powered TV of the future\nNanosys has created a prototype 12.3-inch nanoLED screen that could be thinner, brighter and more efficient than OLED. What's nanoLED, you ask? It's a technology based on electroluminescent, aka \"direct-view\" quantum dots, and its screens boast improved picture quality, energy savings and manufacturing efficiency. While the screens can't quite be made in TV size yet, the new prototypes are big enough for tablets, small laptops and automotive uses.\nHyundai's electric air taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the CES debut of the Supernal S-A2. Hyundai's advanced air mobility wing Supernal displayed its new, second-generation S-A2, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, air taxi. It'll take to the air as early as 2028, the company said.\nDoublepoint Android watch software\nA Finnish startup created some impressive software, called Doublepoint, that turns your smartwatch running Android's WatchOS into a kind of remote control you can wear on your wrist.\nIt makes your watch a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection. You may be able to dim your lights, scroll Netflix or do any number of other things.\nHisense projector concept car\nHisense doesn't make cars, but the company is demonstrating its laser TV in-car technology at CES. CNET's\u00a0David Katzmaier calls it\u00a0\"basically a drive-in movie theater built into your car.\" There's a laser projector right on the front bumper -- you could project a movie straight from your car onto a flat surface, like your garage door. Inside the car, you can turn the windshield into an information hub, allowing drivers to simultaneously observe virtual images and the real environment.\nSamsung transparent micro-LED\nTransparent OLED\u00a0and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, but Samsung says its micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the going tech. That means you should be able to see through it more easily to objects on the other side.\nOne intriguing use: One day, you could be in a luxury box at an athletic event or concert looking through this transparent micro-LED glass. Scores, replays and highlights could appear on the \"windows\" and augment the experience of the game without obscuring it. (You're still on your own for getting those luxury box tickets, however.)\nSamsung's flip phone concept\nSamsung's Flex In & Out Flip concept is like a Galaxy Z Flip you can fold in both directions. Unlike the Galaxy Z Flip 5 and other flip phones you can buy today, it folds completely backward so that you use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nLG DukeBox\nIf you've ever wanted to sync up The Wizard of Oz with Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, the LG DukeBox might be just the device for you. It's a 360-degree speaker with a transparent OLED panel at the front to show off the tube amplifier inside. LG says the screen can be used to watch movies or \"create a cozy fireplace ambiance where the vacuum tube is visible amidst the flickering flames.\"\nLG concept car\nLG has a car? It's just a concept for now, but this futuristic beauty features completely autonomous driving, seats that turn completely around, and of course, plenty of screens. It also works with LG's smart home system, and there's a video game system and concierge station that holds a wine bottle. AR displays give you information on businesses you're passing as the car drives you around.\nSamsung rollable OLED\nImagine\u00a0Samsung's flexible rollable OLED display technology\u00a0inside your car. These screens offer small, unobtrusive displays when you're driving, but when you need to charge your electric vehicle, you can fold out the screen to a larger size for movie watching or playing games. It folds right back up to the size of a chunky highlighter when you're done.\nStained glass solar panels\nThink you know what solar panels look like? Think again. This crystal isn't just an art object but a solar panel capable of turning sunlight energy into power. Extra points for not looking like a giant, unsightly black box.\nProject Esther gaming chair cushion\nRazer showed off its new Sensa HD Haptics technology with a concept for a gaming chair cushion. Project Esther, an add-on cushion unveiled at CES, is the first demonstration that Razer has offered of the new technology, which comes via its acquisition of Interhaptics in 2022. It straps on to a chair and creates sensations to let you feel as if you're really experiencing the game you're playing.\nPanasonic's novel solar cells\nPanasonic has a plan to one day turn walls and windows into solar energy. The new solar technology, perovskite, uses different materials than traditional silicon solar panels. The fact that the materials are printed onto walls and windows means Panasonic can manufacture components at much lower temperatures -- which saves energy -- and the solar cells themselves have the potential to one day capture as much energy as traditional solar panels, if not more.\nHonda 0 Series Saloon\nHonda gave CES attendees their first peek at its next generation of battery electric cars, the Honda 0 (pronounced \"zero\") series, expected to launch in the US in 2026. Shown here is the\u00a0sharply styled 0 Series Saloon, the flagship model.\nIt will be joined by the more upright and van-shaped Honda 0 Space-Hub, featuring a transparent canopy and center-facing bench seats.\nMore Galleries\nSteak Toasters, Indoor Smokers and Robot Cocktails: All the Kitchen Tech of CES 2024\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nThe Rabbit R1 AI Assistant Looks Downright Retro in Orange\nOnePlus 12 and 12R Have an Elegant but Familiar Design\nSamsung's Galaxy S24 Ultra Now Has a Titanium Design\n17 Hidden iOS 17 Features and Settings on Your iPhone"

Subscribe\n\u201cOur goal is to help stakeholders understand the future of mobility.\u201d\nHome \u203a News Releases \u203a Hyundai Mobis introduces MOBION and its core electric vehicle technologies at CES 2024\nHyundai Mobis introduces MOBION and its core electric vehicle technologies at CES 2024\nFeaturing an innovative e-Corner System that enables sideways/diagonal motion and pivot turns\nHyundai Mobis a global automotive supplier, unveiled the \u201cMOBION\u201d electric vehicle (EV), equipped with the next-generation \u2018e-Corner System\u2019 motion technology, for the first time at CES 2024. During the exhibition, visitors and customers have the first-hand opportunity to experience MOBION moving in ways they may have never seen a vehicle move before, including lateral and diagonal motion, as well as stationary pivot turns.\n\u201cThe MOBION represents the embodiment of Hyundai Mobis\u2019 core technologies, all of which are ready for immediate mass production,\u201d said Vice President Lee Seung-Hwan, the Head of Advanced Engineering at Hyundai Mobis. \u201cAlways striving to shift the mobility paradigm with vehicles, Mobis created MOBION to showcase our key products and capabilities.\u201d\nTo enable sideways movement, diagonal driving, and pivot turns, MOBION\u2019s four wheels are individually controlled. The e-Corner System, responsible for translating these dynamic movements into reality, comprises four key technologies. At its core is the \u201cIn-Wheel\u201d technology, which literally propels the EV forward.\n\u201cIn-Wheel technology involves placing four small motors inside each wheel, as opposed to the single large driving motor commonly used in EVs,\u201d said Vice President Lee Young-kook, the Head of Electrification Lab. \u201cThis configuration enables each wheel to generate its own power independently.\u201d\nMobis developed the e-Corner System by seamlessly integrating braking, steering, and suspension functions into the In-Wheel. Mobis has successfully secured advanced control technology that harmonizes each of these functions. In a global first, the company conducted successful on-road tests of the system\u2019s driving capabilities in 2023.\nBeyond its e-Corner System, MOBION is capturing attention at CES with its autonomous driving sensor and lamp technologies. As part of MOBION\u2019s design, three light detection and ranging (lidar) devices have been incorporated as autonomous driving sensors. Two short-distance lidars are positioned near the left and right headlamps, complemented by a single long-distance lidar installed at the center of the front of the vehicle. This configuration proves particularly valuable for lateral movement and effectively recognizing nearby objects, especially during maneuvers such as changing lanes diagonally.\nMobis has also introduced a new \u201cExterior Lighting\u201d lamp along with various display functions. Notably, safety and design enhancements have been achieved through the installation of an LED on the front bumper. With the assistance of a short-distance lidar capable of recognizing pedestrians, valuable information is conveyed through the LED. For instance, when the vehicle is at an intersection, the LED displays the direction in which a pedestrian is crossing the street. Additionally, the rear bumper can alert drivers against changing lanes or passing, signaling that a pedestrian is crossing either to the left or right. Mobis is showcasing its new \u201cGround Projection\u201d function at CES as well. This feature complements the e-Corner System\u2019s movement capabilities by providing the vehicle\u2019s direction of travel. For instance, during diagonal or lateral movement, Ground Projection can illuminate the vehicle\u2019s direction on the ground, utilizing lights across a 360-degree spectrum. MOBION can even leverage Ground Projection to generate crosswalk stripes for pedestrians to use when they are detected.\nMOBION is a compound word formed by combing \u201cMobis\u201d and the English word \u201con.\u201d This nomenclature reflects Mobis\u2019 commitment to reimagining and spearheading the electrification of passenger vehicles. By unveiling a fully functional demonstration car at CES, as opposed to a mere conceptual announcement, Mobis aims to convey its confidence in the technologies underpinning MOBION. This approach is intended to make these advanced technologies both accessible and tangible, reinforcing their real-world applicability.\nSOURCE: Hyundai Mobis\nLet us help you understand the future of mobility\nRelated Content\nJanuary 22, 2024\nUSPS unveils E-Transit parcel delivery vans and charging infrastructure plans\nJanuary 22, 2024\nHonda to make organizational changes (effective April 1, 2024) to further accelerate the transformation toward electrification business\nJanuary 22, 2024\nPorsche: The new Macan is coming \u2013 with a sharper design\nContact\nOnline events\nFuture Truck North America 2024\nMarch 12, 2024\nOur Future Truck North America online event brings together more than 1,000 stakeholders to discuss the business models, technologies and trends shaping the future of trucking.\nFuture Truck Europe 2024\nJune 24, 2024\nOur Future Truck North America online event brings together more than 1,000 stakeholders to discuss the business models, technologies and trends shaping the future of trucking.\nWelcome back , to continue browsing the site, please click here"

        "raw_content": "Consumer Technology Association\nCES 2024: Rubber hits the road for the connected car\nThe world\u2019s leading consumer electronics show has changed \u2013 from connected kitchens and cleaners, it is now, say some, the Detroit Auto Show on steroids. We see which roads are about to be taken in this new space for computing\nTo aficionados, CES has always meant days of madness, with visitors to its home at the Las Vegas Convention Centre (LVCC) surrounded by a morass of newfangled consumer electronics. In the past, these have ranged from TVs measuring hundreds of inches and displays covering whole walls, to connected kettles, fridges and other kitchen appliances, to robotic vacuum cleaners and robots of varied forms. The internet of things (IoT) in its truest sense.\nYet at CES 2024, in what probably is the first true post-Covid show, there was a very apparent, and almost literal, new drive to the event. While all of the varied connected appliances and technologies were there in force as ever \u2013 with the leaders in TV and video, such as Sony, Panasonic and Hisense, showing off their latest ranges \u2013 the main attention hit the highway, with connected automotive use cases exemplifying the emergence of software-defined vehicles (SDVs) in what industry leaders are calling the new era of computing.\nThis point was made very strongly in one of the keynote addresses. Fox\u202fBusiness Network\u2019s Liz Claman noted that she had been coming to CES for many a year and that she could remember the first time the industry arrived at the show in the middle of the last decade in the form of former Ford CEO Alan Mulally, the first auto executive of his status to be invited to speak there.\nWhile making the case that in-vehicle connectivity is nothing new, Claman said CES 2024 showed just how far it had come in that time and that CES was now effectively the Detroit Auto Show \u2013 the flagship event for the industry as a whole \u2013 \u201con steroids\u201d.\nCES showed car manufacturers\u2019 rapid increase in the electrification of their product lines, leading to a sharp increase in in-car electronics such as digital cockpits,\u202fadvanced driver assistance systems\u202f(ADAS) and in-vehicle infotainment systems.\nClaman was not alone in her take. Just before the doors opened on CES, analyst IDTechEx released a report forecasting a 35% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in automotive software-related revenue by 2034, putting software-related revenue at more than $700bn annually.\nThe study,\u202fConnected and software-defined vehicles 2024-2034: markets, forecasts, technologies,\u202fnoted that the most basic form of SDV is where the user experience is affected in some way by the software in a vehicle. It said that, generally, a software-defined vehicle requires a constant cellular connection (4G or 5G), a large, touch-enabled screen, and a powerful central compute system that is also connected to the vehicle\u2019s constituent components. Many SDVs also incorporate third-party apps and in-vehicle payments to add more features and convenience to drivers.\nIndeed, a visitor to the LVCC\u2019s recently built West Hall would have been struck by just how many of the leading automotive manufacturers were showing off their range of connected vehicles. BMW was right by the front door, and not far away on the CES parking lot were connected vehicles from the likes of Mercedes, Jeep, John Deere and Hyundai, surrounded by IT and communications leaders whose products were making these vehicles smarter and equipped for the forthcoming days of vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks that will almost certainly be the basis for future driving experiences.\nCars and computers connect\nFox\u2019s Claman was there to set the scene for this brave new connected world, interviewing Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon to show exactly how IT leaders were engaging with automotive as a key market. Amon suggested CES was now \u201ca car show, among other things\u201d, with vehicles being a new space for computing.\nHe added that Qualcomm was undergoing a fundamental shift in how it sees itself, from a wireless communications company to being a connected processor and artificial intelligence (AI) company. The overarching strategy for the company going forward is to tap into the growing world of AI in local devices.\n\u201cWe have been very passionate about the role of AI in the devices we carry. We\u2019ve been talking about on-device [AI for a long time] and our job was [to make] a computing engine that is going to make that technology run pervasively \u2026 The next form of computing, which is accelerated computing for AI, is going to happen everywhere. There\u2019s fundamentally one thing that is different now. I look at [AI on devices] as the foundation of many of the things we\u2019re doing with the Snapdragon digital cockpit and some of the rapid success we have had in automotive.\u201d\nIn aiming to realise Amon\u2019s vision, Qualcomm used CES 2024 to launch a range of automotive products based on its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform\u202fto support next-generation digital cockpits, connected car technologies, connected services, advanced driver assistance and automated driving systems. Within the Snapdragon roadmap, Qualcomm said automakers were being equipped to meet the increasing needs for higher levels of safety and intelligence powered by LTE,\u202f5G, connected services,\u202fV2X, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, satellite communications and precise positioning.\nIn addition to bringing AI forward within the automotive sphere, Qualcomm believes connectivity remains integral to the global industry\u2019s digital transformation, powering what Amon calls an \u201cunprecedented amount of innovation\u201d. A key example is embedding the Salesforce CRM solution within the Snapdragon Cockpit and trialling financial solutions so that digital payments can be made from a car and associated with individual drivers.\nIn an example of where its automotive technology is being deployed, Qualcomm has signed a deal with Robert Bosch to introduce a central vehicle computer capable of running infotainment and\u202fadvanced driver assistance system (ADAS) functionalities\u202fon a single system-on-chip (SoC). Bosch\u2019s new central vehicle computer, known as the\u202fcockpit & ADAS integration platform, is based on the\u202fSnapdragon Ride Flex\u202fSoC. Together, the companies say they have successfully executed several in-vehicle infotainment projects and established a global customer base in this area.\nThe Bosch deal also highlights the fact that one of the key aspects of the connected vehicle marketplace is that is it dependent on a strong ecosystem, with partners from across the traditional automotive supply chain working in conjunction with the IT and comms industry.\nDigital twins for faster development\nMarelli is a mobility technology supplier to the automotive sector, whose stated mission is to transform the future of mobility through working with customers and partners to create a \u201csafer, greener and better-connected world\u201d.\nIts key products include automotive lighting and sensing, electronics systems, electric powertrains, green technology solutions and interior experiences. The latter comprises cockpit module assemblies and modules to manufacturers, from steering members to cockpits and consoles. As SDVs, powertrain evolution, advanced connectivity and autonomy are rapidly reshaping the needs, designs and architectures of next-generation vehicles, Marelli says its approach will be based on co-creating the future of mobility with its customers, suppliers and leading technology partners.\nThe company used CES 2024 to show the IT and comms partnerships it had to offer to automotive manufacturers \u2013 not just the in-car products it could support, but also the connected services that such vehicles could take advantage of to produce digital cockpits and infotainment systems. Its key partners include Qualcomm, Amazon Web Services (AWS) and BlackBerry QNX.\nThe firm stresses that complexity within vehicles is getting higher and higher, and the key to accelerated development of new products and services is the cloud.\nIn a demonstration at CES 2024, the firm showed a number of its connected vehicle options with its partners, in particular showing off the benefits of creating a digital twin of the digital cockpit using a Qualcomm generation four chip, BlackBerry QNX Hypervisor, and a cluster and in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) applications running on top of that with a virtual version running on the cloud. The virtual setup comprised AWS cloud infrastructure, Qualcomm emulated hardware and QNX hypervisor.\nOffering a reason for using a digital twin, Marelli notes that a traditional automotive production development programme is very linear: you start with hardware, then you do software, then integration. Typically, it takes about three years, which Marelli says is just no longer an acceptable development timeline. With a digital twin, manufacturers can decouple hardware development from software developers and start developing in the cloud on virtualised hardware. And when the hardware is ready, manufacturers can take the software, put it on the hardware and continue integration and testing.\nMarelli estimates that this will reduce standard development timelines by up to 70% \u2013 from 36 months to 12-16 months \u2013 and reduce hardware costs by 30% because fewer physical hardware samples would be needed for development and testing. In the CES demo, Marelli created a digital twin for a zonal architecture, testing out the media player and other key functions within the cluster display.\nThe next big area of focus from a development perspective will be with microcontrollers, which still drive a lot of products in vehicles. A virtual product is expected at CES 2025.\nSupporting car connectivity\nThose of a certain age would have been hugely interested to see the return of BlackBerry to the comms market. Even after its meteoric fall after defining mobile business in the immediate post-millennial era, the company never went away. And while renaissance may not yet be the word to describe the company\u2019s overall status in the comms industry, at CES it was most certainly back with interesting solutions.\nAt the show, BlackBerry revealed the general availability of version 8.0 of its QNX Software Development Platform\u00a0(SDP) which is designed to deliver a scalable, high-performance, real-time operating system for the current embedded computing industry, offering particular support for next-generation automotive and IoT systems. It also announced that it is working with AWS on the creation of a virtual cockpit\u00a0platform for manufacturer Stellantis as part of its virtual engineering workbench, enabling the delivery of infotainment technology.\nAnother manufacturer BlackBerry is working with is Jeep, a user of its IVY mobility platform. Tarun Shome, product management director for BlackBerry IVY, revealed at CES 2024 that the company has been in the automotive industry for some time and currently provides secure access technology for over 235 million today.\nExplaining BlackBerry IVY\u2019s function, Shome reemphasised Qualcomm\u2019s Amon\u2019s point about the power of local devices. \u201cIt\u2019s a middleware platform that allows us to take signals from the vehicle and create rich insights from the vehicle edge. So rather than actually processing in the cloud, sending loads of connected vehicle data, we have the ability to use the compute power that we have within the vehicle to then provide insights on signals,\u201d he noted.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed it in conjunction with AWS, so as a partnership, and we then have some elements that allow us to control and configure everything from the code, and then to deploy software artefacts that run within our runtime on the vehicle to create these insights,\u201d Shome added.\nShome sees specific opportunities arising from being able to create meaningful insights from data that is created from within the vehicle. BlackBerry is also looking to offer business efficiencies. Shome believes the BlackBerry technology can help reduce connectivity costs for connected vehicles by 70% of the connectivity costs due to processing in the vehicle, and that around 97% of compute costs can be taken away for some of the use cases.\nIn addition to AWS, BlackBerry is working with a range of ecosystem partners for its system to be implemented by the likes of Jeep. Shome revealed specific examples: \u201cIf you look at the partnerships we have, we have companies that are providing driver monitoring systems, we have companies that are providing tyre wear predictions, running IVI by taking information from the wheels. We have insurance-based use cases to where you typically have a telematics black box that you can replace with a software component. We have a company that\u2019s looking at micro adjustments on your steering wheel and showing you [driver performance]. We have crash analysis by using the forward-facing cameras, and also sensors on the vehicle to detect crashes and create a report. We have facial recognition and offer [fleet managers] driver monitoring. What we want to do is to provide the tools to allow [manufacturers] to build out the use cases.\u201d\nFuture thinking\nWhile CES 2024 highlighted a whole host of technologies that could be implemented into automotive use cases, the one caveat is that the current infotainment innovations may not be hitting the road in commercially available vehicles for some time yet. Maybe not until 2028 or later. By this time, the industry will likely be seeing the first in a range of 6G connectivity services. So how far do technology firms need to be thinking ahead when it comes to connectivity?\nEnrico Salvatori, senior vice-president and president of Qualcomm Europe, noted that his company was very aware of the capabilities of the next generation of mobile, working with other players in the market to set \u201centry procedures\u201d and set their specifications requirements. Yet he stressed there was plenty more that could be done in terms of 5G.\n\u201c[6G] is one effort ongoing, even though in the initial phase. There are still a lot of big R&D efforts in the development of 5G, so there is still a lot of work to be done on 5G for us, in particular in terms of implementing the modem, the chipset, the new performance. [In that], there is a gain. We think edge AI will see a huge effort in R&D driving the future and we are already there, but there will be more to come.\n\u201cBecause this is automotive, you will see more and more SDV needs. You need to have a central compute platform with high performance. And then by software, you define the connected car \u2013 is it an entry-level or mid-range model? And with the software, we can do over-the-air updates. And because of 5G, it will drive the evolution of performance. With AI, everything is done by software, but we need to go to work on hardware to be ready to support the additional software performance requested in the future.\u201d\nAnd as CES 2024 showed, for \u201cadditional\u201d, read \u201chuge\u201d. Past CES events have tended to leave visitors wondering whether what they saw will ever be commercialised. It\u2019s doubtful this will be the case for what anyone saw at CES 2024 in the automotive space.

Behind a fixed cab, or \u2018driver zone\u2019, a variety of interchangeable upper bodies, or \u2018life modules\u2019, can be connected to the base vehicle via a hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling technology, turning the PBV into a taxi during the day, to a delivery van at night, and a personal recreational vehicle on weekends.\nThe weldless body structure assembly is designed to enable the length of moveable members to be flexibly adjusted according to vehicle use purpose. Shipped in standardized, convenient kit form, Dynamic Hybrid technology is intended to allow for the quick and simple in-field transformation of a Kia PV5.\nThe design of Kia\u2019s PBVs is inspired by robust, simple and clever tools and goes beyond mere aesthetics. Kia\u2019s mission is to design PBVs that are simple and intuitive to operate and engage with, regardless of where, when or how they are used.\nWhether the purpose of the vehicle is to transport people, move goods, or meet logistics or personal mobility needs, Kia\u2019s goal is to ensure each PBV shares a consistent quality of design that reflects its solid, robust nature and projects a dependable and highly capable attitude.\nA combination of a simple yet robust surface language combined with expressive graphics seamlessly unifies the four Concept PV5 models, despite their diverse natures. On each vehicle, large doors open out to reveal an exceptionally accommodating pillarless opening that provides easy ingress and egress. Inside, the extended wheelbase and electric platform ensure wide, flat open spaces to offer stowage and usage possibilities.\nInspiration becomes reality\nKia plans to create an ecosystem that fosters interaction between PBVs. With extensive modularity \u2014 including the ability to share features across all vehicles \u2014 Kia hopes its PBVs will enhance versatility, opening up possibilities to cater to the needs of both businesses and individuals.\nIn line with phase one, Kia plans to make various versions of the PV5 available in the future, including Basic, Van, High Roof, and Chassis Cab. In the future, Kia also plans to introduce a Robotaxi model developed with Motional (a joint venture between HMG and Aptiv), which aims to provide a revolutionary autonomous hailing experience for passengers.\nDuring phase two, symbiosis of the PBV ecosystem will be complimented by two further models, the \u2018PV7\u2019 and \u2018PV1\u2019, utilizing cabinet and frame systems to enhance interaction and connectivity among vehicles based on the modular concept.\n\u201cKia PBVs will initiate a new era of seamless everyday business and lifestyle solutions. We hope to make our customers\u2019 lives easier and better, whether they\u2019re stationary or on the move, offering exceptional flexibility and customization through radical modularization,\u201d said Karim Habib, Executive Vice President and Head of Kia Global Design.\nTo take full advantage of the opportunities enabled by PBVs, Kia plans to launch a dedicated business system, encapsulating various aspect of the process, from the product line-up to integration of software solutions, and global partnerships.\nThe product line-up outlined above will be augmented by the introduction of a customer participation-based development process, utilizing customer input and feedback to create more tailored, mission-specific solutions.\nKia is taking significant steps to meet the diverse demands of customers by constructing a PBV-dedicated EVO plant in Autoland Hwaseong, Korea. This factory will implement a hybrid production approach, combining conveyor and cell-based methods. Through collaboration with global conversion partners, Kia will be able to offer conversion models for various PBV line-ups, catering to different customer preferences. The factory is scheduled to become operational in 2025 and is expected to have an annual capacity of 150,000 units.\nThe brand\u2019s solutions for In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI), Fleet Management Systems (FMS), and charging aims to leverage vehicle software-based data and AI technologies to further enable customer-centric solutions, predictive maintenance suggestions to reduce downtime, and charging programs tailored to the customer's business operating environment.\nKia's PBV IVI solution aims to enhance daily life by recognizing user preferences in real-time and providing relevant contextual data. It is expected to offer access to the Kia PBV App Market and third-party apps, allowing customers have information and entertainment content on the go. By connecting with business-specific apps previously limited to mobile devices, it seeks to improve service convenience and information reliability, providing a holistic user experience across different hardware form factors.\nThe fleet management solution for Kia PBVs will be designed to allow customers to efficiently oversee multiple vehicles, providing insights on sales, inventory, and deliveries, benefiting mobility and logistics businesses. Features may include inventory monitoring, temperature control, and intelligent route planning for efficiency. The solution is intended to streamline fleet management with real-time data and AI integration for predictive maintenance and optimal operational efficiency.\nKia's EV charging solution will be designed to optimize charging schedules by considering battery charge levels, routes, schedules, and breaks. Additionally, Kia aims to provide a total energy solution by utilizing advanced charging infrastructure, allowing high-density energy batteries to power mobile devices and emergency equipment. This can eventually be made possible through innovations like Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology.\nThis integration of IVI, FMS, and charging systems is expected to be delivered via unified software, enabling packaged solutions adaptable to various business environments. Kia has established partnerships with companies like Uber, Coupang, CJ Logistics, Kakao Mobility, and Dubai Taxi Corporation to further enhance its PBV-dedicated business system.\n\u201cThe Kia PBV business is the pinnacle of our customer-centric business approach. With the aim of developing PBVs and solutions tailored to their business environments, we are confident that these strong partnerships will be a driving force on the road to becoming a sustainable mobility solutions provider,\u201d said Pierre-Martin Bos, Vice President and Director of PBV.\nFuture business and affiliate partnerships may help strengthen the integration of robotics, AAM, and autonomous driving to support a PBV mobility solution within smart city environments.\nAs such, Hyundai Motor Group's software capabilities transcend beyond vehicles and extend to various areas of mobility, such as robotics, aircraft, and autonomous driving, aiming to enable operation, control, and management, fostering an era of hyper-connectedness between people and things.\nGoing \u2018beyond mobility\u2019\nKia\u2019s PBV models can redefine how customers live their lives. Boundary-pushing design can lead to creating new vehicle interiors and can eventually expand to both mobile and stationary spaces, enhancing daily life, work, and leisure.\nSince the brand\u2019s relaunch in 2021, Kia has embarked on a journey to adapt effectively to the rapidly changing market through its Plan S strategy. With award-winning models including the EV6 and EV9 having helped to successfully establish the company as a leader in the design and manufacture of EVs, Kia aims to solidify its position as a top-tier sustainable mobility solutions provider through the launch of subsequent vehicles, such as the EV3, and EV4. In pursuit of achieving its vision and meeting diverse customer needs, Kia\u2019s brand relaunch has led additionally to a transition towards a sustainable customer-centric management system.\nLeading the way\nKia\u2019s presence at CES 2024 marks a return to the industry-leading Consumer Electronics Show after a five-year absence.\nThe brand will be presenting two exhibitions at the event. Located in the LVCC West Hall, Kia\u2019s PBV exhibition is based on the theme \u2018Place of Inspiration\u2019. The exhibition showcases the diverse ways in which PBVs can inspire and shape individuals' lives through a range of lifestyle and experience displays and features five PBV concept vehicles.\nThe four display areas take the form of visual representations of a park, city, home and factory bathed in four visually distinctive colors. Together, the displays highlight the multiple applications and benefits of Kia\u2019s PBV technology in addition to showcasing Kia's brand values and \u2018Opposites United\u2019 design philosophy.\nKia\u2019s second exhibition is located in the CES Central Plaza, under the theme of \u2018EV Life for Everyone.\u2019 Featuring a futuristic Kia Connected Home\u2122, the display showcases the Kia Concept EV3, Concept EV4 and the EV6 and EV9 production models, in addition to an exciting EV9 driving technology simulation, a 10 innovative items exhibition, and Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) power supply (coming in the future) and Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) camping demonstrations.\nENDS\nKia\u00a0Corporation \u2013 about us\nKia (www.kia.com) is a global mobility brand with a vision to create sustainable mobility solutions for consumers, communities, and societies around the world.
