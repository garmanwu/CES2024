        "raw_content": "Hydrogen Tech Led Heavy-Duty Truck Innovation at CES 2024\nCheck out Electronic Design's coverage of CES 2024.\nGlobal energy consumption has doubled in the past 50 years and continues to grow by around 2% each year. Fossil fuels currently account for some 80% of global energy consumption. In view of climate change, developing a compact, reliable, safe, and cost-effective alternative energy source is a major challenge.\nCountries and industries around the world are investing in hydrogen technologies as one possible pillar of future mobility. The U.S. government, for example, is pushing ahead with the development of H2 infrastructure and investing $7 billion in the construction of hydrogen hubs.\nWhile most automakers are betting on electric vehicles, a few carmakers and especially those who manufacture heavy-duty commercial trucks are more inclined to work on fuel-cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) powered by hydrogen. With Bosch, Hyundai, Bosch, Mercedes-Benz, PACCAR, and others leading the way, this year\u2019s recently completed\u00a0CES was crowded with all types of hydrogen-powered vehicles.\nWhile the energy per mass of hydrogen is substantially greater than most other fuels, its energy by volume is much less than liquid fuels like gasoline. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, for a 300-mile driving range, an FCEV will need about 5 kg of hydrogen. At 700 bar (~10,000 psi), a storage system would have a volume of about 200 liters or 3X to 4X the volume of gasoline tanks typically found in cars today.\nEV batteries are much heavier than fuel cells, and they take hours to fully recharge. Refueling a hydrogen-powered vehicle, on the other hand, is about as time-consuming as filling up a conventional gas tank.\nEvolution of Daimler's GenH2\nDaimler Truck\u00a0recently announced its\u00a0GenH2 electric semi. GenH2\u2019s motors draw power from a fuel cell that runs on liquid hydrogen. Daimler has said the vehicle will appear on German roads by mid-2024 when Amazon, Air Products, INEOS, Holcim, and Wiedmann & Winz will take part in the first customer trials with Daimler fuel-cell trucks (the Mercedes-Benz Group is the largest individual shareholder of Daimler Truck Holding AG). The vehicles will be refueled at designated public liquid-hydrogen filling stations in W\u00f6rth am Rhein and in the Duisburg area.\nKey performance figures of the GenH2 Truck are comparable with conventional long-haul trucks. The fuel-cell system of the GenH2 Truck, according to the company, delivers 300 kW. The truck also has a battery that can add an additional 400 kW in short bursts for quick acceleration and hill climbing. The battery\u2019s 70-kWh storage capacity is sufficient, according to the company, for recycling kinetic energy that\u2019s converted to electric charge via regenerative braking.\nThe Mercedes-Benz GenH2 Trucks that will be used in the first customer trials will offer a payload of approximately 25 tons at a gross combination weight (GCW) of 40 tons. Two special liquid-hydrogen tanks and a specially developed fuel-cell system enable this payload and range.\nThe two stainless-steel liquid-hydrogen tanks of the GenH2 Truck have a high storage capacity of 88 kg (44 kg each), which make them well-suited for covering long distances. The stainless-steel tank system consists of two tubes, one within the other, and they\u2019re connected to each other as well as vacuum insulated.\nA core element of the operating strategy of the fuel-cell and battery system is a cooling and heating system that keeps all components at a suitable operating temperature, thus ensuring maximum durability. In a pre-series version, the two electric motors are designed for a total of 2 \u00d7 230-kW continuous power and 2 \u00d7 330-kW maximum power.\nDirect Hydrogen Combustion\nAt CES, hydrogen fuel-cell manufacturer Bosch announced it will make an engine that can combust hydrogen, avoiding the stage where the energy gets converted to electricity and stored in a battery. When powered by green hydrogen, this engine is practically carbon-neutral. The H2 engine is set to debut this year.\nTanja R\u00fcckert, member of the board of management of Robert Bosch GmbH, noted, \u201cTo help us meet our global energy needs in a resource-efficient way, Bosch is focusing on digitalization, electrification, and hydrogen.\u201d\nBosch is investing extensively in technologies along the hydrogen value chain. The focus is currently on the mobile fuel cell, which recently went into volume production in Stuttgart. Bosch said it has already received its first orders from truck manufacturers in Europe, the U.S., and China.\nPACCAR, a global technology leader in the design, manufacture, and customer support of light-, medium-, and heavy-duty trucks under the Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF nameplates, is leveraging next-generation hydrogen fuel-cell technology developed in partnership with Toyota Motor North America Inc.\nThe companies expanded their partnership to develop and commercialize the technology in Kenworth T680 and Peterbilt Model 579 Class 8 trucks. The powertrain was recently awarded Zero Emission Powertrain certification by the California Air Resources Board. The Kenworth T680 FCEV was on display at CES. And the hydrogen-fuel-cell-powered Peterbilt Model 579 offers zero-emissions heavy-duty operations with up to a 450-mile range, an 82,000-lb. max gross combination weight rating, and refueling times that are consistent with traditional diesel trucks.\nTo date, PACCAR said it has received more than 150 paid deposits for Kenworth and Peterbilt FCEVs, with customer deliveries commencing in 2025.\n\u201cPACCAR is developing the transportation industry\u2019s most important technologies. These include industry-leading battery electric and hydrogen-fuel-cell electric vehicles that help customers operate with the lowest emissions and outstanding efficiency,\u201d said John Rich, PACCAR senior vice president and CEO. \u201cWe are investing in multiple zero-emissions technologies in order to have the right trucks and transportation solutions for our customers.\u201d\nOrganic Waste into Clean Hydrogen\nKorean automaker Hyundai has spent decades working on hydrogen-powered vehicles. At CES, Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, president and global chief operating officer of Hyundai Motor Co., said the tech will play a \u201cprominent role\u201d in the Hyundai Group\u2019s attempt to become a carbon-neutral company by 2050. \u201cIt\u2019s already technologically feasible, and it will eventually make sense economically, too.\u201d\nFor example, Chang-Hwan Kim, who oversees fuel-cell and battery development at Hyundai, noted that Hyundai is working to turn \u201csewage sludge and other forms of organic waste\u201d into clean hydrogen.\nCheck out more of Electronic Design's coverage of CES 2024.\nContinue Reading\nBMW Starts Production of Hydrogen-Powered Pilot Fleet\nTotal Rebuild: BMW Reveals \u201cNew Class\u201d of EVs\nSponsored Recommendations\nVariable-frequency, ZVS, 5-kW, GaN-based, two-phase totem-pole PFC reference design\nGaN-based, 6.6-kW, bidirectional, onboard charger reference design\nHigh-power, high-performance automotive SiC traction inverter reference design\nDesigning a Battery Charging System for Diversifying Applications\nComments\nTo join the conversation, and become an exclusive member of Electronic Design, create an account today!\nNew\nThis Week in PowerBites: A Simple Fix to Extend Li-Ion Lifetime Plus SiC, GaN Advances\nHydrogen Tech Led Heavy-Duty Truck Innovation at CES 2024\nBluetooth\u00ae and Industrial IoT: Applications, Requirements, and How to Leverage the AIROC\u2122 CYW20829\nMost Read\nEdge AI Video Analytics Solution Adopts PICMG Box PC Standard\nMask Mandates, 2FA, and ChatGPT: What to Believe\nProducts of the Week: Long-Range Radar SoC, Planar Signal Transformer for EVs\nSponsored\nThe Infineon Podcast4Engineers\nOn the Road to an Electrified Vehicle Future\nWhat\u2019s next in BMS?

Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company presents a redefinition of its role in creating a more comfortable everyday life, focusing beyond mobility to innovate a human-centered life through the completion of a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a shift toward software-driven approaches.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s exhibition at this year\u2019s CES, in the West Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), is three times larger than its display at CES 2022, spanning an area of around 21,600 sq. ft. It showcases exhibits demonstrating hydrogen and \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV) and artificial intelligence (AI)-related technologies that aim to realize a safe and free future for society.\nThrough this exhibition, Hyundai Motor aims to offer customers an experiential journey into the human-centered future vision through the introduction of key demonstrative technologies in hydrogen and software, alongside future mobility concepts.\nTransition to a hydrogen society: \u2018Hydrogen can be used by anyone, anywhere\u2019\nIn 2021, Hyundai Motor committed to achieving carbon neutrality by 2045 and continues to make efforts to reduce carbon in all areas of the value chain.\nAt the CES 2024, Hyundai Motor announced that it would expand HTWO, its existing fuel cell brand, into the Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand, and announced a \u2018HTWO Grid\u2019 solution that will accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society.\nHTWO harnesses the capabilities of each affiliate within the Group to offer an optimized, customized package that integrates unit solutions (\u2018Grid\u2019) to meet the diverse environmental characteristics and needs of customers at every stage of hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization.\nAt CES, Hyundai Motor is displaying a media table that can examine the technologies that will be applied at each stage of the value chain and showcase the company\u2019s future direction that will speed up the transition to a hydrogen society.\nFirst, in the production stage table, visitors can look at the resource-circulating hydrogen production technology, including two approaches: Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H) and Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H), and a green hydrogen process.\nP2H involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, such as contaminated plastic and vinyl waste, which can be transformed into clean hydrogen energy. It can be achieved by combining liquefaction technology developed by Hyundai Engineering and the gasification technology of the global oil and gas company, Shell.\nW2H is a process that converts biogas from organic waste, such as livestock manure and food waste, into hydrogen. Group entities Hyundai Engineering & Construction (E&C) and Hyundai Rotem are collaborating to enhance the technological development of this process. The W2H Process Diorama displayed next to the HTWO Grid media table demonstrates the process from biogas collection to hydrogen production, carbon capture and hydrogen-refueling station.\nVisitors can also learn about green hydrogen that is produced by electrolyzing water. Electrolysis plants operate on renewable energy sources, such as wind, solar and hydropower. As green hydrogen is produced by a carbon-free energy source, it neither emits polluting gases during combustion nor production, gaining attention as the ultimate clean energy source of the future.\nHyundai E&C and Hyundai Engineering are participating in the construction of electrolysis-based green hydrogen production facilities in Buan and Boryeong, South Korea, respectively.\nRegarding hydrogen storage and transportation, booth visitors can learn about a hydrogen logistics business process established by Hyundai Glovis and the ammonia carrier, one of the methods of transporting hydrogen.\nA stable hydrogen supply is essential for providing hydrogen energy to everyone equally. Hyundai Glovis is preparing for a future hydrogen society by using its hydrogen logistics and distribution capabilities. Specifically, Hyundai Glovis is actively preparing for hydrogen society by strengthening its capabilities in hydrogen transportation.\nThe flow of hydrogen transportation and distribution can be divided into four stages: production, shipping, transportation and consumption. After production, hydrogen undergoes processing for distribution, is injected into tube trailers after high-temperature compression and is then shipped to various locations worldwide. Given the challenges of storing gaseous hydrogen for extended periods, managing an appropriate supply schedule that is tailored to production quantities is crucial. After being transported via hydrogen transport trucks, the stored hydrogen is finally sold and utilized at hydrogen fueling stations, industrial facilities and elsewhere.\nRegarding onshore transportation, hydrogen can be transported by sea in two ways: transported as liquid hydrogen or stored and transported in the form of ammonia. Ammonia carriers are gaining attention as an effective means of transporting hydrogen. Although liquid hydrogen transport allows for mass transport, maintaining a temperature as low as -253 degrees Celsius incurs significant costs. Ammonia transport, on the other hand, has gained popularity as an alternative to liquid hydrogen transport.\nHyundai Glovis has successfully procured orders for two very large gas carriers (VLGCs) for ammonia transport and is set to begin operation in 2024. Hyundai Glovis is dedicated to advancing its maritime transportation capabilities in the realm of hydrogen energy by operating ammonia transport carriers, thereby broadening its business portfolio.\nNotably, the company handles hydrogen transportation from the Dangjin hydrogen shipping center in South Korea to hydrogen fueling stations, coordinating the fueling schedule and dispatch plans for tube trailers and establishing a systematic hydrogen logistics business.\nRegarding hydrogen utilization, booth visitors can explore various hydrogen mobility solutions provided by the Group that can be tailored to customers\u2019 desired purpose and scale.\nHyundai Motor\u2019s XCIENT Fuel Cell is the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell Class 8 heavy-duty truck. It has been recognized for its eco-friendliness and excellent technological prowess in major global markets, such as Switzerland and Germany. Furthermore, the company has successfully launched tractor models specifically designed for the North American market.\nHyundai Motor continues to strengthen its collaborations with partners, including global e-commerce players in the fields of green logistics transformation. The company is committed to providing optimized hydrogen mobility solutions, building on the foundation of its hydrogen fuel cell trucks.\nAlso on display, the mobile fuel cell generator supplies electricity solely through the fuel cell stack without the need for additional auxiliary power storage devices. It can be used in various fields and can provide power in emergencies, such as power outages, or challenging environments where accessing another power supply is difficult.\nThe mobile fuel cell generator is actively used in Electric Touring Car Racing (ETCR) competitions. To ensure the seamless operation of high-performance electric vehicles for all participating companies in the competition, Hyundai Motor has established a charging infrastructure using its hydrogen fuel cell system. The racing cars in the ETCR series recharge their batteries using electricity generated by the fuel cell generator produced by the Group.\nNext to the media table, a sectional model displays the operating principle of a portable hydrogen fuel cell generator, allowing a detailed examination of its structure for easy understanding.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell tram provides environmentally friendly public transportation, contributing to the purification and production of clean air. The hydrogen fuel cell tram is equipped with four hydrogen fuel cells with a capacity of 95 kW and can travel up to 150 km. It purifies approximately 800 \u03bcg of fine dust and produces 107.6 kg of clean air per hour of operation.\nThe hydrogen fuel cell tram is wireless, which does not require tram overhead lines, improving the aesthetics of the city and reducing infrastructure costs. Hyundai Rotem will continuously expand its lineup, including hydrogen high-speed trains, electric multiple units and locomotives.\nBooth visitors can also learn about how Hyundai Steel is preparing to establish a green steel production system to cut carbon emissions in the steel production process.

        "raw_content": "Cookie Disclaimer\nBasket Overview\nHyundai Motor Reveals Vision for Hydrogen Energy and Software Solutions Beyond Mobility at CES 2024\nLAS VEGAS, January 8, 2024 \u2013 Hyundai Motor Company today presented its vision for a hydrogen-powered, software-driven transformation beyond mobility applications at CES 2024. Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company held its Media Day at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas to highlight its future blueprint for a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a vision for software and artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn line with Hyundai Motor\u2019s brand vision, \u2018Progress for Humanity,\u2019 the \u2018Ease every way\u2019 theme reflects the company\u2019s aim to create a comfortable and peaceful living environment by providing three core universal values of freedom, safety, and fairness for the global community. It goes beyond the mere physical utility value of technology and caters to the complex daily lives of people, providing freedom from various limitations, safety in communities from software security and reduced greenhouse gas emissions through hydrogen, and fair accessibility to clean energy and related services.\n\"At Hyundai, we believe that science and humanity are two sides of the same coin; that advanced technology should also make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d said Jay Chang, President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company. \u201cClean hydrogen should be for everyone, powering everything, and available everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cWe measure progress with the real and positive impact it has on humanity,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, President and Global COO of Hyundai Motor Company. \u201cOur theme for CES 2024, \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 is a monumental challenge. But the challenging spirit embedded in the DNA of our 56-year history will continue through the hydrogen and software transformations we\u2019ve unveiled today.\u201d\nAn innovative solution for hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization\nHyundai Motor Group (the Group) has already announced a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, substantiated by a clear RE100 roadmap to use 100 percent renewable energy in its overseas factories by 2045 and in every Group entity by 2050. Hydrogen energy will play a prominent role in achieving those objectives.\nFor nearly half of the company\u2019s existence, Hyundai has been at the forefront of the hydrogen momentum, achieving many firsts, including the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). It now has the world\u2019s highest market share in hydrogen-powered vehicle sales.\nHydrogen plays a crucial role in Hyundai\u2019s sustainability roadmap as it is a clean energy source, with water being its only byproduct when used as fuel. It also enables the maximization of renewable energy utilization worldwide due to its advantages in storage and distribution. Hyundai sees hydrogen as the path to a sustainable future, as it is both clean and accessible.\nHyundai\u2019s hydrogen solutions go beyond passenger cars, trucks and buses to include trams, special equipment, vessels, power generators and advanced air mobility. The company is driving the energy transition as a major hydrogen off-taker.\nHyundai isn\u2019t alone in its commitment to hydrogen energy. In June 2023, the U.S. published its National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap for accelerating the production, processing, delivery, storage and use of clean hydrogen. In December at COP28, the International Hydrogen Trade Forum and the Hydrogen Council launched a suite of flagship initiatives to accelerate the commercialization of hydrogen to transition away from fossil fuels.\nTo further emphasize its commitment to hydrogen, Hyundai highlighted the expansion of HTWO \u00a0from a fuel cell system brand into Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand. HTWO now encompasses the Group\u2019s businesses and affiliates, enabling each stage of the entire clean hydrogen value chain, from production and storage to transportation and utilization. HTWO represents \u2018Hydrogen\u2019 and \u2018Humanity,\u2019 the two main pillars of Hyundai\u2019s fuel cell business.\n\u201cThe HTWO business leverages the Group\u2019s wide-ranging capabilities in various sectors, such as automobile, parts, steel, construction, air mobility, marine, robotics and future technologies,\u201d\u00a0said Ken Ram\u00edrez, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Commercial Vehicle & Hydrogen Business.\u00a0\u201cThe model focuses on the four core areas of the energy value chain: production, storage, transportation, and utilization. The Group\u2019s affiliates are positioned throughout the value chain, forming a hydrogen grid that allows for the development of tailored end-to-end hydrogen solutions.\u201d\nTraditionally, automakers have focused on vehicle utilization, while other industries have covered energy production, storage and transportation. This approach has led to a slow and challenging energy transition process. Hyundai aims to overcome these limitations by combining and integrating its Group-wide hydrogen competencies to revolutionize the energy transition and accelerate the establishment of a hydrogen society.\nHyundai\u2019s new identity as a sustainability player builds upon its core identity as an automobile company. One of the company\u2019s aims is to contribute to the establishment of a hydrogen society by encouraging hydrogen off-takes. Through the HTWO brand, Hyundai Motor Group projects that it will off-take 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, powering businesses, such as clean logistics, green steel production and power generation.\nDuring the presentation, Chang Hwan Kim, Senior Vice President and Head of Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Battery Development, explained that Hyundai is also developing megawatt-scale polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer manufacturing capabilities for green hydrogen production, which is expected to commercialize within the next few years. Hyundai, through sharing components of fuel cell systems, plans to achieve a competitive price compared to existing PEM technologies. While the current market price of PEM electrolyzers is about 1.5 times higher than that of alkaline electrolyzers, the company is confident the price will drop below the alkaline electrolyzers through component sharing.\nFurthermore, the Group is concentrating on resource circulation hydrogen production technology that aims to transform environmental pollutants into clean hydrogen. The resource circulation technology that Hyundai focuses on includes two approaches: Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H) and Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H). W2H involves the fermentation of organic waste, such as food, sludge and livestock manure, to generate biogas. This biogas is then treated to capture carbon dioxide and produce hydrogen. P2H, on the other hand, involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, gasifying the molten plastics and producing hydrogen by removing unnecessary elements.\nHyundai is actively involved in various hydrogen projects globally, starting with Indonesia. The country has shown a growing interest in hydrogen as a crucial pathway to achieving carbon neutrality. There is a need to initiate hydrogen adoption at the local level to foster regional acceptance of this new energy source and drive the establishment of a hydrogen ecosystem throughout Indonesia.\nIn Indonesia, Hyundai is beginning with Waste-to-Hydrogen, through the utilization of waste from local communities, enabling the city to establish its own hydrogen production mini-hubs, eliminating the need to depend on hydrogen transportation and storage. With various off-takers entering the scene, the region will witness the formation of a hydrogen industrial cluster around the hub, thereby promoting the growth of a hydrogen society.\nCurrently, under the partnership with Indonesia, Hyundai is actively seeking the right location in West Java to deploy the HTWO grid solution. This will not only benefit Indonesia but also stands to benefit ASEAN markets in the long run, where hydrogen could play a significant role in driving both the carbon neutrality movement and economic development.\nHyundai is also actively involved in hydrogen-related demonstration projects in the U.S. where it plans to apply the HTWO Grid solution centered on utilization. This includes participation in the NorCAL ZERO project in Northern California, which involves 30 Hyundai XCIENT Fuel Cell trucks to support the decarbonization of the Port of Oakland. The Group will also play part of the \u2018Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs\u2019 program, part of a $7 billion U.S. government initiative for hydrogen infrastructure development.\nHyundai is actively developing hydrogen solutions tailored to specific customer needs. In Georgia, it is working on the Clean Logistics Project, which revolves around the development of a hydrogen mobility value chain at Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA). This dedicated electric vehicle (EV) factory under construction in Georgia expects to produce up to 300,000 EVs annually. Through the Clean Logistics Project, the Metaplant will integrate a comprehensive hydrogen value chain, commencing with the deployment of XCIENT Fuel Cell tractors to manage the logistics of the plant. Hyundai is initiating this project through utilization, backed by its Group counterparts, with the aim of establishing the foundations of a hydrogen infrastructure.\nHyundai\u2019s collaboration with various industries and sectors in Georgia is poised to generate a significant impact, attracting a diverse range of stakeholders to participate in the hydrogen value chain. This collaboration is anticipated to stimulate economic growth and create job opportunities within the state.\n\u201cHyundai's proven history with hydrogen gives Georgians a clearer picture and better understanding of this remarkable opportunity before us, as we further Georgia\u2019s position on the cutting edge of this emerging industry,\u201d said Pat Wilson, Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development. \u201cThese advancements will fuel economic growth and job opportunities in our state, and we look forward to collaborating and focusing on expanding clean technology across a variety of industries and sectors. Having seen the real-world applications already being delivered by Hyundai, we\u2019re excited that Georgia is part of Hyundai\u2019s future.\u201d\nSDx: Building a user-centered mobility ecosystem by defining vehicles, fleets and \u00a0transportation systems with software and AI\nHyundai is undergoing a software-driven transformation led by the entire Group. As a provider of smart mobility solutions, Hyundai recognizes the importance of software and AI in creating a user-centric mobility ecosystem. At CES, the company announced its \u2018Software-defined Everything\u2019 (SDx) strategy, which aims to transform all moving devices, fleets and ecosystems into valuable assets through advanced software and AI.\nThrough its SDx strategy, the Group seeks to develop a mobility ecosystem that meets the needs of users anytime and anywhere. To achieve this, the Group is transitioning everything into a software-defined approach, from vehicle development to building the entire mobility ecosystem. It believes software and AI are enablers of achieving this vision through providing holistic user experience without limitations and is dedicated to delivering mobility services and solutions that prioritize convenience and safety.\nThe Group\u2019s strategy begins with developing \u2018software-defined vehicle\u2019 (SDV). This means to incorporate software development methods to automotive development which means to decouple hardware and software to enable independent updates and advancement of each. The network and controllers are designed within the SDV framework, enhancing development agility and efficiency. This increases the flexibility and scalability of the vehicle development system, enabling faster updates of user-centric features and continuous improvement of device.\nTo enhance the user experience, the Group plans to develop a new infotainment system that supports a vehicle app market. They will also provide software development kits (SDKs) for developers to create killer apps. Additionally, the Group aims to integrate its own large language model (LLM) into their AI assistant and navigation system. This integration will enable more natural and convenient user interaction and experience with enhanced user safety.\nAs SDVs become more common and standardized, management of large-scale fleets will become easier and more efficient. Beyond individual vehicles, the Group is expanding its software solutions to include software-defined fleets for businesses. These solutions offer customized fleet management services, real-time data analytics and user-friendly administrative interfaces, allowing B2B customers to operate vehicles more efficiently and address real-time issues. The Group will offer vehicle data, advanced fleet management services, data analytics and valuable insights to B2B customers of different hardware and software requirements, all without the need for separate telematics devices.\nAs vehicles, fleets and mobility in general gets defined and developed by software, they will then get AI-defined. The Group envisions vehicles evolving into \u2018AI machines\u2019 that continuously learn to better serve customers and transforming vehicles into AI machines that continuously learn to better serve customers and deploy optimized machine learning operations (MLOps). Transforming vehicles into AI machines will enable the Group to automate maintaining and updates of vehicle, simplify or eliminate tedious tasks, provide transparent data, prevent and promptly address potential issues, personalize user experiences and accelerate the enhancement of services and solutions to deliver added value for users. This will contribute to stable and efficient operation of not only devices, but also mobility, logistics, and overall urban operating system.\nThe ultimate goal is to create a concept called \u2018Cloud Transportation\u2019 where software, AI-defined devices and mobility come together to create a mobility ecosystem where transportation is easily accessible to everyone. This concept, referred to as \u2018transportation-as-a-service,\u2019 allows users to freely access transportation and mobility services as needed. Everyone, along with devices and city infrastructure, will be interconnected within an ecosystem, enabling on-demand access to transportation and automatically increasing the intelligence of mobility solutions over time. The Group is currently operating various advanced mobility services, such as demand-responsive transport and self-driving taxis, and collecting data to further advance SDV technology, including autonomous driving, to establish a foundation for Cloud Transportation.\n\u201cAs a mobility solution provider, our vision goes beyond vehicles\u201d, said Chang Song, President and Head of Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s SDV Division. \u201cIt's about empowering a mobility ecosystem. We see movement as a new source of knowledge and innovation. And our solutions and devices make that knowledge universally useful.\u201d\nThe Group presented its recent partnership with Tenstorrent, a company specializing in designing neural processing units (NPUs), further enhancing the Group\u2019s commitment to software and AI advancements.\n\u201cTenstorrent is building a silicon future that you can own. Our hardware and open source software will let you build the products you want,\u201d said Jim Keller of Tenstorrent. \u201cHyundai is building cars, factories, robots, autonomy, infotainment and smart systems. Tenstorrent is aligned with every part of that vision. We\u2019re excited to join Hyundai in gaining the independence to win the high-stakes technology race.\u201d\nIn his closing remarks, President Song highlighted the Group\u2019s ongoing dedication to user convenience and safety, which have been core values since its inception. The Group\u2019s software-development philosophy of \u2018Service-defined, safety-designed\u2019 reflects its mission to provide hassle-free mobility experiences with reliable and secure devices. By leveraging software and AI, the Group aims to develop services and solutions that meet users\u2019 needs responsively, while also taking responsibility for ensuring safety throughout all aspects of mobility, including device stability, data protection and cybersecurity.\nHydrogen value chain and software technologies on display at CES 2024\nHyundai is showcasing its waste-to-hydrogen production and hydrogen value chain as well as SDV technologies and future mobility concepts at CES 2024.

        "raw_content": "Bosch Showcases Electrification, Hydrogen, and Sustainability Innovations at CES 2024\nBosch Showcases Electrification, Hydrogen, and Sustainability Innovations at CES 2024\n(IN BRIEF) Bosch is at CES 2024, presenting its commitment to driving electrification and sustainable energy use, with a focus on hydrogen as a key solution. The company highlights innovations such as automated valet charging for electric vehicles, the use of silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors to enhance EV efficiency, and efficient heat pumps for homes. Bosch is also actively investing in hydrogen technologies, including mobile fuel cells and hydrogen engines, aiming to contribute to a resource-efficient and carbon-neutral future. Additionally, Bosch emphasizes its dedication to software and digitalization to enhance convenience and energy efficiency across various industries.\n(PRESS RELEASE) STUTTGART, 9-Jan-2024 \u2014 /EuropaWire/ \u2014 Whether on the road or in the home, Bosch is driving forward the electrification of its technologies and solutions for sustainable energy use, and sees hydrogen as a key to meeting the world\u2019s energy needs in a climate-neutral way. At the CES 2024 in Las Vegas, Nevada, the company is presenting technology and applications that can not only make life easier, safer, and more convenient, but also more sustainable \u2013 all for the good of our planet. Global energy consumption has doubled in the past 50 years \u2013 and continues to grow by around 2 percent each year . Fossil fuels currently account for some 80 percent of global energy consumption. In view of climate change, this is a major challenge.\n\u201cTo help us meet our future global energy needs in a more resource-efficient way, we at Bosch are rethinking energy use and focusing on a two-pronged approach: electrification and hydrogen.\u201d said Tanja R\u00fcckert, member of the board of management of Robert Bosch GmbH, at CES 2024 in Las Vegas.\n\u201cFor a low-emissions future, we are optimizing the use of traditional energy sources by driving forward electrification in mobility, commercial buildings, and homes. And we are tapping into new, sustainable energy sources \u2013 with hydrogen playing a central role.\u201d\nMore efficient electrification thanks to innovative Bosch technologies\nElectrification is already well advanced, particularly in the mobility sector. Bosch is a leading supplier along the entire electromobility value chain \u2013 from chips, e-axles, and electric motors to battery technology, charging stations, and numerous services. One innovation the company is presenting at CES has been named a CES\u00ae 2024 Innovation Award honoree by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA): automated valet charging. In a parking garage equipped with an automated valet parking system (automated valet parking), electric cars featuring this new technology can drive themselves to an available parking space furnished with a charging spot. At the touch of a button on a smartphone, a robot charges the battery without any further human intervention. Once charging is complete, the vehicle maneuvers driverlessly to another parking space, leaving the spot free for the next car. \u201cThe unique combination of automated valet charging and automated valet parking makes Bosch a pioneer on the market,\u201d R\u00fcckert said, adding: \u201cEvery step toward greater convenience in electromobility increases not only its attractiveness but also its acceptance.\u201d\nThis is another reason why Bosch is focusing on the innovative semiconductor material silicon carbide (SiC), a key component for electrified mobility. The ramp-up of electromobility worldwide is leading to enormous demand for these special semiconductors. Using highly complex processes it developed itself, Bosch has been producing SiC chips at its wafer fab in Reutlingen, Germany, since 2021, and is currently investing more than 1.5 billion dollars in a further wafer fab in Roseville, California. This move will strengthen the company\u2019s international semiconductor manufacturing network. The aim is to start production of the first SiC chips in the U.S. by 2026, and in doing so increase the company\u2019s output tenfold in the years ahead. In electric cars, SiC chips extend driving range and make charging more efficient, as their energy losses are up to 50 percent lower. They also enable the car to travel further on a single battery charge \u2013 on average, range is up to 6 percent greater than with silicon-based chips.\nHeat pumps optimize energy consumption in homes\nAnother Bosch highlight at CES 2024 is the IDS Ultra Heat Pump, which was developed specifically for North America. Unlike conventional models, this heat pump provides 100 percent heating capacity down to outdoor temperatures of degrees Fahrenheit (minus 15 degrees Celsius), and it\u2019s operational down to as low as minus 13 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 25 degrees Celsius). This is a particularly attractive option for people in colder climates in the U.S. or Canada looking to switch from fossil fuel-based heating systems to electrified alternatives. Such a switch can not only save energy but also costs. Bosch has also succeeded in applying heat-pump technology to a different area: in Las Vegas, the company is presenting its most efficient water heater to date, which is a hybrid of an electric storage water heater and a heat pump that is three to four times more efficient than traditional water heaters in the market. \u201cWith solutions like this, we are paving the way to an electrified home \u2013 and helping save costs and energy,\u201d says Mike Mansuetti, president of Bosch in North America.\nVarious new features in Bosch home appliances such as ovens, dryers, and washing machines are also playing their part in this transition. For some time now, it has been common for users to set the start time for their appliance using a timer function. Bosch is now going one step further and equipping its latest generation of dishwashers with its \u201cMySchedule\u201d function for the first time. This can automatically schedule the start of the wash cycle to coincide with the periods when either the electricity price is lowest or green electricity is available. Good news for professional power tool users, too: at CES 2024, Bosch has announced further new partners for its AMPShare power tool battery platform \u2013 more than 30 global partners are now on board. Bosch AMPShare is a cross-brand battery system that allows trade and industry professionals to switch flexibly between different brands of professional tools without having to exchange the battery.\nBosch is actively promoting hydrogen as a pillar of future mobility\nIn addition to electrification, Bosch sees hydrogen as a key to meeting global energy demand in a resource-efficient way. As a storage medium, moreover, hydrogen can facilitate the efficient use of energy generated from renewable sources. Bosch is investing extensively in technologies along the hydrogen value chain. The focus is currently on the mobile fuel cell, which recently went into volume production in Stuttgart. This lies at the heart of the powertrain system for heavy vehicles. Bosch has already received its first orders from truck manufacturers in Europe, the U.S., and China. The company is also working on components for a hydrogen engine, which converts fuel directly into energy without first converting it into electricity. When powered by green hydrogen, this engine is practically carbon neutral. The H2 engine is due to debut this year.\nCountries and industries around the world are investing in hydrogen technologies. The U.S. government, for example, is pushing ahead with the development of H2\u00a0infrastructure and investing 7 billion dollars in the construction of hydrogen hubs. \u201cThe H2\u00a0hubs are an important building block for establishing a hydrogen infrastructure. We at Bosch support these measures and are exploring participation in several of these hubs. Our goal is to help drive forward the clean-energy economy in North America. This is an area where we can contribute our expertise in the production and provisioning of hydrogen,\u201d Mansuetti says.\nSoftware paves the way for greater convenience and energy efficiency\nAcross all its divisions, Bosch is focusing on the use of software and digitalization. The company now has more than 44,000 associates working in software development, and it sees itself as leading the way to software-defined mobility. In Las Vegas, Bosch is presenting new products and solutions together with its strategic partner Amazon Web Services. These include a connected, fully automatic espresso machine, which will also be possible to control from the car using voice assistance such as Alexa, and a point-of-interest assistant, which uses an interior camera in the vehicle to recognize which restaurant or caf\u00e9 the driver is looking at based on their eye movements. The voice assistance then informs the driver in real time and completely automatically whether the restaurant is open and has a free table available.\nBosch is also presenting two new mobility services at the electronics trade fair: Usage Certificate To Go and Vehicle Health Service. The first is an addition to Bosch\u2019s already established Battery in the Cloud services. The feature analyzes battery data, determines the battery\u2019s condition, and helps extend its service life by up to 20 percent through optimization. The second service, aimed at fleet operators, offers features designed above all to prevent vehicle breakdowns. Both innovations aim to extend the service life of vehicles and conserve resources. Bosch is taking a similar approach in the building sector: The company offers digital services to achieve efficiency gains, such as the \u201cNexospace Energy Manager\u201d for the European market. This helps customers to analyze their energy supply and usage and develop specific measures to optimize and reduce consumption. This was the case with the international supermarket chain REWE, for example, which was able to reduce consumption by up to 20 percent in more than 2,000 stores with the help of the \u201cNexospace Energy Manager\u201d. Meanwhile, in manufacturing, Bosch services can help save considerable amounts of CO2\u00a0by increasing efficiency. Decarbonize Industries, an AI-supported software-based service developed by Bosch together with a partner, helps manufacturing companies reduce their carbon footprint and also achieve significant cost savings.\nSource\n1\u00a0Our World in Data, \u201cEnergy Production and Consumption\u201d by Hannah Ritchie, Pablo Rosado, Max Roser\nPresskit #BoschCES 2024\nEvent #BoschCES 2024\nBosch at CES 2024:\nMedia Contact:\nBosch at CES:\u00a0Irina Ananyeva, +49 152 597-53284, Tim Wieland, +1 248 410-0288, Trix B\u00f6hne +49 173 523-9774\nConnected mobility, software:\u00a0Athanassios Kaliudis, +49 152 086-51292\nSmart living:\u00a0D\u00f6rthe Warnk, +49 172 153-8714\nHydrogen:\u00a0Anna Schmatz, +49 173 409-7533\nAutomated mobility:\u00a0Jennifer Gass, +49 152 346-63461\nSustainability:\u00a0Inga Ehret, +49 172 324-2636\nX: @BoschPress\nSOURCE: Robert Bosch GmbH\nMORE ON BOSCH, ETC.:\nComments are closed.\nDIGI COMMUNICATIONS N.V. 2024 FINANCIAL CALENDAR\nCDP INDUSTRY UPDATE JAN 2024\nECARSTRADE ANNONCE DIRK VAN ROOST AU POSTE DE DIRECTEUR ADMINISTRATIF ET FINANCIER\nNEXT-GEN DEALCOHOLIZATION TECHNOLOGY\nPHARMA & BIOTECH: The largest repository of EU/European pharma & biotech press releases spanning 12 years (2012-2024)\nKUKA LAUNCHES VERSATILE KR FORTEC INDUSTRIAL ROBOT WITH EXTENDED ARM\nVIRTUAL ASSISTANT WITH GENERATIVE AI FOR HYPER-PERSONALIZED IN-CAR EXPERIENCE\nSEARCH 30,000+ EUROPEAN PRESS RELEASES\nLoad more...\nAbout EuropaWire\nEuropaWire (EW) is the first truly pan-European and leading press release distribution and newswire service\u00a0for Europe and the European Union working towards consolidating Europe\u2019s voice on the global newswire and media scene.

This means that there will be greater equality in the access to, and use of, energy. Just imagine a world where everyday waste is made into clean energy making our living spaces safe, clean, and free from pollution.\nWe are working on software that is optimized for users and guarantees free movement by connecting mobility options and the city in one place. Based on the data that is accumulated, our software can then proactively protect everyone even in dangerous situations.\nHyundai is making this world a reality with our hydrogen energy and software solutions.\nOur passion for hydrogen energy\nHydrogen energy is not a new thing for us. We have always held the belief that hydrogen energy is essential for the future. In fact, here at Hyundai, we have been developing hydrogen vehicles since 1998. That\u2019s 26 years of expertise already.\nIn 2013, we commercialized the world's first mass-produced Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV), the Tucson iX35 FCEV. We followed this with the launch of the NEXO in 2018 and achieved the top spot worldwide for sales of hydrogen vehicles.\nWith the launch of our hydrogen-powered heavy-duty truck XCIENT Fuel Cell in 2020, we have further verified the excellent quality of our hydrogen mobility. Since 2020, our XCIENT Fuel Cell heavy-duty trucks in Switzerland has accumulated 8.7 million kilometers of cumulative driving in real-life customer operation.\nOur preparation for the future, which began with the development of hydrogen vehicles, has now expanded across our entire company. Our next goal is to provide comprehensive hydrogen-related solutions across the entire hydrogen value chain.\nWhat\u2019s more, to accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society, we need to start using hydrogen on a larger scale. To this end, we will increase our hydrogen consumption to 3 million tonnes per year by 2035 and use this to propel a major transformation.\nThe HTWO Grid, end-to-end hydrogen solution\nTransitioning from fossil fuels to a hydrogen energy ecosystem requires a comprehensive solution that is tailored to the different needs of everyone who needs to use it.\nOur answer is HTWO Grid, an end-to-end hydrogen solution where the capabilities of every affiliate intersect at all stages of hydrogen production from storage and transportation to utilization. This will even offer customized solutions optimized for various environments and physical characteristics through its organic combinations and connections between each technology.\nWe already have different hydrogen solution packages in the United States and are under discussion with Indonesia on a waste-to-hydrogen production focused solution package. Especially, the Clean Logistics Project that will officially launch in the second half of 2024 is expected to drive a hydrogen society in Georgia. We plan to provide our solution to different regions, thus accelerate the transition to a hydrogen society in the future.\nTurning everyday waste into energy\nThe best-known method of producing clean hydrogen is water electrolysis, which produces hydrogen by splitting water. However, the availability of water is different from region to region. So, we became interested in ways to turn waste generated in everyday life into hydrogen.\nWaste-to-energy technology, which we introduced at CES 2024, is a technology that converts sewage, food waste, livestock manure, and plastic waste that is concerned as a headache to all countries.\nWaste-to-energy technology is largely divided into two types. Firstly, waste-to-hydrogen technology is a method that decomposes organic waste with microorganisms to generate biogas and convert this into hydrogen. Secondly, plastic-to-hydrogen technology is a method of obtaining hydrogen by gasifying the molten plastics and producing hydrogen by removing unnecessary elements. Hyundai Motor Group is already in action to produce hydrogen from biogas in Chungju city in Korea.\nBoth technologies have a double positive effect (win-win) as they fix two problems: they can obtain clean hydrogen energy while reducing the waste around us.\nProviding freedom to move through software and AI\nBeyond vehicles, we are also expanding into SDx which means \u201csoftware-defined everything\u201d. This means redefining vehicles, fleets, transportation system and beyond, with software and AI.\nWe aspire to create a user-centred, safer, and more convenient mobility ecosystem through software and AI, because they allow everything to be connected without the constraints of time and space.\nThe first thing we\u2019ve been working on is a shift in development. When a \u201csoftware-defined\u201d approach is applied to automobiles, all features can be designed and updated based on user\u2019s mobility journey.\nSoftware can quickly improve the vehicle's user experience and safety features, driving performance, and app services. It can even define a vehicle\u2019s entire identity.\nSo through software and AI, we want to connect mobility, logistics solutions with devices and city operations systems, and transform the way the world moves. Hyundai see movement as a new source of knowledge and innovation.\nThe whole SDx journey is driven by the values of convenience and safety, which have always been a priority for Hyundai Motor Group. Using software to fulfill our \u201cService-defined, Safety-designed\u201d philosophy will help us strengthen and evolve these values even more.\nDreaming of a new mobility ecosystem with our vision for SDx\nOur vision for SDx begins with SDV (software-defined vehicle).

Under the theme \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 the company held its Media Day at the Mandalay Bay Convention Center in Las Vegas to highlight its future blueprint for a hydrogen energy ecosystem and a vision for software and artificial intelligence (AI).\nIn line with Hyundai Motor\u2019s brand vision, \u2018Progress for Humanity,\u2019 the \u2018Ease every way\u2019 theme reflects the company\u2019s aim to create a comfortable and peaceful living environment by providing three core universal values of freedom, safety, and fairness for the global community. It goes beyond the mere physical utility value of technology and caters to the complex daily lives of people, providing freedom from various limitations, safety in communities from software security and reduced greenhouse gas emissions through hydrogen, and fair accessibility to clean energy and related services.\n\"At Hyundai, we believe that science and humanity are two sides of the same coin; that advanced technology should also make people\u2019s lives better,\u201d said Jay Chang, President and CEO of Hyundai Motor Company. \u201cClean hydrogen should be for everyone, powering everything, and available everywhere.\u201d\n\u201cWe measure progress with the real and positive impact it has on humanity,\u201d said Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, President and Global COO of Hyundai Motor Company. \u201cOur theme for CES 2024, \u2018Ease every way,\u2019 is a monumental challenge. But the challenging spirit embedded in the DNA of our 56-year history will continue through the hydrogen and software transformations we\u2019ve unveiled today.\u201d\nAn innovative solution for hydrogen production, storage, transportation and utilization\nHyundai Motor Group (the Group) has already announced a commitment to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, substantiated by a clear RE100 roadmap to use 100 percent renewable energy in its overseas factories by 2045 and in every Group entity by 2050. Hydrogen energy will play a prominent role in achieving those objectives.\nFor nearly half of the company\u2019s existence, Hyundai has been at the forefront of the hydrogen momentum, achieving many firsts, including the world\u2019s first mass-produced fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs). It now has the world\u2019s highest market share in hydrogen-powered vehicle sales.\nHydrogen plays a crucial role in Hyundai\u2019s sustainability roadmap as it is a clean energy source, with water being its only byproduct when used as fuel. It also enables the maximization of renewable energy utilization worldwide due to its advantages in storage and distribution. Hyundai sees hydrogen as the path to a sustainable future, as it is both clean and accessible.\nHyundai\u2019s hydrogen solutions go beyond passenger cars, trucks and buses to include trams, special equipment, vessels, power generators and advanced air mobility. The company is driving the energy transition as a major hydrogen off-taker.\nHyundai isn\u2019t alone in its commitment to hydrogen energy. In June 2023, the U.S. published its National Clean Hydrogen Strategy and Roadmap for accelerating the production, processing, delivery, storage and use of clean hydrogen. In December at COP28, the International Hydrogen Trade Forum and the Hydrogen Council launched a suite of flagship initiatives to accelerate the commercialization of hydrogen to transition away from fossil fuels.\nTo further emphasize its commitment to hydrogen, Hyundai highlighted the expansion of HTWO\u00a0 from a fuel cell system brand into Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s hydrogen value chain business brand. HTWO now encompasses the Group\u2019s businesses and affiliates, enabling each stage of the entire clean hydrogen value chain, from production and storage to transportation and utilization. HTWO represents \u2018Hydrogen\u2019 and \u2018Humanity,\u2019 the two main pillars of Hyundai\u2019s fuel cell business.\n\u201cThe HTWO business leverages the Group\u2019s wide-ranging capabilities in various sectors, such as automobile, parts, steel, construction, air mobility, marine, robotics and future technologies,\u201d said Ken Ram\u00edrez, Executive Vice President and Head of Global Commercial Vehicle & Hydrogen Business. \u201cThe model focuses on the four core areas of the energy value chain: production, storage, transportation, and utilization. The Group\u2019s affiliates are positioned throughout the value chain, forming a hydrogen grid that allows for the development of tailored end-to-end hydrogen solutions.\u201d\nTraditionally, automakers have focused on vehicle utilization, while other industries have covered energy production, storage and transportation. This approach has led to a slow and challenging energy transition process. Hyundai aims to overcome these limitations by combining and integrating its Group-wide hydrogen competencies to revolutionize the energy transition and accelerate the establishment of a hydrogen society.\nHyundai\u2019s new identity as a sustainability player builds upon its core identity as an automobile company. One of the company\u2019s aims is to contribute to the establishment of a hydrogen society by encouraging hydrogen off-takes. Through the HTWO brand, Hyundai Motor Group projects that it will off-take 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, powering businesses, such as clean logistics, green steel production and power generation.\nDuring the presentation, Chang Hwan Kim, Senior Vice President and Head of Hydrogen Fuel Cell and Battery Development, explained that Hyundai is also developing megawatt-scale polymer electrolyte membrane (PEM) electrolyzer manufacturing capabilities for green hydrogen production, which is expected to commercialize within the next few years. Hyundai, through sharing components of fuel cell systems, plans to achieve a competitive price compared to existing PEM technologies. While the current market price of PEM electrolyzers is about 1.5 times higher than that of alkaline electrolyzers, the company is confident the price will drop below the alkaline electrolyzers through component sharing.\nFurthermore, the Group is concentrating on resource circulation hydrogen production technology that aims to transform environmental pollutants into clean hydrogen. The resource circulation technology that Hyundai focuses on includes two approaches: Waste-to-Hydrogen (W2H) and Plastic-to-Hydrogen (P2H). W2H involves the fermentation of organic waste, such as food, sludge and livestock manure, to generate biogas. This biogas is then treated to capture carbon dioxide and produce hydrogen. P2H, on the other hand, involves melting waste plastics that cannot be recycled, gasifying the molten plastics and producing hydrogen by removing unnecessary elements.\nHyundai is actively involved in various hydrogen projects globally, starting with Indonesia. The country has shown a growing interest in hydrogen as a crucial pathway to achieving carbon neutrality. There is a need to initiate hydrogen adoption at the local level to foster regional acceptance of this new energy source and drive the establishment of a hydrogen ecosystem throughout Indonesia.\nIn Indonesia, Hyundai is beginning with Waste-to-Hydrogen, through the utilization of waste from local communities, enabling the city to establish its own hydrogen production mini-hubs, eliminating the need to depend on hydrogen transportation and storage. With various off-takers entering the scene, the region will witness the formation of a hydrogen industrial cluster around the hub, thereby promoting the growth of a hydrogen society.\nCurrently, under the partnership with Indonesia, Hyundai is actively seeking the right location in West Java to deploy the HTWO grid solution. This will not only benefit Indonesia but also stands to benefit ASEAN markets in the long run, where hydrogen could play a significant role in driving both the carbon neutrality movement and economic development.\nHyundai is also actively involved in hydrogen-related demonstration projects in the U.S. where it plans to apply the HTWO Grid solution centered on utilization. This includes participation in the NorCAL ZERO project in Northern California, which involves 30 Hyundai XCIENT Fuel Cell trucks to support the decarbonization of the Port of Oakland. The Group will also play part of the \u2018Regional Clean Hydrogen Hubs\u2019 program, part of a $7 billion U.S. government initiative for hydrogen infrastructure development.\nHyundai is actively developing hydrogen solutions tailored to specific customer needs. In Georgia, it is working on the Clean Logistics Project, which revolves around the development of a hydrogen mobility value chain at Hyundai Motor Group Metaplant America (HMGMA). This dedicated electric vehicle (EV) factory under construction in Georgia expects to produce up to 300,000 EVs annually. Through the Clean Logistics Project, the Metaplant will integrate a comprehensive hydrogen value chain, commencing with the deployment of XCIENT Fuel Cell tractors to manage the logistics of the plant. Hyundai is initiating this project through utilization, backed by its Group counterparts, with the aim of establishing the foundations of a hydrogen infrastructure.\nHyundai\u2019s collaboration with various industries and sectors in Georgia is poised to generate a significant impact, attracting a diverse range of stakeholders to participate in the hydrogen value chain. This collaboration is anticipated to stimulate economic growth and create job opportunities within the state.\n\u201cHyundai's proven history with hydrogen gives Georgians a clearer picture and better understanding of this remarkable opportunity before us, as we further Georgia\u2019s position on the cutting edge of this emerging industry,\u201d said Pat Wilson, Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Economic Development. \u201cThese advancements will fuel economic growth and job opportunities in our state, and we look forward to collaborating and focusing on expanding clean technology across a variety of industries and sectors. Having seen the real-world applications already being delivered by Hyundai, we\u2019re excited that Georgia is part of Hyundai\u2019s future.\u201d\nSDx: Building a user-centered mobility ecosystem by defining vehicles, fleets and\u00a0 transportation systems with software and AI\nHyundai is undergoing a software-driven transformation led by the entire Group.

The network and controllers are designed within the SDV framework, enhancing development agility and efficiency. This increases the flexibility and scalability of the vehicle development system, enabling faster updates of user-centric features and continuous improvement of device.\nTo enhance the user experience, the Group plans to develop a new infotainment system that supports a vehicle app market. They will also provide software development kits (SDKs) for developers to create killer apps. Additionally, the Group aims to integrate its own large language model (LLM) into their AI assistant and navigation system. This integration will enable more natural and convenient user interaction and experience with enhanced user safety.\nAs SDVs become more common and standardized, management of large-scale fleets will become easier and more efficient. Beyond individual vehicles, the Group is expanding its software solutions to include software-defined fleets for businesses. These solutions offer customized fleet management services, real-time data analytics and user-friendly administrative interfaces, allowing B2B customers to operate vehicles more efficiently and address real-time issues. The Group will offer vehicle data, advanced fleet management services, data analytics and valuable insights to B2B customers of different hardware and software requirements, all without the need for separate telematics devices.\nAs vehicles, fleets and mobility in general gets defined and developed by software, they will then get AI-defined. The Group envisions vehicles evolving into \u2018AI machines\u2019 that continuously learn to better serve customers and transforming vehicles into AI machines that continuously learn to better serve customers and deploy optimized machine learning operations (MLOps). Transforming vehicles into AI machines will enable the Group to automate maintaining and updates of vehicle, simplify or eliminate tedious tasks, provide transparent data, prevent and promptly address potential issues, personalize user experiences and accelerate the enhancement of services and solutions to deliver added value for users. This will contribute to stable and efficient operation of not only devices, but also mobility, logistics, and overall urban operating system.\nThe ultimate goal is to create a concept called \u2018Cloud Transportation\u2019 where software, AI-defined devices and mobility come together to create a mobility ecosystem where transportation is easily accessible to everyone. This concept, referred to as \u2018transportation-as-a-service,\u2019 allows users to freely access transportation and mobility services as needed. Everyone, along with devices and city infrastructure, will be interconnected within an ecosystem, enabling on-demand access to transportation and automatically increasing the intelligence of mobility solutions over time. The Group is currently operating various advanced mobility services, such as demand-responsive transport and self-driving taxis, and collecting data to further advance SDV technology, including autonomous driving, to establish a foundation for Cloud Transportation.\n\u201cAs a mobility solution provider, our vision goes beyond vehicles\u201d, said Chang Song, President and Head of Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s SDV Division. \u201cIt's about empowering a mobility ecosystem. We see movement as a new source of knowledge and innovation. And our solutions and devices make that knowledge universally useful.\u201d\nThe Group presented its recent partnership with Tenstorrent, a company specializing in designing neural processing units (NPUs), further enhancing the Group\u2019s commitment to software and AI advancements.\n\u201cTenstorrent is building a silicon future that you can own. Our hardware and open source software will let you build the products you want,\u201d said Jim Keller of Tenstorrent. \u201cHyundai is building cars, factories, robots, autonomy, infotainment and smart systems. Tenstorrent is aligned with every part of that vision. We\u2019re excited to join Hyundai in gaining the independence to win the high-stakes technology race.\u201d\nIn his closing remarks, President Song highlighted the Group\u2019s ongoing dedication to user convenience and safety, which have been core values since its inception. The Group\u2019s software-development philosophy of \u2018Service-defined, safety-designed\u2019 reflects its mission to provide hassle-free mobility experiences with reliable and secure devices. By leveraging software and AI, the Group aims to develop services and solutions that meet users\u2019 needs responsively, while also taking responsibility for ensuring safety throughout all aspects of mobility, including device stability, data protection and cybersecurity.\nHydrogen value chain and software technologies on display at CES 2024\nHyundai is showcasing its waste-to-hydrogen production and hydrogen value chain as well as SDV technologies and future mobility concepts at CES 2024.
