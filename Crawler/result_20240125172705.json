        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

The program was ALL ON for CES 2024, receiving more than 3000 submissions, a record high and a 40% increase over CES 2023.\nEach year, an independent panel of industry expert judges, including members of the media, designers and engineers, reviews and rates submissions based on innovation, functionality, aesthetic, and design. Those rated the highest across all categories receive the Best of Innovation designation.\nFor the CES 2024 program, the top two categories by number of submissions were \u2018digital health\u2019 and \u2018sustainability, eco-design & smart energy.\u2019 This trend underscores the rapid pace of innovation in sectors that promise to solve big global challenges and improve human lives \u2013 a major theme at the show as CTA partners with the UN Trust Fund for Human Security and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS) to advance human security. For the first time, the Best of Innovation list for CES 2024 includes a product from the \u2018Human Security\u2019 category, introduced at CES 2023.\nThe CES 2024 Innovation Awards also features a new category \u2013 artificial intelligence (AI). The AI category received 7% of all applications, underscoring that innovators are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of AI in shaping the future of technology.

Why can\u2019t we Louboutin and Nike have a baby?\nHere are some things you need to know when looking for comfortable heels.\nThere are two broad categories of why it is so challenging to make heels comfortable. First, it is about physics and second it is about proper fit.\nThe physics problem is actually easier to deal with. In a 3 inch heel only 20% of the foot is in contact with the shoe. Pressure is concentrated in the ball joint of the foot (metatarsal) and the heel (calcaneus). In physics the formula is Pressure= Force/surface area. With the surface area reduced to 20% it is logical that pressure is greatly increased. Enrico Cuini invented ALIA which stands for Active Lift In Alignment to increase the surface area in contact with the foot and therefore reducing the pressure felt particular at the metatarsal joint. A high heel is also challenging to wear especially if the heel is thin because it feels unstable. ALIA gives more stability because of the shape which curves to support all three arches of the mid foot: medial, lateral and transverse. The dome of the foot is supported properly by addressing all three elements of the dome instead of only supporting the medial arch which is in standard orthotics. ALIA also promotes stability by having increased surface area in contact with the sole and therefore touching more proprioceptive receptors to providing the brain feedback about where the body is in space. Lastly, ALIA also provides better energy return because it is in touch with the foot and responds dynamically over the gait cycle by opening up upon weight bearing and releasing the energy stored in the motion reducing dissipation of energy. All of these features makes a shoe built with ALIA technology more comfortable especially high heels.\nIn a high heel it is critical that the fit is precise because the upper of the shoe must block the foot from sliding forward into the toe box due to the effect of gravity. The current way that shoes are sold after mass production of one standard \u201csize\u201d is not conducive to a good fit. First let\u2019s look at the sizing system. The current size system only measures length and a few brands offer different widths. The status quo does not take into account the various different volume of the foot or different proportions. People buy shoes by seeing what is the closest they can find to fit them and rarely is it precise. An example is that two people can have the exact same length of foot but one is very sleek and narrow while the other is more broad. There are also many other potential proportion variations.\nThe current market sells mass produced shoes based on volume and shape that this based on a tradition of western foot types since designer shoes mostly come from Italy. The entire world full of different proportions and volume must try to make due with what is available. It is too expensive for brands to offer the multitudes of options to fit a population properly. Stores cannot possibly carry the vast amount of inventory needed and it would be too complex to teach sales associates how to properly size a customer if one has to consider more than just length. These are all big challenges and limitations of the current retail system.\nAt Enrico Cuini we strive the make the most comfortable heels in the world even in sexy high stilettos. Therefore we created an entirely new way of selling shoes. Our shoes are made to order and made to the specifications of your feet. This would insure the most precise fit. We offer 32 different standard options and customizations to accommodate your unique feet. If necessary we can also make an entirely custom shoe for you. Prices vary based on the amount of work required. We have created a sophisticated measuring system using image recognition and AI to avoid the difficulty of training sales staff. You can buy shoes online and send in photos of your feet to be analyzed or book a virtual fitting on Zoom. We also have live events around the country.\nIn the future for retailers who would like to represent our brand, our technology will aid in determining best size options and the data will help improve inventory mix. Our clients are happy to wait 4-6 weeks for their shoes because they no longer need to wonder \u201cwhat is my size?\u2019 The proper answer is \u201cYOUR size\u201d."

Beauty, however, can hurt when wearing something that feels unnatural to the foot. Enrico Cuini has cutting-edge tech called ALIA to help increase the performance and comfort of a sexy high-heeled shoe. Here are some things to note about ALIA technology.\nALIA Technology\nALIA stands for Active Lift in Alignment. The technology makes high heels comfortable by decreasing the pressure on the balls of feet and increasing the surface area of support, helping to disperse force across the entire sole. It helps women get a better and more dynamic support system and puts the joints in the optimal position of alignment so the muscles and joints can work in the most ideal position.\u00a0 Women also have greater stability even in high, thin, needle-like heels and have improved energy return.\nThink of ALIA technology as an assisted walking system to keep ladies floating through their work day and beyond evening happy hour. The fashionable and functional motif of the brand shows that women can remain stylish while empowered by their heels.\nProducts\nCuini has various shoes for women such as peep-toes, boots, booties, sandals, loafers, pumps, slingbacks, and mules. Additionally, they have sneakers for more casual or athletic endeavors. Clients will feel comfortable wearing these shoes to help them in their personal and professional lifestyles.\nThe high-end brand is produced exclusively in their private Italian factory and delivered directly to customers from made-to-order sales.\u00a0 Their products are available online and at pop-up events around the country where customers fly hours to attend appointments to consult with Enrico Cuini himself. Their clients are smart, sexy women who set their goals high and wear their heels even higher.\nAbout Enrico Cuini\nEnrico Cuini started his journey in 1997 by sketching some shoes for Taryn Rose. Cuini was in the architectural business but always had a passion for sexy heels having watched his mother dress up and growing up in one of the largest shoe-making centers in Italy.\nAlthough Cuini and Rose went down separate paths after the initial meeting, Cuini got back into making shoes by using his experience in designing, engineering, and material science to invent the \u201cWing Shoe\u201d technology (part of the inspiration came from seeing a butterfly in his studio window) and now named ALIA. The butterfly continues to be a symbol of his \u201cWing\u201d movement to help him reach his highest potential and build a community around service and care for others.\nMedia Contact\nEnrico Cuini\nShare this article:\nThank you for contact with Us.\nWe will get back soon.\nHave any questions?\ninfo@issuewire.com\nCopyright \u00a9 2022 IssueWire."

Why can\u2019t we Louboutin and Nike have a baby?\nHere are some things you need to know when looking for comfortable heels.\nThere are two broad categories of why it is so challenging to make heels comfortable. First, it is about physics and second it is about proper fit.\nThe physics problem is actually easier to deal with. In a 3 inch heel only 20% of the foot is in contact with the shoe. Pressure is concentrated in the ball joint of the foot (metatarsal) and the heel (calcaneus). In physics the formula is Pressure= Force/surface area. With the surface area reduced to 20% it is logical that pressure is greatly increased. Enrico Cuini invented ALIA which stands for Active Lift In Alignment to increase the surface area in contact with the foot and therefore reducing the pressure felt particular at the metatarsal joint. A high heel is also challenging to wear especially if the heel is thin because it feels unstable. ALIA gives more stability because of the shape which curves to support all three arches of the mid foot: medial, lateral and transverse. The dome of the foot is supported properly by addressing all three elements of the dome instead of only supporting the medial arch which is in standard orthotics. ALIA also promotes stability by having increased surface area in contact with the sole and therefore touching more proprioceptive receptors to providing the brain feedback about where the body is in space. Lastly, ALIA also provides better energy return because it is in touch with the foot and responds dynamically over the gait cycle by opening up upon weight bearing and releasing the energy stored in the motion reducing dissipation of energy. All of these features makes a shoe built with ALIA technology more comfortable especially high heels.\nIn a high heel it is critical that the fit is precise because the upper of the shoe must block the foot from sliding forward into the toe box due to the effect of gravity. The current way that shoes are sold after mass production of one standard \u201csize\u201d is not conducive to a good fit. First let\u2019s look at the sizing system. The current size system only measures length and a few brands offer different widths. The status quo does not take into account the various different volume of the foot or different proportions. People buy shoes by seeing what is the closest they can find to fit them and rarely is it precise. An example is that two people can have the exact same length of foot but one is very sleek and narrow while the other is more broad. There are also many other potential proportion variations.\nThe current market sells mass produced shoes based on volume and shape that this based on a tradition of western foot types since designer shoes mostly come from Italy. The entire world full of different proportions and volume must try to make due with what is available. It is too expensive for brands to offer the multitudes of options to fit a population properly. Stores cannot possibly carry the vast amount of inventory needed and it would be too complex to teach sales associates how to properly size a customer if one has to consider more than just length. These are all big challenges and limitations of the current retail system.\nAt Enrico Cuini we strive the make the most comfortable heels in the world even in sexy high stilettos. Therefore we created an entirely new way of selling shoes. Our shoes are made to order and made to the specifications of your feet. This would insure the most precise fit. We offer 32 different standard options and customizations to accommodate your unique feet. If necessary we can also make an entirely custom shoe for you. Prices vary based on the amount of work required. We have created a sophisticated measuring system using image recognition and AI to avoid the difficulty of training sales staff. You can buy shoes online and send in photos of your feet to be analyzed or book a virtual fitting on Zoom. We also have live events around the country.\nIn the future for retailers who would like to represent our brand, our technology will aid in determining best size options and the data will help improve inventory mix. Our clients are happy to wait 4-6 weeks for their shoes because they no longer need to wonder \u201cwhat is my size?\u2019 The proper answer is \u201cYOUR size\u201d."

Look closely to spot companies like L\u2019Or\u00e9al, Procter & Gamble, Fossil, Perfect Corp. and others that are eager to tell their innovation stories, identify intriguing new partnerships or show off their newest advancements, products and projects.\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Group\u2019s fascination with hardware and beauty intelligence led the company to introduce two new makeup application devices at the show called Hapta and Brow Magic. Guive Balooch, global vice president of L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s tech incubator, told WWD that they feed into a broader goal of using tech to ensure \u201cour fingers and hands will no longer be the barrier to achieving our desired results.\u201d\nRelated Articles\nThe 30 Best Slip Dresses and How to Style Them in 2024\nEntire Studios Expands Womenswear, Launches Denim\nUnlike previous years, Procter & Gamble didn\u2019t unveil new products or stage an exhibition this time. But it made its presence known by sending Kelly Anderson, director of research and development for data science and artificial intelligence, to talk about the company\u2019s approach to data science and partnering with start-ups to keep the fresh ideas and innovations flowing.\n\u201cAI and data \u2014 high-quality, owned data \u2014 is part of our digital transformation strategy to disrupt how we innovate, bringing products to market faster and better and cheaper,\u201d Anderson said in exclusive comments to WWD. \u201cIt\u2019s helping to really understand the consumer behavior very deeply, what they are aspiring to achieve, and helping us to design the best products possible to achieve that for them.\n\u201cWe are strategically partnering externally, both with academics, obviously, for basic sciences understanding, [and] with start-ups, especially as, in the AI world, technology moves from academia to start-ups to large business very, very quickly.\u201d\nPerfect Corp., the AI and augmented reality platform for beauty and increasingly accessories, has become a regular at CES as well. Just ahead of the show, the company announced a virtual try-on solution for eyewear, with a \u201cstreamlined automated modeling process simplifies 3D sku creation by introducing an easy-to-adopt self-service platform for brands to digitize their product range in a fraction of the time,\u201d according to the company.\nIn essence, the 3D virtual eyewear creation process it devised was created to replace complicated, multidimensional scanning processes with automatic 3D renderings \u201cusing just three flat product images to create a unique live camera preview.\u201d\nAdam Gant, Perfect Corp.\u2019s chief marketing officer, was also spotted at a CES panel on solving retail\u2019s biggest challenges. The talk centered on the six particular tech trends the company identified, including sustainability, physical retail\u2019s comeback, AI-based skin technology, the rise of AI and AR for fashion accessories, the intelligence of personalization and virtual commerce via Web 3.0 and other immersive experiences.\nNaturally, the larger show punctuates some of those points, particularly the latter, as dozens of exhibitors kept mixed reality, NFT and blockchain, metaverse, Web 3.0 and related trends front of mind.\nWWD caught up with one tech company whose wearable tech aims to bridge fashion and a virtual experience similar to augmented reality, but in a more practical way. Vuzix announced a new Ultralite reference device that extends smartphone notifications in a visual way to the eyes, but without the bulk and annoyingly short battery life.\nAs Paul Travers, president, chief executive officer and founder of Vuzix, explained to WWD, the company\u2019s approach to waveguide technology allows for a slimmer form factor without skimping on resolution and quality. \u201cIt\u2019s all about thin and sexy [and] fashion-forward,\u201d he said. \u201cThe displays can be super tiny, up in the corner hidden in the frames. And the lenses are 0.6 millimeters thin. So you\u2019ve got this form factor that you can put in glasses.\u201d\nThe premise seems particularly interesting, given the buzz about Apple reportedly on the verge of releasing its own smart glasses or mixed reality headset. So it\u2019s no surprise that major technology and fashion-related brands showed interest in the Ultralite. Travers didn\u2019t name specific companies, but hinted at the feasibility of the Ultralite reference design arriving under the banner of a globally recognizable consumer brand as early as this fall.\nWearable tech and fashion has become so irresistible, even celebrities like Paula Abdul are getting into the act. The dancer/singer saw fit to bring her IdolEyes Fashion Audio Glasses to CES, while plenty of wrist gizmos were spotted, too, including Fossil\u2019s latest sixth-generation, wellness-oriented hybrid watch.\nApparently fashion-focused technology has moved from the face and hands all the way down to the feet as well. Indeed, luxury footwear designer Enrico Cuini worked with orthopedic surgeon Dr. Taryn Rose to create a line of high-end men\u2019s and women\u2019s shoes that promise the ultimate in fit and comfort, thanks to the development of their ALIA, or Active Lift in Alignment, support technology.\nThe system uses computer vision and intelligence for personalized, made-to-measure fit. The shoes \u201cdissipate pressure across a greater foot surface area to dynamically allow for pressure relief, stability and energy return, making even the highest, sexiest stilettos amazingly comfortable,\u201d the announcement read.\nFor the attendees that made it out to CES this year \u2014 which, at some 112,000 or so in the final tally, amount to a little more than half of the usual crowd \u2014\u00a0they were rewarded with gonzo spectacles across an array of eye-grabbing technologies.\nThe most obvious to the casual onlooker were futuristic, bendable displays in televisions and automotive innovation for self-driving cars, electric vehicles, infotainment systems and more. If that didn\u2019t snag attention, certainly the transportation options did. After all, how often does one shoot through the color-lit underground tunnels beneath the Las Vegas Convention Center in a free chauffeured Tesla?\nBut there was more going on under the surface of the show, and for fashion and beauty, it\u2019s clear that innovation will continue lighting the way this year and beyond.\nTags\nSign up for WWD news straight to your inbox every day\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Elle\u00a0Fanning\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes With Christian Friedel\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Gina Torres and Sarah Rafferty\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Jo Koy\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Sheryl Lee Ralph\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Heidi Klum\nWatch WWD's Style Awards: Golden Globes 2024!\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Amanda Seyfried\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Natasha Lyonne\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Quinta Brunson\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes With Mark Ronson And Grace Gummer\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Lily Gladstone\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Helen Mirren\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Keri Russell\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Colman Domingo\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Rosamund Pike\nWWD Eye on the Golden Globes With Kieran Culkin\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Elizabeth Debicki\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes With Ayo Edebiri\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes With Michelle Yeoh\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Angela Bassett\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Natalie Portman\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Hari Nef\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Sandra Huller\nWWD Eye On the Golden Globes Red Carpet With Tyler James Williams\nMost Popular\nWorst Dressed at the 2023 Emmy Awards\nJeremy Allen White's Underwear Campaign Generates $12.7 Million in\u2026\nWorst Dressed at Critics Choice Awards 2024\nCalvin Klein's Spring Campaign Puts the Spotlight on Jeremy Allen\u2026\nBest Dressed at Golden Globes 2024\nGet all the top news stories and alerts straight to your inbox.\nThe Essentialist\nTop Golden Globes Beauty Trend: Nude\u00a0Lips\nYes, You Can Shop Gillian Anderson\u2019s Stunning\u2026\nHi, Barbie!
