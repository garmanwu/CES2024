        "raw_content": "Automotive\nArtificial Intelligence Becomes new \u2018Driving\u2019 Force of Automobiles at CES 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 highlighted the increasing role of artificial intelligence (AI) as the driving force behind the automotive industry. Established automakers are intensifying their efforts to catch up with digital features that have set companies like Tesla and BYD apart, signaling a shift towards what the industry terms \u201csoftware-defined vehicles.\u201d\nUnlike the traditional focus on horsepower and towing capabilities, the contemporary automotive landscape places a significant emphasis on software-driven enhancements. More than a decade after Tesla introduced cars with upgradable over-the-air software, mainstream automakers are still striving to develop similar capabilities.\nThe transition to software-dominated cars presents a unique set of challenges. Vehicles must meet higher standards for durability and safety compared to consumer electronics, and the fast-paced evolution of AI systems like ChatGPT poses a challenge due to their error-prone nature and rapid development cycles.\nMercedes-Benz has ventured into a \u201cbeta program\u201d to test ChatGPT AI technology, aiming to facilitate natural dialogues between drivers and the vehicle\u2019s infotainment systems. This departure from traditional testing methods signifies a broader shift in the industry. Mercedes is not only allowing customers to test a system under development but is also adapting its IT infrastructure, manufacturing lines, and dealership processes to accommodate faster software updates.\nEfforts by established automakers to match technology industry software capabilities have incurred substantial costs, with occasional setbacks. General Motors faced challenges with the Chevrolet Blazer EV due to software-related glitches, leading to a temporary halt in sales. In contrast, Tesla\u2019s use of over-the-air updates exemplifies a more seamless approach to software revisions.\nThe challenge to develop software architectures comparable to Tesla\u2019s capabilities has been described as a \u201csteep challenge\u201d by industry experts. Volkswagen, after restructuring its Cariad software operation, is now seeking technology industry partnerships to expedite its efforts.\nAt CES, Volkswagen announced a collaboration with Cerence, a U.S. software developer, to integrate ChatGPT into its cars later in the year. Chinese automakers are also making significant strides in the AI-driven EV market, with in-vehicle displays offering advanced infotainment functions.\nTo stay competitive, Japanese automaker Honda formed a joint venture with Sony in 2022. The Sony Honda Mobility venture aims to combine Honda\u2019s vehicle engineering experience with Sony\u2019s software and gaming expertise for a new line of EVs set to launch in 2025.\nHowever, the challenge extends beyond development to consumer adoption. While some automakers are introducing subscription fees for software-powered features, consumer willingness to pay for such features remains a concern. Analysts and industry executives suggest that the window for adding fees for new software functions is limited, emphasizing the importance of meeting consumer demands within the next three to five years.\nSource:\nYou May Also Like\nSearch\nAutomotive Manufacturers & Categories\nLatest Test Drive Reviews\nPopular How-To Guides"

Autovista24 special content editor, Phil Curry, considers where this road could take the industry.\nJust two letters encapsulated the majority of discussions and launches at CES 2024 \u2013 AI. Every sector appeared invested in artificial intelligence, and the automotive market was no exception.\nFrom personal assistants to predictive maintenance, AI could revolutionise mobility. However, understanding the technology is a complex task, as is the process of using it to gain results.\nBut almost all carmakers appear to be working on AI strategies. Some are planning simple integrations in the near future, while others are working on utilising the technology inside and outside the vehicle.\nHuge potential\nIn a panel session presented by EY, the potential of AI in the automotive market was discussed, along with the needs of the industry to ensure it can work as effectively as possible.\nSabine Scheunert, former vice president of digital and IT sales/marketing at Mercedes-Benz, said: \u2018Today, there is not a single carmaker that is not utilising AI. It starts with the clear potential of huge efficiency and helps to shorten the development cycle of new vehicles, which is a real efficiency driver. It is also useful in production lines, especially with quality management.\n\u2018However, AI also has an important part to play in the customer journey. Call centres are integrating bots into their systems, and these can sufficiently answer the requests of the customers. So, in customer experience terms, the use of AI in the automotive industry has huge potential,\u2019 she added.\nThree AI areas\n\u2018By 2030, we expect $74.5 billion (\u20ac68.5 billion) will have been invested in AI by automotive companies, the question now is, what do we do with that money, and how do we commercialise it?\u2019 commented Constantin Gall, managing partner at EY.\n\u2018We see three areas where AI can help benefit the mobility market: proactive care, proactive journey and proactive mobility.\u2019\nProactive journey could see AI examine a driver\u2019s commute and schedule to ensure efficient time management, also examining traffic trends. Proactive mobility complements autonomous driving, as AI brings augmented reality and in-car infotainment, benefitting users while the car is in motion.\nProactive care will see car owners offered a hassle-free experience when it comes to their vehicles. AI could take care of admin and logistics, such as insuring the vehicle, booking maintenance and even predicting potential issues. However, it may also offer proactive communication and recommendations, leaving the financial decisions up to the driver.\nThis means AI could help to maintain customer loyalty, especially when it comes to electric vehicles (EVs) which are subject to less maintenance. The technology could help ensure drivers interact with original manufacturers instead of considering a third party.\nBenefitting aftersales\nScheunert highlighted how AI could have a crucial role to play in keeping customers loyal to brands through predictive maintenance.\nAs cars get older, they will end up moving out of the franchised dealer servicing schemes and into the independent repair sector. Scheunert suggested that aftersales is not an area that OEMs currently concentrate on.\n\u2018It can cost around seven times more to reconquer a customer you have lost to bring them back to your aftersales service,\u2019 Scheunert stated. \u2018The aftersales area is certainly a market where AI can be developed further to benefit.\n\u2018Vehicles today have a lot of sensoric information, monitoring everything that is happening around the car, including breakdowns or damaged parts. The next step is to connect the data to allow for a prediction on whether a part is close to the end of its life, but then also connecting to suppliers to ship this part to the nearest service centre, or even to the customer with instructions of how to fit the part themselves,\u2019 she said.\nInvestment black hole\nThe AI options and potential benefits to businesses and consumers alike are vast. To utilise the technology fully, the correct data needs to be generated and analysed, with systems required to process all the information. Otherwise, carmakers and suppliers risk pouring millions into a black hole of development.\n\u2018There is still a lack of real understanding of how the automotive industry can put AI to good use, in order to meet the user experience we would like to see,\u2019 stated Damian Barnett, Luxoft CTO.\n\u2018We need to make sure we are creating the right data, to allow us to collect the data we need and drive the results that we would like to see coming out of AI,\u2019 he added.\nCarmakers working on AI\nAlongside the discussions, there were plenty of automotive businesses at CES 2024 revealing their AI plans.\nBMW Group announced the integration of generative AI into its voice assistant. Together with its partner Amazon, the carmaker showcased a new system powered by the Alexa large-language model (LLM). The current development project is creating the foundations for a potential rollout.\nComplex processing capabilities, which enable human-like interactions and conversations, have not yet been integrated into BMW vehicles. This is now made possible by LLMs, which are trained on enormous sets of data, allowing them to generate plausible language.\nMercedes-Benz is also integrating generative AI into its MBUX virtual assistant. The carmaker is aiming to make user interactions more human-like.\n\u2018The Mercedes-Benz user experience of tomorrow will be hyper-personalised. With generative AI, our MBUX virtual assistant brings more trust and empathy to the relationship between car and driver,\u2019 commented Magnus \u00d6stberg, chief software officer, Mercedes-Benz AG.\n\u2018Thanks to our MB.OS chip-to-cloud architecture, our future vehicles will provide customers with exactly what they need when they need it.\u2019\nThe carmaker explained that its MBUX virtual assistant uses generative AI and proactive intelligence to make life as easy, convenient and comfortable as possible. The system can offer helpful suggestions based on learned behaviour and situational context. Examples include playing the latest news in the morning or starting a preferred massage programme at the end of the working day.\nThe AI can also learn a driver\u2019s movements and schedule, and link into digital calendars, to offer options should circumstances change. This may include automatically preparing a call should the user be running late for an appointment. The system can also learn individual driver preferences and prepare the vehicle accordingly, including music choices and ambient lighting.\nChatGPT comes to cars\nOne of the most well-known AI chatbots, ChatGPT, is to be utilised by Volkswagen (VW), with the system integrated into the carmaker\u2019s IDA voice assistant by Cerence Chat Pro. This means the technology can offer new functionality and respond to drivers with detailed answers while understanding their basic needs and reacting to them.\n\u2018Thanks to the seamless integration of ChatGPT and strong collaboration with our partner, Cerence, we are offering our drivers added value and direct access to the AI-based research tool,\u2019 commented Kai Gr\u00fcnitz, member of the board of management at VW responsible for technical development.\nThe integration of AI helps to keep the cabin experience intuitive and personalised, while also giving the driver the information they need when required.\n\u2018With the rise of generative AI and LLMs we are now entering a new era of computing, large language models will become the new AI agents, enabling a single conversational interface across applications, based on users\u2019 personal preferences,\u2019 said Stefan Ortmanns, CEO of Cerence.\n\u2018This will help to transform the in-car assistant into a human-like companion. Our smart arbitration, embedded in the VW solution, directs questions, routes, and specific voice commands, and allows VW to feed the system with customised information,\u2019 he said.\nUsing AI, VW says the IDA voice assistant can be used to control the infotainment, navigation, and air conditioning, or to answer general knowledge questions. In the future, AI will provide additional information in response to more complex questions as part of its continuously expanding capabilities.\nAdvancing the use of AI\nSony provided an update on its Sony Honda Mobility (SHM) business, including a new partnership with Microsoft. This collaboration aims to develop a conversational personal agent using the Azure OpenAI service.\n\u2018Generative AI is a new canvas that is amplifying human creativity and creating opportunities for creators and designers to completely transform the in-vehicle experience,\u2019 stated Jessica Hawk, corporate vice president, data, AI, digital applications and product marketing at Microsoft.\n\u2018As these new technologies come forward, safe and responsible AI will continue to be a top priority for both Microsoft and Sony.\u2019\nSHM is also looking to build upon both automated driving and advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) by using AI in mobility. The company is adopting Vison Transformer, a deep-learning model for natural language processing, which also specialises in image recognition.\nThis will improve how ADAS can perceive the world, alongside greater path planning thanks to machine learning. Cars will be able to see the road ahead more clearly and consider hazards, before taking appropriate action such as applying brakes. This means AI will play a significant role in vehicle safety.\nOverall, the automotive industry is still learning about AI and its potential. With most official announcements centring on integration with personal assistants, it is clear the market is only beginning to take note of the technology.\nAs the connected car continues to evolve, more AI integration can be expected. This stands to benefit the driver and give automotive brands the opportunity to retain customer loyalty, as well as monetise additional services.\nShare this article\nDeliver better outcomes across multiple departments\n09 January 2024\n03 January 2024\n14 December 2023\n08 December 2023\nTop\nAutovista24 \u00a9 2024"

He added that the company was undergoing a fundamental shift in how it sees itself, from a wireless communication company to being a connected processor and artificial intelligence company.\n\u201cWe have been very passionate about the role of AI in the devices that we carry. We\u2019ve been talking about on-device [AI for a long time] and it our job was [to make] a computing engine that is going to make that technology run pervasive,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWe are at a point that those capabilities in the processors in the semiconductors are becoming available. The next step will be the development stages and the applications. The next form of computing, which is accelerated computing for AI, is going to happen everywhere. We\u2019ve been busy developing technologies that allow you to do that without compromising battery life.\u201d\nWhile noting the essential part cloud is playing in the current digital world, Amon said he found it interesting how AI in devices was seen to be developing differently from the cloud. He said devices were the core of personalisation, with devices having more knowledge of users\u2019 preferences and workstyles. Development would see devices having the ability to run very large AI language models, with billions of possible parameters for instant responses to queries. All of this, Amon predicted, would result in a change in user experience.\n\u201cYou are going to have this assistance that is going to be there with you [and the device] is going to learn from your behaviour. And that\u2019s where [the intersection is] about doing AI on the devices,\u201d he said.\n\u201cWhen you do a query on the cloud, you provide some information [for it] to know you and to give you an answer. But when you provide the cloud and the device working together, devices will [have] context such as where you are, who you are, and what the relevance of that information is \u2013 and I think that\u2019s what makes it all this very exciting and transformative.\u201d\nAt CES 2024, this transformation was most pronounced in automotives. Having established a legacy of providing some essential building blocks for smart phones, computers and other business devices, Qualcomm is now gearing up to be at the heart of the new automotive industry, tapping into to manufacturers\u2019 rapid increase in the electrification of product lines, leading to a sharp increase in in-car electronics such as digital cockpits, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and in-vehicle infotainment.\nEarlier at CES, Qualcomm announced a range of automotive products based on its Snapdragon Digital Chassis platform to support next-generation digital cockpits, connected car technologies, connected services, advanced driver assistance and automated driving systems.\nPutting the launch of the new product line into context, Amon described cars as a new computing space and that, by extension, CES is now \u201ca car show, among other things\u201d.\n\u201cThere\u2019s fundamentally one thing that is different now. I look at that as the foundation of many of the things we\u2019re doing with the Snapdragon digital cockpit and some of the rapid success we had an automotive,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe car is a new computing space \u2013 that\u2019s probably the best way I can describe it. We have a number of examples of this at the show. Salesforce is embedded into the Snapdragon Digital cockpit, so you can do CRM in the car.\n\u201cInsurance companies want to embed their services into the car. You have distribution of television content, gaming...so the car is a new community space and that is a revolution that is going to create a huge opportunity for different companies, and Qualcomm provides that digital engine.\u201d\nRead more about CES 2024\nMany organizations recognize the importance of edge computing.
