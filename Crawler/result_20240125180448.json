        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Together, we can create a brighter future by shaping opinions, driving conversations, and transforming ideas into reality.\nIn partnership with renowned French glass manufacturer Saint-Gobain Sekurit, LG Electronics (LG) has announced today that it will be unveiling its cutting-edge and next-generation transparent antenna that will enhance telecommunication for automobiles at the upcoming CES 2024, slated for January in Las Vegas.\nThe transparent film-type antenna, according to the tech giant, is poised to be a game-changer in this rapidly evolving landscape of the automobile industry.\nWith electric vehicles becoming the norm and the imminent arrival of autonomous and software-defined vehicles, the automotive industry is on the brink of a connectivity revolution.\nLG\u2019s Transparent Film-type Antenna: Elevating Car Telecommunications\nLG\u2019s transparent telematics solution offers a transformative approach to in-vehicle connectivity. This cutting-edge antenna can be installed directly on car glass and is made to work with many kinds of glass and car designs, so the integration procedure will be smooth.

It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium.

It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024.

        "raw_content": "Antenna Specification Explanation\nAntenna Basics and Tips on Antenna Selection - Datasheet Terms explanation\nAntenna Basics and Tips on Antenna Selection\nSelecting the right antenna is a critical step during the design and development steps of any connected device. An antenna must be compatible with the receiver specifications and meet device/application requirements such as size, weight, environmental and mechanical. It is important to understand the antenna capabilities and how the specifications meet the device requirements perfectly. Each antenna has a detailed specifications datasheet that can be found under the product details website section.\nThis guideline provides additional information that expands each datasheet section with a description to assist our customers in selecting the perfect antenna.\nIdentify your needs\nMounting Types\nThe initial step during the antenna selection is to determine what mounting type is suitable to meet the application requirements. In order to select the most optimized antenna, start by confirming if the antenna will be integrated internally, such as a mobile device or externally which often comes with housing for protection in outdoor application and installation. 2J Antennas offers a large selection for internal and external single and combination antenna mounting types.\nExternal Single and Combination Antennas Mounting types\nInternal Single and Combination Antennas Mounting types\nFrequency and Wavelength\nThe wireless band designated for a device to operate through is called frequency. Antennas are designed to have a range of frequencies to operate within. As an example, if a device is tuned to use Band 17(700MHz), the corresponding antenna must operate within 704 and 746 MHz for transmission and reception.\nThe wavelength is the distance radio waves travel during one cycle. Designing an antenna quarter wavelength long will provide the best efficiency and deliver the highest signal quality.\nQuarter wavelength is calculated with the following formula:Quarter Wavelength(mm) = (75/ FreqMHz)*1,000\nIMPORTANT: 4GLTE and 3G/2G antennas have the potential to be used in applications requiring ISM standards. 4GLTE range specification of 698-960MHz and 3G/2G from 824-960MHz, meaning the ISM 868MHz standards operate from 863-870MHz and are located within the 4GLTE and 3G/2G range. The same applies for ISM 915MHz standards that operate within 902-928MHz, or dual band 868/915MHz.\nTo ensure proper compatibility, please contact our sales department for further analysis.\nFig.1, Examples of 1/4 wavelength; Frequency / Length graph\nStandards & Bands\n2J Antennas offers antennas that operate within many global standards. As example, our 4G LTE antennas are compatible with Cat-M, Cat-X, Cat-NB, NB-IoT and also SigFox and LoRa, known as LPWA market. The same analogy can apply often to other frequencies. As an example, WIFI antennas can be used for SigFox or LoRa in the 2.4 GHz spectrum.GNSS antennas are available with pre-filter, mid-filter or no-filter to meet the customers' different requirements. The pre-filter offers the highest resistance and best reception and therefore is standard on all GNSS antennas. It is important to compare active gain and noise on the amplifier of GNSS antennas.\nAntenna standards We offer:- 5GNR/4GLTE/FirstNet/CBRS/LPWA/3G/2G- 4GLTE/FirstNet/NB-IoT/Cat-X-Mx-NBx/LPWA- 3G/2G- 2.4-5.0GHz WiFi/Bluetooth/ISM- IRIDIUM- GPS/GLONASS/BeiDou/QZSS/Galileo- 433/868/915MHz/LPWA/Sigfox/LoRa\u00a0 /RFID/ZigBee/ISM- TETRA/UHF/PMR/LMR- 169MHz/ERMES/VHF- DECAWAVE- DSRC/C-V2X- ORBCOMM- AIS- DAB- HDTV/DVBT- AM/FM\nFig.2, Frequency showing Standards Graph\nTerms Explanation\nPart of antenna selection is not only to identify the specification needs but also compare other products. It is important to understand the parameters in which the antennas are tested and measured to achieve the most reliable performance results. To help our customers find the best product, we have highlighted some of the key points to pay close attention to during antenna selection and comparison.\nTesting Parameters\nTesting parameters and testing methods can vary from manufacturer to manufacturer. Testing methods should always be fully disclosed such as free space, metal plate, plastic plate, glass, etc. Installing antennas outside of testing parameters will result in undesired antenna performance. For example, if a screw mount antenna is measured in free space showing optimal performance results and is installed on a metal surface in the customer device, the antenna will not operate as expected. 2J Antennas will always disclose the complete measurement conditions to assure our customers get the most accurate data making the in-device integration of an antenna successful. In order to make a smart product selection between two manufacturers, we encourage that all testing should be completed with a standard length and high-quality cable in order to optimize antenna performance results. No alterations during testing such as shorter or no cables should be performed. This will result in inaccurate efficiency, peak gain and average gain results.\n2J Antennas values transparency. This is important when comparing antenna products from different manufacturers.\nReturn Loss\nThe return loss is measured in decibels (dB) and represents how much energy is transferred from the device to the antenna. The lower the measurement the better. For a 50 Ohm system, it is recommended to have a minimum of -5dB or better measurement. Using the return loss to identify how the impedance of the antenna performs across the entire spectrum can help to estimate the bandwidth and operating frequencies.\nVSWR\nVoltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) is another parameter used to measure how much energy is transferred from the device to the antenna but with a different mathematical scale than the one used for Return Loss. The lower the measurement the better, meaning closer to a 50 Ohm system and it is recommended to have a maximum of 3.5 VSWR. Please review the table below to learn more about the relationship between Return Loss and VSWR as well as other RF parameters and values.\nReturnLoss (dB)\nVSWR\nReflection Coefficient, \u0393\nMismatch Loss (dB)\nReflected Power (%)\nThrough Power (%)\n-1\n17.39\n0.89\n6.87\n79.43\n20.57\n-2\n8.72\n0.79\n4.33\n63.10\n36.90\n-3\n5.85\n0.71\n3.2\n50.12\n49.88\n-4\n4.42\n0.63\n2.20\n39.81\n60.19\n-5\n3.57\n0.56\n1.65\n31.62\n68.38\n-6\n3.1\n0.50\n1.26\n25.12\n74.88\n-7\n2.61\n0.45\n0.97\n19.95\n80.05\n-8\n2.32\n0.40\n0.75\n15.85\n84.15\n-9\n2.10\n0.36\n0.58\n12.59\n87.41\n-10\n1.92\n0.32\n0.46\n10.00\n90.00\n-11\n1.78\n0.28\n0.36\n7.94\n92.06\n-12\n1.67\n0.25\n0.28\n6.31\n93.69\n-13\n1.58\n0.22\n0.22\n5.01\n94.99\n-14\n1.50\n0.20\n0.18\n3.98\n96.02\n-15\n1.43\n0.18\n0.14\n3.16\n96.84\n-16\n1.38\n0.16\n0.11\n2.51\n97.49\n-17\n1.33\n0.14\n0.09\n2.00\n98.00\n-18\n1.29\n0.13\n0.07\n1.58\n98.42\n-19\n1.25\n0.11\n0.06\n1.26\n98.74\n-20\n1.22\n0.10\n0.04\n1.00\n99.00\nTable 1, Return Loss to VSWR Conversion Table, and more RF parameters.\nBandwidth\nBandwidth is a range of frequencies. A short frequency range is a narrow band and wider frequency range is categorized as a wideband. It is important to select the right antenna with the matching bandwidth as narrowband and wideband are not interchangeable.\nEfficiency\nAntenna efficiency (radiation efficiency) is a measure of the electrical efficiency in which a radio antenna converts the radio frequency power received into radiated power. In other words means how much energy is radiated from the antenna to the air, how good is the antenna to radiate the energy. Being the most important parameter of an antenna in mobile communications. 100% means all energy radiated, 50% means half energy radiated, the minimum recommended is 25% but in some cases can go down to 10%, but the higher the better.\nPeak Gain\nAntenna gain is the measurement of an antenna's ability to direct or concentrate radio frequency energy in a particular direction or pattern. This is typically measured in dBi (Decibels relative to an isotropic radiator). The most crucial parameter in mobile communication is antenna efficiency followed by peak gain. Efficiency measures how much energy is in the air radiating in all directions, while peak gain is only measured in a single direction. While in fixed communication the most important parameter is the peak gain, since all the energy must be concentrated in one single direction.\nThis value comes from a single point in the radiation pattern being the maximum point in the 3D sphere.\nAverage Gain\nSimilar to efficiency, the average gain is represented with a different mathematical scale (dB) and takes into consideration any mismatch losses. 100% is 0 dB which is maximum radiated energy, 50% is -3 dB which is half of the radiated energy, etc. Please see below table for the relationship between efficiency and average gain:\nEfficiency (%)\nAverage Gain (dB)\n100 %\n0.0 dB\n90 %\n-0.5 dB\n80 %\n-1.0 dB\n70 %\n-1.5 dB\n60 %\n-2.2 dB\n50 %\n-3.0 dB\n40 %\n-4.0 dB\n30 %\n-5.2 dB\n25 %\n-6.0 dB\n20 %\n-7.0 dB\n10 %\n-10.0 dB\n1 %\n-20.0 dB\nTable 2, Efficiency/ Average Gain Table\nRadiation Patterns\nThe radiation pattern of an antenna is the strength of radio waves transmitted by the antenna traveling in different directions and angles. Omnidirectional antennas offer a 360-degree doughnut-shaped radiation pattern that is uniformly distributed in all directions and are ideal for connecting devices that are on the same plane and to either side of each other. Hemispherical antennas distribute their radiation over a hemisphere (half of the space). Directional antennas radiate into one targeted direction allowing for longer transmission distances with less interference.The plot graph will show how the energy is being radiated to the air in 3 dimensional or 2 dimensional pattern. In 2D graph pattern, the horizontal and vertical planes are shown. See example in the graph below Fig.3.\nFig.3, Radiation Pattern 3D and 2D Graph\nPolarization\nPolarization is the orientation of the electric field of an electromagnetic wave. The two most common polarizations are linear and circular. Measurement and changes of polarization are determined in which the wave transmits through the environment from the transmitting to the receiving antenna. With linear polarization, the electric field vector stays in the same plane were in with circular polarization, the electric field vector is rotating with circular motion completing a full turn for each RF cycle. This rotation can be completed right-hand (RHCP) or left-hand (LHCP).\nGeneral Information / Specification\nGround Plane\n2J Antennas offers both, ground plane dependent and ground plane independent antennas. A ground plane is a surface area or metal that acts as a conductor and reflects the radio waves from other antenna components. The shape, size and the required clear area of the ground plane play an important role in determining radiation characteristics and gain.\nLow-frequency antennas such as broadcast antennas accept large conducting masses such as the earth or ocean as a sufficient ground plane. For very high frequency (VHF) and ultra-high frequency (UHF) antennas, the ground plane can be smaller and a metal disk, screen or wire is used as a ground plane. In automotive, marine and air equipment metal housing (car / airplane / boat) can serve as a sufficient ground plane.\nAs a general rule, the conduction surface must be at least a quarter of the wavelength of the radio waves in diameter and in ideal condition the bigger the ground plane the better control of the electrical performance is achieved.\nMaximum Input Power\nThe Maximum Input Power is the maximum amount of power (in Watts) that can be transmitted to one antenna port without damaging it while maintaining performance.\nCable and Connector Types\nThe correct selection of RF cable and connector types is critical to proper antenna function. The connector serves as a mechanical connection between the antenna and RF system and the cable is the transmission line for radio frequency signals connecting transmitters and receivers. The cable lengths impact signal quality and strength. Selecting a high-quality cable and connector that is compatible with the antenna will ensure optimal antenna performance. When considering a product, it is important to determine the correct connector gender, polarity and geometry as well as the cable length prior to a quote request.\n2J Antennas offers a wide range of high-quality connectors and cables as standard and also offers alternatives for any customization needs.\n2J Antennas is confident that we have the right antenna for your needs.
