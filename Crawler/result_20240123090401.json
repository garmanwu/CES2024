Though AI was mainly represented in\u00a0chatbots\u00a0in the past year, companies are now finding more innovative ways to incorporate the technology into hardware, including everything from futuristic robots to laptops to products that would have never been possible before.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWith so many AI-related announcements at CES this year, it can be difficult to distinguish between what's simple AI-washing and what's actual visionary technology. To help you understand what's most important, I've created a roundup of the AI and robots that have distinguished themselves from the rest based on factors such as helpfulness, uniqueness, and real-world applications.\nWith two press days and two event days down, I have seen a majority of what CES has to offer, including A LOT of product demos. To find out what my top picks for the best AI-infused products at CES are, keep reading. Also, most of my picks also happen to have won CES 2024 Innovation Awards, showing just how good these devices are.\n1. Motion Pillow\nThe Motion Pillow uses AI to help tackle snoring problems and give you a better night's sleep. The AI Motion System detects a user's snoring and slowly inflates airbags to lift their head and open their airway to reduce it. The accompanying app tracks sleep data, including snoring time, airbag operation time, sleep score, sleep time, and even recordings of your snoring to play back later.\nTo build on the technology, the company also introduced an accompanying Motion Ring to monitor your sleep status in real time and send data to the motion system for a more seamless experience. The combination of the ring with the pillow, known as motionsleep, earned the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.\nThe Motion Pillow alone costs $699, but it's 40% off during the CES exhibition period, retailing at $420.\n2. Bmind Smart Mirror\nThe Bmind Smart Mirror claims to be the world's first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness, according to manufacturer Baracoda. Leveraging generative AI, the mirror can provide personalized recommendations, such as light therapy sessions, guided meditation, and self-affirmations based on your mental state, to help improve your mood and manage stress.\nWhen I demoed the mirror, it asked me how my day was, and for testing purposes, I said it went terribly. Immediately, the mirror said encouraging words to me, switched the lights to a calming blue color, displayed an image of nature, and encouraged me to start a meditation session.\nThe mirror was even recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Smart Home category.\n3. Minitailz Smart Dog Collar\nIf you are a dog mom like me, you're probably always thinking of ways you could make your pet's quality of life better. Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar is a fitness tracker for your dog, and can help you better understand what they need.\nThe tracker detects a dog's GPS location to ensure your fur baby never gets lost, along with health stats such as resting heart rate and breathing. The company claims that the collars can detect early signs of heart failure before the onset of symptoms. The collar also offers AI-driven activity detection with real-time alerts that can let the pert owner know exactly what their pet is doing.\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category.\nIf you are interested, the Minitailz collar is available for $99. However, there is also a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\n4. Yarbo Multi-Purpose Intelligent Yard Robot\nTaking care of your yard can be a hassle, with the grass alone requiring cutting, fertilizing, and watering. The Yarbo multi-purpose yard robot system has a family of products designed to take care of nearly all your backyard tasks, including a snow blower, lawn mower, granular spreader, liquid spreader, and more.\nThe best part is that they all work with the same power docking station for a seamless experience. Many of the solutions are already available for purchase online, with newer models available for pre-order.\nAlso: The best robot lawn mowers\n5. Wim\nThe Wim first caught my attention because I had never seen an apparatus like it. Upon learning more, I realized that the technology was as innovative as it looked. The product is meant to assist in walking and exercising in a safe and efficient manner by providing the proper support.\nIt also includes personalized AI coaching that can help enhance your exercise experience by adjusting the intensity and timing and providing customized programs. The insights can also help with non-exercise coaching, such as improving walking performance. This could be especially helpful for people recovering from injuries or those with mobility challenges. When I tried it on, I was surprised to see how natural it felt and how unobstructed my walking was.\nThe product -- from South Korea's\u00a0WIRobotics\u00a0-- was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Accessibility & Aging Tech, Robotics category.\nSales for the product will begin in February, and I was not informed about pricing.\n6. Holobox\nThe Holobox makes hologram communication, which was typically limited to sci-fi movies, a reality. The box, which resembles a telephone booth, can display a real-life hologram of the person you are talking to, as long as they are in front of a white, well-lit background. They can communicate with you in nearly no latency, and even if you aren't in front of a white background yourself, the other call participant can still see you via monitor like a standard Zoom call instead of a hologram.\nYou can click here for a snippet of my experience, where I got to chat with the hologram of Holoconnects' CEO, Andre Smith.\nAlthough the technology seems complicated, it is a \"plug and play\" system, requiring only an outlet and the internet to function. The company also offers a desktop version, fittingly called the Holobox Mini. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\n7. Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo robot + stick vacuum\nOne of the most popular and practical robots is the robot vacuum. But a popular complaint about them is that no matter how efficient they are, they can often miss certain corners or nooks of your living space. Ecovocs addresses that issue by including a stick vacuum with its robot vacuum.\nThe charging station for the actual robot vacuum holds a concealed stick vacuum, which you can assemble to form a Matter-certified wireless stick vacuum with 8000Pa of suction. Now, if your robot misses something, getting to it yourself is easier.\nThe vacuum will be available at the end of March for $1,599.\n8. Nimble Beauty\nThe PR person delivering the demonstration called this AI-powered manicure device \"a Nespresso machine for manicures,\" and that title could not be more fitting. In the same way that a Nespresso machine can deliver barista-quality coffee to your home at the touch of a button, the Nimble Beauty device can act as an at-home nail salon. All you have to do is insert your hand and click a button, and the machine will do the rest using AI.\nI demo-ed the technology, and was the manicure perfect? No. But was it better than when I painted my right hand with my non-dominant left hand? Absolutely. The best part, in my opinion, is the convenience of not having to leave the house to get your nails done or worry about booking an appointment. Another benefit is that it has a fan that dries your nails between coats, so you don't have to worry about smudging them.\nThe device was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category.\nThe machine is available for preorder and costs $599 for the machine and $10 per nail polish capsule. Shipping begins in March.\n9. Ballie\nBallie, the circular household assistant robot, isn't new to Samsung\u00a0 -- it first launched in 2020. However, at this year's CES, Samsung showcased a revamped Ballie with new capabilities and AI features. The robot can now do everything from projecting video to managing home appliances.\nHaving watched the Samsung demo in person, I must say that I am not only impressed but would welcome the cute little basketball-looking robot into my home. Ballie was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nSamsung didn't disclose when it will be available or how much it will cost.\n10. Moonbird\nAs soon as I saw a sign that said that this device could reduce stress, I had to stop by the booth. The device, which fits in the palm of your hand comfortably, can help you reduce stress and anxiety by coaching you to breathe properly.\nThe device expands in your hands when you are supposed to breathe in and contracts when you are supposed to breathe out. This breathing exercise helps you slow down your breathing and concentrate on the act, which should, in turn, balance your autonomic nervous system. The device also has a sensor where you place your thumb to monitor certain metrics such as heart rate.\nThe device is available for purchase in four colors for $199.\n11. Anura MagicMirror\nAlthough this looks like an ordinary tabletop mirror, the Anura MagicMirror can do more than just show you your reflection. With a 30-second face scan, the mirror can gather your health data, such as heart rate and blood pressure.\nI got to demo the technology at CES, and it's as easy and intuitive to use as it sounds. The mirror was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Digital Health category.\nAlthough it seems like a fun gadget to have in your home, the PR team informed me that the intended audience is B2B such as doctors' offices or gyms.\n12. Nobi Smart Lamp\nNobi's smart lamps can ensure your older loved ones stay safe by doubling as fall detectors. The lamps use AI to detect when a person has fallen. After it detects the fall, it will notify designated emergency contacts, who can then talk to the fallen individual via the lamp, and even see the position the person is lying in.\nAt CES, the company announced the introduction into the US market, as well as the Nobi Ceiling, which is a ceiling version of its smart pendant lamp. From seeing it in person, I was amazed at how much like a regular lamp it looked.\n13. Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite\nIf you have read any of my CES roundups, you probably picked up on the fact that I love dogs. The Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is a device I am particularly excited about because it has the potential to improve the quality of dogs' lives significantly, and what could be better than that?\nThe Smart Tracker is placed on your dog's collar to track its behavior throughout the entire day. Then, based on your dog's activity levels and sleep, it lets you know the exact amount of food you should be feeding your dog for breakfast and dinner. The bowl has a button that will light up green when you have fed the proper amount or red when it's over or under, eliminating the need for measuring cups.\nI personally have met so many overweight dogs who could use losing some pounds, and this device eliminates the guesswork, helping the parents feed them the perfect amount and allowing them to get to an ideal lifestyle soon.\nAlthough it just launched at CES, the Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is available for purchase at $250, which includes the smart tracker, the hub, and the bowl.\n14. Rabbit R1\nIf you have ever wanted an AI assistant that can just do things for you without the need for lengthy and detailed prompts, the Rabbit might be the device for you. The pocket-sized Rabbit leverages AI to act as a personal assistant that can use apps for you.\nAlso: This AI startup made a $199 gadget that replaces apps with 'rabbits' - and it might just work\nEssentially, the R1 would eliminate having to scramble to find the right app on your phone, and then following through to complete the action you need. Instead, with the device, you can have some \"rabbits\" complete the task for you from start to finish simply by telling it what end-result you want done.\nThe device is $199 and is available for preorder.\nRelated\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nAI will unleash the next level of human potential. Here's how it happens - and when"

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "AI central: Gadget highlights from CES 2024\nArtificial intelligence was presented as the central innovation adopted by technology companies that appeared at the Consumer Electronics Show this week.\nLas Vegas hosted CES 2024 from Tuesday to Friday, where consumer technology companies and startups received a chance to show off some of their latest devices to journalists and retail executives alike. The event is often a mixture of updated product lines, odd inventions, and innovative developments that may change how people use their devices. But one of the central themes that tech companies focused on at CES this year was how AI was being implemented into so many devices that users could buy in the future.\nHere are the highlights of CES 2024.\nAI in Everything\nArtificial intelligence is not a new technology, but the surge of interest in ChatGPT since December 2022 has made generative AI a far more prominent product option for developers to incorporate. It also turned the term into a buzzword to play off of. The technology was embedded into a vast array of products that may eventually hit the marketplace.\nSeveral new Windows laptops will have a CoPilot button added to their keyboard this year. This will give users instant access to Microsoft\u2019s ChatGPT-powered interface in Windows 11 and is the first update to a Microsoft keyboard in 30 years.\nSamsung is also adding AI features to its 8K television models, which will use AI to upscale images displayed on the screen to ensure the visual quality fits the highest image standards available. That same AI will also adjust the TV settings based on the sorts of content being displayed. For example, it may change the resolution or lighting of the TV depending on if the user is playing a video game or watching a movie.\nVolkswagen has added ChatGPT to its line of electric vehicles, including the ID 3, ID 4, and ID 5. This will allow users to prompt the chatbot for answers and travel suggestions while the user is in motion.\n#VW + #ChatGPT = \ud83e\udd1d\ud83d\udd1c With the beginning second quarter of 2024, @volkswagen will be the first volume manufacturer to offer ChatGPT as voice control feature in many models and markets.\ud83d\udca1 This gives you many new opportunities which go far beyond today's voice control!#CES24 pic.twitter.com/w6mMxlcEdu\nRobots\nAutomatons and robots are a common sight on the CES floor, providing or supplementing the user\u2019s needs.\nOgmen Oro Dog Companion Smart Robot The smart bot pet nanny is fitted with two-way audio and a video screen so one can interact with pet dog remotely. It even allows to capture images and videos to share with friends. [ \ud83d\udcf9 Ogmen Robotics ] pic.twitter.com/PAVmiY8byh\nFor example, Oro has made a Dog Companion robot with two-way audio and a video screen so pet owners can remotely interact with their pets and even play fetch. The robot\u2019s AI processing will also slowly learn a puppy\u2019s behavior patterns and react if it needs stimulation or comfort whenever the owner is not online.\nThis was cool at #CES2024: @SamsungUS's updated #Ballie robot rolls around your home to surveil the premises, deliver messages to you, controls your smart home, and now has an integrated projector. Check out this video. #CES #CES24 @SamsungCanada #Samsung pic.twitter.com/4G5tP5ckLf\nThere is also Ballie, a personal assistant robot shaped like a ball. While the robot was unveiled in 2020, the new model has been redesigned to operate as an \u201cAlexa on wheels.\u201d The new model can control smart home devices such as lights or thermostats and display images through a built-in projector.\nOdd uses of AI\nAI is not just for traditional practices. Some companies are finding unique ways to allow the technology to enhance your everyday errands.\nFor example, there is the DeRucci Anti-Snore Smart Pillow, a pillow that will track how a user sleeps. If it detects any sounds or movements indicating snoring, it will adjust itself so the sleeper no longer snores.\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\nThere is Seer Grill\u2019s Perfecta, which will grill a user\u2019s meat vertically, and its AI processor will slowly learn how the user prefers to cook their food.\nThe company Capella claims that it has created a phone app to \u201ctranslate\u201d a baby\u2019s cries through machine learning so the parent can determine why they\u2019re crying. The app will reportedly be able to tell the user whether the child is hungry, tired, uncomfortable, or needing a diaper change.\nDC is getting the crime and disorder it voted for\nUS launches second night of airstrikes against Houthis\nKari Lake dunks on DeSantis and Haley for \u2018vanity project\u2019 campaigns...\nFood stamps: Direct payments worth up to $1,751 for January end...\nDC is getting the crime and disorder it voted for\nUS launches second night of airstrikes against Houthis\nKari Lake dunks on DeSantis and Haley for \u2018vanity project\u2019 campaigns...\nFood stamps: Direct payments worth up to $1,751 for January end..."

Here\u2019s how it works.\nAI at CES 2024: Biggest announcements so far\nChatGPT in cars and grills with AI\nAlmost every announcement, keynote, and product at CES 2024 so far has included some type of update on of artificial intelligence.\u00a0From LG\u2019s robot butler to a grill that uses AI to improve cooking time and quality, the technology of the day is everywhere.\nIn some cases, AI is just a part of a bigger product, like using vision technology in a robot vacuum to improve object avoidance.\u00a0Elsewhere it is the entire announcement, such as Samsung going \u201call in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its product range.\nPart of this is so companies can capitalize on the hype surrounding AI, which anecdotally makes it easier to get funding. The bigger part is that the technology has matured to a point where it brings significant improvements in some areas.\nWhat has been announced around AI at CES 2024\nTo better break down the hype and find the real gems I\u2019ve pulled together some of the biggest announcements in the AI space at CES 2024.\nLG unveils smart home robot\nLG kicked off its CES showcase with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a \u201cZero Labor Home.\u201d\u00a0This AI-powered butler bot can organize your smart devices and even keep an eye on your pets when you\u2019re not home.\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for potential issues, and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience.\nThanks to the inclusion of Qualcomm\u2019s Robotics RB5 Platform, LG's robot uses AI to learn your interests and behaviors and get better over time at serving as a friendly home companion.\nSamsung declares \u201cAI for all\u201d at CES\nSamsung has been pushing the AI in everything narrative since last year and its keynote at CES \u2014 dubbed \"AI for all\" \u2014 turned out to be no different. The company makes everything from smartphones to home appliances and AI will be incorporated across the full range of products.\nWe've already seen details of refrigerators with cameras and AI vision technology. This allows the device to recommend recipes based on what it can see in the fridge. The company has also unveiled televisions with AI built in that can scale content to improve resolution and enhance the depth perception of an image. And there are also robot mops and vacuums that use AI to seek out stains.\nSamsung's biggest AI announcement may be yet to come. Next week, the company hosts Galaxy Unpacked, where it's expected to introduce the new Galaxy S24 lineup of smartphones. Samsung has already made it very clear that AI will play a central role with its next flagship devices.\nNvidia expands AI dominance\nDespite a near dominance in AI hardware for the past year, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. This is likely due to increased competition from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm in chips capable of running and training models.\nThe company unveiled the GeForce RTX series of desktop graphics cards that, while specifically aimed at the gaming sector, also have a \u201cready for AI\u201d feel.\nNot to be left out, AMD also unveiled its new Hawk Line CPUs complete with AI technology.\nMost of the AI is delivered through software capable of seamlessly offloading certain tasks to the neural processing units inside the new series of chipsets.\nAI coming to a car near you\nVolkswagen was one of a number of car companies announcing wider use of artificial intelligence as part of its in-car entertainment system.\nThe German carmaker is bringing OpenAI's ChatGPT to its vehicles, integrated into its existing IDA voice assistant to give it a more natural conversation style and ability to complete more complex requests\nAlso in the vehicle space, Bosch launched a pair of new AI-powered technologies at CES. The eye-tracking technology can see whether you are looking drowsy when you are driving, ask if you need a coffee when you get home and program your coffee machine to have a drink ready when you walk through the door.\nThe other eye-tracking tech from Bosch could be used while driving to determine what you're looking at and other information about the street sign, building or object. This could even include tell you the opening times of a nearby store or restaurant.\nCooking and cleaning with AI\nOne of the hottest tickets at AI is a smart grill that can reach a staggering 1,652\u00b0 F and cook the perfect ribeye steak in 90 seconds.\nSeergrills says\u00a0that its Perfecta grill uses a powerful quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure aspects of the food and environment, including thickness and temperature. This lets you control the cook and get perfect results every time.\nTo clean up the messes made from eating all that grilled food you need a mop or vacuum. Roborock's latest device uses AI to let it detect obstacles, find complex stains and even call home when it has an issue.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

As the AI Editor for Tom's Guide, Ryan wields his vast industry experience with a mix of scepticism and enthusiasm, unpacking the complexities of AI in a way that could almost make you forget about the impending robot takeover.\nWhen not begrudgingly penning his own bio - a task so disliked he outsourced it to an AI - Ryan deepens his knowledge by studying astronomy and physics, bringing scientific rigour to his writing. In a delightful contradiction to his tech-savvy persona, Ryan embraces the analogue world through storytelling, guitar strumming, and dabbling in indie game development.

Linked to an app, it provides you with a list of choices if it isn't entirely sure which bird is feasting that day.\nBird Buddy can also provide a live video feed using the camera inside the feeder so you can watch for yourself and save clips and images of the visiting avians.\nThe base model is $239 which is steep for a bird feeder with a smart doorbell inside and you'd want the solar panel roof for an additional $299 unless you want to charge every week.\nDespite the cost our reviewer liked Bird Buddy in part due to a lack of ongoing subscription fee and high quality video.\nThe Flappie AI-powered cat flap\nA post shared by flappie (@flappiedoors)\nA photo posted by on\nFlappie is the latest smart pet technology to embrace AI vision. The device has motion sensors and AI vision technology to spot when your feline friend tries to bring small animals into the house.\nThe Swiss startup says the AI-powered cat door isn\u2019t perfect in every instance, but can correctly identify whether your pet has prey in its mouth in at least 90% of cases.\nIf the AI in Flappie detects a \"gift\" then it locks the door and won't allow the cat inside until it drops its prey. The company says the goal is to teach cats not to bring the creatures into the house.\nOne of the founders did admit that a clever cat could drop the mouse, get the door open and then pick it back up and make a run for it, but that on the whole, it should work.\nIt can also detect a microchip and ensure the cat only opens for a specific pet. It'll launch in the US later this year after an initial rollout in Europe.\nLG\u2019s home-patrolling AI robot\nAnnounced before the event, the LG \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d robot is a small device that can use AI vision technology to monitor pets and home appliances.\nIt patrols your home for any issues, fixes what it can and where it can\u2019t deal with it the cute little gadget reports the issue to its owners.\nLG claims it can also read human emotions, and monitor your home environment \u2014 with temperature, humidity and air quality on the agenda \u2014 to ensure everything is as efficient as possible.\nThe bot is also capable of recognizing your face and voice, ready to meet you at the front door when you arrive home. Part security patrol, part butler, it can also manage and control your smart appliances.\nSamsung's Ballie home robot\nSamsung's new Ballie robot is proof of its commitment to go \"all in\" on AI at CES 2024. The rolling robot has a built-in projector that can display content while it rolls.\nThe advanced AI in Ballie can greet you at the door but also come to you when you call to it. And it can project content when you ask it.\nIt has built-in front and rear cameras to detect and analyze its surroundings and can even learn recurring user patterns to automate various functions.\nAI-powered lights for gaming sessions\nSmart lighting isn't a new thing, we've had LED strips able to react to the environment or bulbs linked to Alexa for some time. This year at CES it is getting an upgrade thanks to advances in generative and vision AI.\nGovee is one of the companies involved in AI lighting, revealing its upgraded Gaming Sync Box Kit 2 and Neon Rope Light 2 at CES 2024.\nLinked to your gaming PC or console, its CogniGlow algorithm responds to what is happening in the game and adapts the lighting for a more immersive experience.\nLighting to monitor your mood\nNobi has unveiled its smart ceiling lamp that uses AI vision technology to detect and prevent falls, monitor health and even track activity patterns.\nIt is being pitched as a tool for the senior living and mobility markets and will be available in the U.S. this year.\nLepro has also announced a new suite of AI-powered home lighting products that use natural language processing to analyze voice commands and tailor the lights based on what you ask, rather than having to set the tone in an app.\nThey can also use facial recognition to analyze the emotional state of a user and change the lighting to match their mood.\nSnore tackling smart pillow\nThe Motion Pillow has been given a wireless upgrade. This is a health technology device that claims to be able to improve sleep and tackle snoring.\nThe AI-powered pillow includes a wireless device that monitors sleep sounds, detects snoring and activates airbags in the pillow to reposition the user's head.\nThe company says being able to move the head improves airflow and removes any disturbances in the nose without causing sleep interruption.\nThe Motion Pillow is normally $699, a lot for a pillow and sound box. At the moment, during CES 2024 it has been reduced to $420 on the Motion Pillow website.\nA mood-boosting smart mirror\nThe Baracoda BMind is an AI-powered smart mirror that will not only tell you that you really are the fairest of them all, but improve your mood at the same time.\nUsing natural language processing to analyze the sentiment of whoever is staring at their reflection, it can provide affirmations and visuals to boost their mood.\nBMind's AI looks through expressions, gestures and tones, adapting to what it determines to be the mood of the user. It can then provide a light therapy session or a guided meditation session to manage stress.\nIt can also help you brush your teeth with an on-screen guide, analyze your skin and monitor the temperature in the bath water. Coming out in the U.S. later this year, it will be priced somewhere up to $1000.\nSamsung fridge turned AI home hub\nSamsung has gone \u201call-in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its phones and home appliances. This includes a new AI Family Hub+ technology that is designed to bring together different appliances.\nit is initially being built into the new Bespoke 4-door flex refrigerator, unveiled at CES. This includes internal cameras and AI vision capable of identifying individual food items. It can then suggest recipes based on what you have in stock.\nAI grill that can cook a steak in minutes\nTom's Guide had the chance to see the SeerGrills Perfecta at CES 2024. This smart grill can ensure you get a perfect cook on anything and do so 10 times faster than other grills. With 360 degree cooking, it promises an even cook without the need to flip a burger or steak, according to the company.\nPerfecta uses dual vertical infrared burners to pulse and move horizontally, reaching as high as 1,652\u00b0 F. The result is a high-tech grill that can cook a 1-inch ribeye steak in as little as 90 seconds and four chicken breasts in 2 minutes and 30 seconds.\nIt uses artificial intelligence to monitor all aspects of the food, environment and cooking process. This includes the temperature and texture of the food.\nRobot vacuum phone home\nrobot vacuum maker Roborock has a new flagship vacuum and mp called the S8 MaxV Ultra that includes a voice assistant, robot arm and video calling functionality.\nLaunching at CES 2024, the S8 MaxV can be controlled without the need for another device \u2014 just speak to it and tell it what to clean.\nThe built-in camera allows for AI-powered obstacle avoidance in addition to ability to call its owner, or have the owner call in remotely.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "Digital Twins, AI Ecosystems, Flying Vehicles: CES 2024 TrendsDigital Twins, AI Ecosystems, Flying Vehicles: CES 2024 Trends\nSeveral companies with AI innovations were mentioned, including Siemens, Maum.ai, Amira Health, Abbott, HealthPlus AI and WI Robotics\nJanuary 8, 2024\nUsing light to transmit data, new digital twins, AI ecosystems, advanced robotics and flying vehicles all were highlighted at the Annual Trends to Watch opening CES presentation Sunday.\nTechnology at CES this year will be a balancing act on technology for both consumers and enterprises, said Brian Comiskey, director of thematic processing at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) who co-presented with Jessica Boothe, CTA director of research.\nSeveral companies with AI innovations at CES were mentioned, including Siemens, Maum.ai, Amira Health, Abbott, HealthPlus AI and WI Robotics.\nAnother key theme of CES is mobility, as in movement including automotive.\n\u201cWe\u2019re the largest mobility show in the world,\u201d said Comiskey.\nAt CES, mobility involves roads (Mercedes\u00a0is represented), water (Brunswick is showing new electric motors) and the air (Hyundai\u2019s Supernal\u00a0is introducing a new flying vehicle).\nSmart homes also were on the future agenda, featuring the TV as an intelligent hub, e-commerce platform and smart home center.\nAI also is moving beyond generative AI into an evolving ecosystem along with new chips and sensors.\n\u201cWhile generative AI can be tools like chat GPT, which rightfully has been the subject of intense excitement, the AI ecosystem is a much larger expanse from chips all the way to robots,\u201d said Comiskey. \u201cYou're going to see the chip makers and AI hardware companies like Intel and Qualcomm involved. They really make the brains for AI that powers a lot of innovation.\u201d\n\u201cWe're going to start seeing more of the AI in the home and CTA has been researching consumer awareness and perceptions of AI for over five years,\u201d said Boothe. \u201cOur most recent study found that close to nine in 10 U.S. adults are familiar with AI. However, there are still many gaps with U.S. consumers. While consumers are generally positive about AI, we do still see some concerns, concerns such as privacy, disinformation and job loss.\u201d\nElectric vehicles were also highlighted in the trends presentation.\n\u201cWe found that consumers are really looking at having a peace of mind when they're purchasing an electric vehicle,\u201d said Boothe. \u201cWhat this means is they're really looking to overcome that battery and driving range anxiety and have that peace of mind when they're purchasing, so a consumer can be thinking about their daily driving needs.\n\u201cConsumers are also thinking about the safety features. There's a lot of safety features in these new electric vehicles and that really makes them feel good. It makes them feel good because they're thinking about how they're going to be protecting their family. And really protecting those around them.\n\u201cNext is environmental stewardship. Knowing that a consumer won't have to buy gasoline more makes him feel like a good citizen. It makes them feel environmentally responsible. And finally cost. Thinking about a car as a major investment. The consumer wants to know that the cost will pay out for them and the longevity of the car.\u201d\nFirst published in IOT World Today.
