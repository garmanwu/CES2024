        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Why Trust Us?\nThe 2024 edition of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) \u2014 one of the biggest annual consumer tech industry events \u2014 wraps today. Virtually countless new products debuted at the show over the past four days, and they ranged from computers and TVs to various home appliances and small gadget accessories. CES has always been a venue for brands to display concepts and ultra-premium offerings. (Take, this year, the stunning and transparent LG Signature OLED T TV.) But among the outstanding design and engineering, the most noteworthy trend this year was AI making its way into more and more of our tech.\nThe products at this year\u2019s trade show proved that in the years ahead, artificial intelligence will do a lot more than just help with productivity. AI will also enable a TV to deliver pristine picture quality, tune a speaker for optimal sound, and even make sure a meal is perfectly cooked, to name just a few tasks. AI-powered tech in everyday appliances looks bound to become a norm in the years ahead as well, if you\u2019re looking to give someone or yourself the gift of an extra pair of (virtual) hands around the house.\nAs we do every year, we spent days tuning in to product briefings and combing through press releases and spec sheets to handpick the best new gadgets that debuted at CES 2024. We focused on products that will actually go on sale and have the potential to make their way into consumers\u2019 daily routines in the weeks and months ahead. (There can be a lot of vaporware at the show, after all.)\nWe broke down the most exciting products that captured our attention into the following major categories: Entertainment & Audio, Computers & Accessories, Mobile Gadgets, Home & Appliances, and Family. Since most of these products are not available for purchase just yet, be sure to come back in the months ahead to learn more about these gadgets once we\u2019ve had hands-on experience with them.\nEntertainment & Audio\nThe TCL QM8 was our favorite TV of 2023, and its 2024 sequel is even more exciting. The latest iteration of the 4K TV brings a quantum dot mini LED panel with more local dimming zones for superior contrast and a peak brightness of a whopping 5,000 nits. That translates to double the brightness of the 2023 model, ensuring the 2024 TCL QM8 will deliver striking visuals even in brightly lit spaces.\nThe 4K TV will become available to order in the months ahead. We don\u2019t know the pricing details yet, but given TCL\u2019s track record, we expect it will be super reasonable. The tech giant also unveiled a TV with a stunning 115-inch mini LED screen \u2014 the largest of its kind.\n\u2014 Stefan Vazharov, Senior Technology Editor, Reviews\nIn addition to delivering a sleek design, comfy fit, and the iconic brand's signature sound and top-tier noise cancellation, the Momentum Sport true wireless earbuds by Sennheiser pack heart rate and temperature sensors for next-level activity and wellness tracking. The sensors' readings can integrate with the user's preferred health- and fitness-tracking platforms like Apple Health, Garmin Connect, Strava, and Peloton, to name a few.\nThe sweat- and water-resistant earbuds will become available to order in April for $329.99. There will be three colors to choose from: burned olive, polar black, and metallic graphite.\n\u2014 SV\nJBL\u2019s Live 670NC and Live 770NC wireless headphones are our favorite to arrive at CES 2024. Like their excellent predecessors, the newcomers deliver a mixture of elegant design, high-quality sound with spatial audio capabilities, reliable noise cancellation, and superb battery life, all at an agreeable price. The Live 670NC cans have an on-ear fit, while the 770NC has a traditional over-ear layout.\nThe latest JBL headphones will hit the shelves in March. The Live 770NC and Live 670NC will cost $199.95 and $129.95, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Samsung Music Frame, like the legendary TV with the same, is a tech product that can effortlessly blend into any home decor via customizable covers. Equipped with Samsung Q-Symphony tech, the speaker will sync perfectly with its maker\u2019s TVs and soundbars for an immersive surround sound experience.\nDetails about the pricing and retail availability of the Samsung Music Frame have yet to be made available, but we don't expect the wait to be too long.\n\u2014 SV\nThe JBL Xtreme 4 is a sequel to one of our favorite waterproof Bluetooth speakers and an instant best-in-class contender. The gadget is capable of blasting AI-enhanced sound that\u2019s customizable via an app and up to 30 hours of audio playback between power-ups. Its replaceable battery pack sets it apart from all rivals.\nWe like that JBL manufactured the speaker using 70% recycled plastic and 100% reclaimed fabric. The Xtreme 4 will hit the shelves this June in several colors with a $379.95 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nThe EarFun Wave Pro wireless headphones are the audio maker's first and a rock-solid contender for the best budget set in the game. Like the brand's stellar wireless earbuds, the over-ear cans offer an appealing combination of sleek design, customizable sound with support for Hi-Res Audio, and strong noise cancellation. To top things off, the headphones can rather impressively deliver 80 hours of wireless playback between charges.\nSales of the EarFun Wave Pro headphones will begin this spring. The headphones will cost $79.99 \u2014 an incredible design given their design, specs, and onboard features.\n\u2014 SV\nComputers & Accessories\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo is an exciting new addition to the PC laptop realm not only for its striking dual-screen design but also for its affordable price. The notebook will start below $1,500 when it becomes available to order this spring. Combined with its versatile design and high-end specs, the price makes a serious case for choosing the new ZenBook Duo over a premium touchscreen laptop with a conventional form factor.\nHardware-wise, the ZenBook Duo features a pair of high-resolution OLED touchscreens with a high refresh rate and a cutting-edge Intel Core chip with Arc graphics. Of course, the product will be bundled with a Bluetooth keyboard with an integrated trackpad.\n\u2014 SV\nHP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 gaming laptop impressed us by delivering top-tier hardware specs \u2014 an Intel Core Ultra chip, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics, a high-performance OLED display panel, and a rich set of connectivity features \u2014 in a compact and elegant package that weighs just a feather above 3.5 pounds. That\u2019s on par with the weight of a 14-inch MacBook Pro, making the Omen Transcend 14 incredibly lightweight and portable for a high-performance PC gaming rig.\nThe versatile Omen Transcend 14 is already available to pre-order from HP with a $1,500 starting price. That\u2019s quite a bargain, especially considering its striking design and futureproof specs.\n\u2014 SV\nThe detachable keyboard on Lenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid made it our favorite Android tablet of CES 2024. Because it features a full-blown PC with an Intel chip and Windows 11 on board, it gives you two devices (a laptop and a tablet) wrapped into one \u2014 not just a feature-rich tablet with a bundled keyboard.\nRemarkably, the two components can work together or separately, depending on your needs. The product will hit the shelves in the spring with a hefty $1,999 price tag.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 4K gaming monitor by Samsung deserves your attention for being great at, well, everything \u2014 from high-performance gameplay to delivering your favorite streaming content with incredible picture quality via the tech giant\u2019s smart platform. Combined with a minimalist design, the product\u2019s 32-inch display panel with millions of individually backlit pixels and antireflective finish makes it a great upgrade option for work and play.\nSamsung also equipped the monitor with a SmartThings Hub for controlling connected home gadgets. An ultra-wide Odyssey OLED G9 monitor with a curved 49-inch screen debuted as well for those who need to replace two screens.\n\u2014 SV\nNVIDIA launched the GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs during CES. The latest-generation graphics cards pack dedicated cores for AI processing, ensuring the cutting-edge tech will take the users\u2019 experience \u2014 from heavy workloads to in-game visuals \u2014 to a whole new level. The latest components deliver a significant performance bump over their top-shelf GeForce RTX 30 series predecessors.\nPricing of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs will start at a reasonable $599 for an RTX 4070 Super version. The range-topping RTX 4080 SUPER, dubbed a \u201c4K monster\u201d by its maker, will cost $999.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Razer Aetner monitor light bar is a handy desktop accessory that will give your work and gaming sessions a bright, colorful upgrade. The attachable dual light consists of an adjustable white strip and a back-facing row of color LEDs that are customizable via the excellent Razer Chroma RGB suite. The white light will illuminate your workspace, while the colorful backlight is a must for gaming.\nWe like that the Razer Aetner is compatible with the Matter smart home standard and that its LED lights have a lifetime of 25,000 hours.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Clutch Tanto Mini Xbox controller by HyperX \u2014 the maker of our favorite budget gamepad \u2014 stands out with an incredibly compact design. Its compact footprint is tailor-made for younger gamers. I tip my hat to HyperX for creating the product, as I still remember how unwieldy the three-button Sega Genesis controller was back in the early 1990s.\nThe tiny gamepad has a standard Xbox layout and a built-in audio jack. It will launch this spring with an attractive $39.99 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nDo you have a teenage gamer that's very amenable to bribery? RCA\u2019s new gaming monitor might just do the trick to get them to agree to study. My son, the gamer of our house, watched the press release and was blown away by the \u201cdamn fast\u201d 240Hz refresh rate, the 2-millisecond input lag, 1 millisecond GtG response time, cool swiveling features, USB-C 90W charging and DisplayPort Alt-Mode, and \u201csick backlighting.\u201d\nThe whole thing is on a pivot stand and seamlessly switches between PS5, computer, Xbox, or any other platform you choose to use it for. Personally, I\u2019m hoping some English homework makes it on the monitor between bouts of GTA. RCA is new to gaming monitors, but being the grandad of the electronics industry gives them a great leg-up, and we\u2019re excited to see more innovations like this from the brand in the future.\n\u2014 Cat Bowen, Senior Editor, Reviews\nMobile Gadgets\nOtterBox launched a lineup of elegant and sustainable iPhone cases made from sustainable cactus-based leather. Dubbed Desserto, the leather-like material is stylish, great to interact with, and, crucially, eco-friendly. The accessory giant also unveiled a MagSafe wallet and an Apple Watch band from the same material.\nThe MagSafe-compatible case will become available in several colors this spring for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro family. It will cost $59.99, while the MagSafe wallet and the Apple Watch band will go for $49.99 and $39.99, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nZagg launched a version of the iconic mophie juice pack battery case for the latest iPhones during CES 2024. A synonym for iPhone backup power for well over a decade, the nifty gadget will significantly extend the charging independence of the Apple smartphone while keeping it pocket-friendly. It will be available for iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nYou'll be able to pre-order the mophie juice pack in late February for $99.99, which will come with a robust two-year warranty.\n\u2014 SV\nBelkin's Stand Pro is not just yet another sleek MagSafe iPhone stand from the well-known accessory maker. Thanks to support for Apple's DockKit standard, the motorized accessory offers 360-degree movement tracking. This means that whether users are on a video call or capturing content for social media, they will always be perfectly framed.\nThe accessory has a button for enabling and disabling tracking. Of course, it also doubles as a fast MagSafe charger. You will be able to snag one in the months ahead for $179.99.\n\u2014 SV\nHome & Appliances\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight is a noteworthy, low-key addition to the maker\u2019s excellent lineup of lighting fixtures that were showcased at CES 2024. In a manner befitting its name, the smart home product consists of light panels that are flush-mountable on a ceiling. It\u2019s easily expandable and adaptable to any space and usage scenario.\nLike all Nanoleaf products, the Skylight can glow with millions of customizable colors and shades of white. It\u2019s controllable via an app or through voice commands from your preferred virtual assistant.\n\u2014 SV\nLG\u2019s latest Styler is a home appliance that will make the chore of storing and maintaining your favorite clothes in perfect condition a breeze. Thanks to a high-tech Moving Hanger system and an available Fine Dust cycle, the Styler will remove dust particles. What\u2019s more, the product\u2019s integrated high-pressure steamer can remove wrinkles and sanitize clothes.\nOther key Styler features include a room dehumidification functionality and a ventilation system. Pricing and availability details are yet to be revealed.\n\u2014 SV\nThe eufy X10 Pro Omni robot vacuum impressed us by offering a ton of desirable features at a price point that\u2019s well below $1,000. The versatile cleaning robot can vacuum and mop floors with the help of its sophisticated navigation setup feature. Better yet, it can empty its bin, refill its water container, and even clean and dry its mopping pads by docking into its Omni station.\nAnker will begin offering the eufy X10Pro Omni in February for $799.99. That\u2019s considerably less than big-name rivals with comparable features.\n\u2014 SV\nThis Wi-Fi-equipped smart deadbolt by Philips will replace your keys or smartphone with your palm. The convenient gadget has a sophisticated palm reader, which will unlock it by scanning your hand\u2019s vein patterns. The latter are unique for everyone, guaranteeing that only authorized users can unlock it.\nUnsurprisingly, the Philips deadbolt is also compatible with virtual assistant voice commands, allowing you to control it or keep tabs on its status. The product will be available to buy in the coming months for $359.99.\n\u2014 SV\nFamily\nWith the BeamO multiscope, Withings treated us to the best health and wellness gadget of CES 2024. The device sets a new standard for wellness monitoring by merging a contactless thermometer, a digital stethoscope, an ECG, and an oximeter in a sleek package that\u2019s easy to use at home or anywhere else.\nGetting the readings will take about a minute, and users will be able to share the results with their doctor via a sleek companion app. The BeamO will become available to order this summer for $249.95.\n\u2014 SV\nMasimo\u2019s monitoring technology is used in over 10 million babies annually in hosptials worldwide, and now they\u2019re bringing their powerful tech to parents with an FDA-approved-for-prescription wearable baby monitor. Utilizing a sock/boot style device, it monitors your baby\u2019s pulse, skin temperature if your baby has rolled over, alerting parents if anything is outside normal limits. It can be used when your baby is asleep and awake for continuous monitoring if your baby requires that.The Stork Baby Wearable Monitor can also share your baby\u2019s data with their health providers. For parents of medically fragile children, this little device could help bring a lot of peace, and because it\u2019s by-prescription, insurance may cover it, though insurance plans are not yet in place.\nThe non-prescription version is sold at major retailers, and it also includes a high-resolution video camera along with all of the monitoring available in the prescription monitor, without the immediate alerts.\u2014 CB\nMaxi Cosi is one of our favorite baby brands at Best Products. They\u2019re known for their high-quality, innovative, affordable baby products, and as of CES 2024, they've entered into the electronics space. With the See Pro 360\u00ba Baby Monitor, they\u2019re taking their affordable and innovative reputation and applying it to a very pricey realm.The See Pro 360\u00ba is a combination of a handheld monitor and camera and a smartphone monitor, giving parents choices of how to view their baby. Like last year\u2019s debut, the Q-Bear, this monitor uses CryAssist technology not only to detect when your baby\u2019s crying but also to translate the sounds to determine if your baby is sleepy, hungry, wet, or just plain cranky.\nIt has everything you\u2019d expect in a modern monitor: two-way talking, temperature and humidity sensors, a high-definition camera with clear color, night vision, and a long battery life on the monitor itself. It\u2019s doing this all for just $199.\u2014 CB\nThe Owlet is not new to the wearable baby monitor game, but they\u2019ve recently stepped up their game, and they\u2019re showing it off at CES. Like Masimo, they\u2019re offering an FDA-cleared-for-prescription wearable baby monitor for parents of babies with a need for clinical monitoring outside of the clinical setting. The Owlet offers something unique from Masimo in that your child\u2019s pediatrician can set the parameters for the alerts sent to them and the parents.\nThe BabySat measures oxygen levels, heart rate, and levels of motion. Stats are easily viewable through Owlet\u2019s straightforward app. Like their original sock, it\u2019s a wireless monitoring device designed to stay put on your baby\u2019s foot all night (and day) long.\u2014 CB\nTikiSmart just finished a wildly successful crowd-funding campaign, and now they\u2019re showcasing their kid-safety system at CES. TikiSmart is a first-of-its-kind whole-home child monitoring device. It\u2019s a wearable device that tracks when your child gets near something dangerous, like if they\u2019re submerged in water or if they fall suddenly.The system includes a receiver, bracelets, and monitoring tags. You use the tags to determine danger areas, and if your child approaches it while wearing the monitoring bracelet, it alerts your phone and speaks the alert aloud over the receiver.\nYou can also buy a \u201crepeater\u201d that extends the coverage much in the same way a wifi extender extends your wifi coverage. The TikiSmart is bound to get a lot of buzz, likely both negative and positive, but for parents with family pools, a pond, or even a fire pit, the allure will likely be hard to resist.\u2014 CB\nThe Toniebox is one of the best storytelling devices, in our opinion, and they\u2019re coming out with some fantastic new characters that they\u2019re debuting at CES.Sara Llama is the Yoga Tonie, and she\u2019ll guide your child through four stories, each with a theme central to yoga, like friendship and confidence. There\u2019s Juniper, the potty training Tonie that uses stories to help your child prepare for potty training. And finally, there\u2019s Mo, the mindfulness Tonie that walks your child through mindful activities through his stories.\u2014 CB\nStefan is the senior technology editor for Best Products, where he\u2019s been covering the tech industry and testing the latest gadgets since 2015.

It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display.

The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

While it\u2019s been two years in the making, we\u2019ve officially reached a generative nexus point, conceding to admit that ChatGPT has reshaped an entire industry \u2014 the automated future is now. Pretty much everyone from Big Tech giants like Google and Microsoft, to itty-bitty startups with big Kickstarter dreams hailed their usage of generative AI at this year\u2019s show \u2014 whether or not it deserved to fit into the products themselves, however, is another matter entirely.\nYes, it feels like nearly every new announcement was boasting a \u201csmarter\u201d future with the help of artificial intelligence, from AI binoculars for the savvy birder, to an adjustable electric toothbrush that feels like putting an entire computer in your mouth. It was overwhelming at times, given 2023\u2019s show focused mostly on minor improvements to existing flagship products as opposed to bold new swing-for-the-fences technologies.\nStill, we were still surprised and delighted by some key product innovations, AI-infused and otherwise. So we dug through the digital noise, watched press conferences, and even live-streamed product demos, and found 32 gadgets deserving of our Rolling Stone \u201cBest Of CES 2024\u201d Award.\nWe chose our CES 2024 award winners based on design, functionality and innovation, focusing on unique products that help solve everyday problems, upgrade our life, or push the limits of technology. Scroll through to see the companies and products that made our Best of CES 2024 list.\nLG Signature OLED T Transparent TV\nAfter a ho-hum year of TV releases from usual titans of the small screen Samsung and Sony, the buzziest model at CES year by far proves that, sure, you can always go bigger and brighter \u2014 but transparency has never looked cooler.\nLG\u2019s new Signature OLED T isn\u2019t reinventing the wheel \u2014 transparent OLED technology has been around for years commercially. But for the first time in 2024, LG is making the see-through TV a must-have part of your home entertainment setup. We actually saw their transparent OLED concept in-person at last year\u2019s show, and while it\u2019s not clear-as-glass, this living room-ready model combines the best parts of their M4 series with \u201ccool factor\u201d of being able to turn your TV into an eye-catching piece of home decor (the transparent fish tank demo we saw was certainly better than anything the Samsung Frame can do).\nSpeaking of the M4 series, the OLED T smartly supports LG\u2019s \u201cZero Connect\u201d wireless connectivity: an external box housing all the HDMI connections and media players you need with the ability to beam 4K 120Hz video straight to the screen from up to 30 feet away. Overall, LG\u2019s OLED T is firing on all cyllinders when it comes to attention to design detail, and that\u2019s the transparent truth. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on LG for\n$TBD\nHP Omen Transcend 14 Laptop\nGaming laptops tend to have a certain kind of intense look to reflect all the ultra-high-powered software packed within \u2014 big and bulky designs, flashy RGB keyboard lighting, etc. HP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 may not look the part, but this ultraportable has stealthily become one of the best gaming laptops around.\nIt packs a lot of power into a slim design, all thanks to the Meteor Lake chip, with a processor\u2019s NPU that can handle running a streaming application like OBS while the CPU and GPU focuses on the game you\u2019re currently playing. There\u2019s an option of 16GB or 32GB of RAM, and the display is a 14-inch OLED with a 2880 x 1800 resolution and up to a 120Hz refresh rate (as with most of the laptops announced during CES this year, it also\u00a0 supports Wi-Fi 7).\nIf you love to game, but still want your laptop to pull double duty at the office or for your personal needs, HP\u2019s new Omen Transcend 14 shows that big power can come in a sleek, lightweight package.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on HP for\n$1,499.99\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4 Earbuds\nSennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 are the latest impressively-engineered wireless earbuds from one of our favorite audio companies around.\nThe earbuds might look nearly identical to their predecessors, but they feature massive upgrades to ANC, powerful enough to cancel out noisy commutes and the hum of an airplane. Transparency mode is also more natural sounding than ever before, and Sennheiser also says the buds get a respectable seven and a half hours of battery life with noise-cancelling turned off.\nBut the highlight here is a new audio chipset which gives the buds improved sound, good bass, and a crisper quality (this is thanks to Qualcomm\u2019s S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless support). There were a lot of earbuds unveiled at CES this year, but the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4s impressive technology and improved features made them stand out.\u00a0Releases: February 15.\nBuy on Sennheiser\n$299\nRabbit R1 AI\nDescribed by Time as potentially the \u201ciPhone of AI\u201d, Rabbit R1 swept CES 2024 as\u00a0the definitive AI-powered companion that feels like having a personal assistant right in your pocket \u2014 and clearly 20,000 people agreed, selling out the first batch of units in a single day, and then the second batch by Thursday.\nThe R1 is so ambitious that you can\u2019t help but believe it might just replace your smartphone someday. But what does it do exactly? Powered by a \u201cLarge Action Model,\u201d this retro-looking device is more advanced than it looks, and in the simplest terms, it\u2019s a universal controller for your apps. Similar to asking your smart home device, \u201cHey Alexa, order more paper towels\u201d, you can use the Rabbit OS to control your music, purchase groceries, send text messages, and more, all through a single interface.\nStreamlining all your apps\u2019 functionalities into one, it eliminates the need to juggle logins and interfaces \u2014 just ask for what you want and the R1 delivers.\u00a0Available for Pre-orders Now.\nBuy on Rabbit for $199\nFiiO R9 Hi-fi Media Streamer\nThe FiiO R9 is a gorgeous, high-end, do-it-all media player that will turn your desktop into the ultimate hi-fi streaming station. Like its praise-worthy predecessor, the R7, this is a streaming DAC and headphone amplifier all in one, with a variety of wireless and wired connections for any way you want to play your tunes.\nWhat we like: the R9 has a much-improved Qualcomm Bluetooth chip, even better twin DACs (now ESS Labs 9030PRO), and an amplifier that\u2019s twice as powerful. Variety is key here, and depending on how beefed up your audio system is, it can drive to most speakers or headphones, or integrate into an existing hi-fi system (there\u2019s a new HDMI ARC port, too, in case you want to hook it up to a TV).\nIt\u2019s also easy on the eyes, with a 6-inch FHD display and delightfully tactile knobs that make interacting with the R9 a dream.\u00a0Just add speakers, and the FiiO R9 will be music to your ears.\nBuy on FiiO for $1,499\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nChina-based tech startup Xreal joined the wearable AR race this year, creating smart glasses fit to give the Apple Vision Pro some stiff competition. They\u2019re taking a huge step forward with the Air 2 Ultra glasses, which represent a future with AR that feels seamlessly integrated with everyday life.\nOne thing that impressed us was how Xreal\u2019s glasses are considerably smaller and more natural-looking than other bulky mixed-reality headsets. At roughly 0.2 pounds, they\u2019re lightweight enough to feel comfortable for extended wear, and support full motion tracking (6DoF, or six degrees of freedom), so it can tell whether you\u2019re moving around in a space.\nInteracting with the various screens and menus through the glasses is a breeze, and the Air 2 Ultras as surprisingly responsive to the \u201cpinching\u201d movement meant to navigate apps (similar to the \u201cDouble Tap\u201d on the new Apple Watch Series 9).\u00a0 When viewing 2D content, it\u2019s like looking at a 154-inch display from 13 feet away. Although the success of AR glasses like these will ultimately rely on the apps that are developed for them, for now, Xreal\u2019s Air 2 Ultra shows a promising future ahead for real-world applications of AR. Your move, Apple.\u00a0Releases: March 2024.\nBuy on Xreal for $699\nSamsung Music Frame\nWhile Samsung is going full force on the aesthetic \u201cFrameification\u201d of their most popular products, one aesthetically-pleasing addition to the household that we\u2019re looking forward to is their Music Frame, a Bluetooth speaker for those who don\u2019t want their audio setup to look like an AV Club\u2019s closet.\nWhile it shares a lot, design-wise, with the Sonos x Ikea Symfonisk frame speaker collaboration from last year, there\u2019s still a lot to love here. The physical print on the front will be customizable when orders go live, so it can seamlessly blend into any style you\u2019re going for in your home, whether you use it as a picture frame, or for a modern art display.\nLet\u2019s talk specs: the Music Frame contains two, built-in woofers, two tweeters, and two midrange drivers, with waveguides that will really help create a depth of sound, especially for wider rooms. It\u2019ll also provide surround sound when paired with 2024 Samsung TVs and soundbars, or you can just operate it as a standalone wireless speaker. Samsung\u2019s Music Frame proves you don\u2019t have to sacrifice style for substance, and we can\u2019t wait to hang it up and hit play at home.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Samsung for $TBD\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 is a 2-in-1 laptop that gives you the rare one-two punch of a laptop that can double as tablet,\u00a0and one that can run both Windows and Android. More is more here, and you\u2019re getting the display of an Android tablet with the keyboard base (hybrid station) of a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU.\nSmartly-engineered with a Qualcomm processor powering the tablet and the aformentioned Intel chip in the base, the two pieces can function independently when you need them to. When connected to an external monitor, the base can serve as a standalone Windows machine. Need a more portable option? Just snap off the 14-inch 2.8K OLED display from its base and use it as a tablet.\nBeing able to switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button is a game-changer, and the Lenovo is leading the way to full Windows-Android compatability with the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5. Releases: Q4 2024.\nBuy on Lenovo for\n$1,999\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nIt\u2019s BBQ season year-round now with GE Profile\u2019s first-of-its-kind indoor smart smoker that\u2019ll let you inbue your own meats with festival-worthy flavor.\nNot only is this unique indoor smoker small enough to fit on your countertop, but it\u2019s safe to use inside, and won\u2019t fill your home smokey, alarm-triggering fumes. Break out your hickory and applewood chips, because the wood-pellet smoke is filtered through a tightly-sealed, advanced catalyst converter. With no filters to clean or replace, you\u2019ll get full-smoked flavor that\u2019ll infuse into your meats, fish,\u00a0 veggies, etc. and not your curtains or clothes.\nThere are five adjustable smoke levels, so you can tailor the\u00a0 smoke intensity to their preference. You can precisely control and monitor cooking through the smart app integrations, plus there are dozens of recipes available, too. A built-in probe also helps avoid overcooking or undercooking precious cuts of meats.\nWhile it\u2019s not necessary for every kitchen, wannable pitmasters will get a lot of mileage out of GE Profile\u2019s Smart Indoor Smoker.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on Amazon for $999.00\nMaster & Dynamic MW75 Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic has long been a go-to brand for audiophiles, but they\u2019re teaming with Neurable, an AI platform, to combine their premium sound with neurotechnology to help maximize your cognitive performance with the MW75 Neuro Headphones.\nThe Bluetooth headphones feature Neurable\u2019s unique neural sensors, meant to measure brain signals to help the wearer focus, destress, and improve their mental health (according to the brand, this is the first product outside the medical industry to use this kind of technology). Ideally, you\u2019ll be able to use the headphones in combination with the Neurable app to tack how activities impact your focus and get informed recommendations on how to optimize your day.\nMaster & Dynamic didn\u2019t skimp on the audio features, though. The MW75 Neuros get up to 32 hours of music playback when noise-cancelling is disabled (eight hours when ANC and EEG are enabled), and eight microphones filter out external noise for clear calls and noise cancellation. Their custom 40mm Beryllium drivers were also designed to produce a warmer, richer sound.\nMaster & Dynamic wants to make your listening experience smarter, not harder, and their effort paid off big time, with headphones that\u2019ll become your workday productivity and\u00a0destressing companion.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on Neurable for $649\nBelkin Stand Pro\nLivestreamers, vloggers, and smartphone filmmakers rejoice \u2014 Belkin\u2019s Stand Pro might just be the best mobile accessory of the year. While there have been iPhone stands before that used face-tracking during recording, the problem is they always needed to be paired with a third-party companion app to actually capture any footage properly.\nThe Stand Pro is a battery-powered, 360-degree swiveling iPhone mount that leverages a hidden weapon for ultra-convenient content recording \u2014 a little-used iOS 17 feature called DockKit that developer SDK intended to be used with iPhone\u2019s native camera app.\nThe device runs on battery power for up to five hours, so it\u2019s perfect for filming on the go. Bonus: when it\u2019s plugged into a battery source, you can charge your iPhone with 15W wireless charging. Bottom line? Content capturing has never been easier than with Belkin\u2019s Stand Pro.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on Belkin for $179.99\niGulu F1 Home Brewing Machine\nWhile kitchen technologies saw a major AI-assisted boom this year, from \u201cintelligent\u201d steak toasters, to two-minute, Keurig-style pod ice cream makers, that didn\u2019t stop the highlight from being iGulu\u2019s simple, effective home beer brewing tech.\nUsing the \u201celiminating as many steps as possible\u201d principle, if you can brew a cup of coffee, you can brew a pint of beer at home with the iGulu F1 Home Brewing Machine. Just add water in the top of the iGulu and scan a barcode to let the machine know which type you\u2019re making. There are packs for IPA, stout, wheat beer and ambers, and you can make about 40 liters of ale or lager. The machine will ping you when it\u2019s time to add each prepackaged ingredient, and then\u2026that\u2019s about it!\nIt just two weeks, your new brew will be ready to go, and it\u2019s then conveniently housed in a self-cooling keg so you can pour yourself up a cold one anytime you want. You don\u2019t need mad brewmaster skills to bring the pub home with you, and that\u2019s where this iGulu machine succeeds where other home brewing kits have failed.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on iGulu for $599 (Pre-order)\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Game Console\nMSI\u2019s Claw A1M is the first portable gaming console built with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra chipset, and it might just overthrow the Steam Deck for handheld gaming supremacy.\nWhat makes this chipset so special is that it uses advanced AI algorithms (of course) combined with on-chip video codec support to beef up the video quality while streaming games as well as improving performance. The 7-inch touch screen display has a 1080p full HD resolution as well as a 120Hz refresh rate. There\u2019s also a built-in fingerprint reader for added security, and support for Wi-Fi 7 and Bluetooth 5.4, which will be clutch for faster, more stable online gaming.\nThere are plenty of physical controls on the device, including trigger, macro, power, volume, and shortcut buttons. But the major selling point is the Claw A1M\u2019s battery, the largest of all the popular handheld gaming consoles, which MSI says offers two hours of backup under full load.\nThe mix of the battery and processing efficiency makes the MSI Claw A1M leagues better than what we\u2019ve seen from most other handhelds this year. Releases: Q1 2024\nBuy on MSI for $699+\nJBL Live 3 Series Earbuds\nWhile everyone was buzzing about Apple finally adding USB-C charging to the case the AirPods Pro (2nd Gen) last year, JBL latest three pairs of wireless earbuds made their charging case the real star of the show.\nThe JBL Live 3 Series earbuds all feature a case with a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen that\u2019s more streamlined than ever, with a display that lets you adjust the volume of your music, change the EQ, and even switch between noise cancellation modes. As an added bonus, the case also functions like an audio-minded smartwatch, sending you messaging push notifications from your smartphone.\nOkay, but how do the earbuds sound? Well-balanced, with up to 40 hours of playback and support for spatial audio. While they share a lot of similarities with their predecessors, the Tour Pro 2s, the improved design and fit of the buds themselves just elevated the whole package.\nAdding screens to everything isn\u2019t always a recipe for success, but JBL\u2019s impressive earbud improvements combined with a savvy, smart case makes them stand out from the crowd.\u00a0Available: Summer 2024.\nBuy on JBL for $199.95\nCasio G-Shock Rangeman GPR-H1000 Smartwatch\nWe\u2019ve all seen smartwatches and fitness trackers that claim to be durable enough to withstand any condition, but Casio\u2019s tough-as-nails G-Shock Rangeman\u00a0GPR-H1000 smartwatch goes above and beyond, and could claim the title of the most rugged watch on the planet.\nThe key here is an all-new mud, sand, water, and dust-resistant design, which looks and\u00a0feels like having a tank on your wrist (it\u2019s also shock-resistant enough to survive the nastiest bump). Despite the old-school LCD screen, this watch has several smart features up its sleeve, including the usual on-wrist notifications for texts, calls, and reminders, along with an onboard pulse oximeter to keep tabs on blood oxygen saturation levels.\nMeant for not just living in, but thriving in the great outdoors, the Rangeman GPR-H1000 also feature Casio\u2019s Triple Sensor for measuring altitude, compass bearing and temperature. if you\u2019re planning on doing some serious trekking, from hiking mountainous terrain, to off-roading in the desert, the G-Shock Rangeman GPR-H1000 is the ultimate outdoorsing companion.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on G-Shock for $500\nClicks for iPhone\nFor everyone who misses the days of clickity-clacking away at their BlackBerry-style keyboard, you can bring that same tactile experience back to your iPhone with this delightfully retro new keyboard case from Clicks.\nAnnounced just in time for this year\u2019s CES, Clicks Technology is a new company debuting with their eponymous Clicks keyboard, which is compatible with the most recent iPhones to start. Ingeniously integrated into a wraparound case, just slide your iPhone into the device (it\u2019s available with either Lightning or USB-C connectively), and start typing away. For typing at night, the keys are backlit, and it runs off the phone\u2019s own battery, so you don\u2019t have to worry about charging it separately.\nWith a dedicated keyboard, the Clicks case might make your phone too big to fit in your pocket, but it does allow for faster and more accurate typing than on a digital keypad. One less obvious feature: the case has a command button to give you shortcuts to your home screen or search bar.\nIf you\u2019re wistful for the long-gone days of physical keyboards, Clicks for iPhone is the case for you.\u00a0Available for Pre-order Now.\nBuy on Clicks for $139\nAudio Pro C20\nSwedish brand Audio Pro\u2019s new C20 Wireless Active Stereo Speaker brings classic Scandinavian minimalism to the speaker scene, and manages to pack in more versatility than what meets the eye.\nIt can do just about anything with maxmilized functionality in a sleek package, including support for streaming over Wi-Fi (AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect) and Bluetooth. It also\u00a0has a built-in moving magnet (MM) phono stage for connecting a high-end turntable without the need for a separate phone preamplifier. A dedicated line-in input can also connect your CD player or cassette deck, and or you can convert the whole speaker into a mini soundbar for your TV with its HDMI ARC input.\nThe C20 has amplifiers with a combined output of 190W, all housed in an acoustically-tuned wooden cabinet. No matter your setup, the result is the same: play music through this speaker, and you\u2019ll have a deeper, richer, more immersive experience.\u00a0Releases: February 2024.\nBuy on Audio Pro for $550\nOclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush\nTo boost your brushing technique and give you a grade-A dentist seal of approval at your next appointment, Oclean\u2019s X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush aims to help you reach all your oral health goals using AI.\nWhat makes the X Ultra stand out from the pack of other electric toothbrushes is its AI voice guide that brilliantly uses bone-conduction to provide feedback on your brushing and offer tips in real time.

When hooked up to an existing solar panel setup this bumps the output up to 16.8kW \u2014 enough to power an entire house. The best part? You can also disconnect and take it on the go on, whether you\u2019re camping off-grid in the woods, or hooking it up to your RV.\nIf sustainability is a concern here, don\u2019t worry \u2014 these are EV-grade lithium iron phosphate batteries that are designed for over 10 years of daily use, with about 3,500 discharge cycles before reaching 80% of their original capacity.\u00a0EcoFlow\u2019s Delta Pro Ultra Portable Power Station is a powerhouse on wheels, and proves they\u2019re serious about making the best energy gear out there.\u00a0On Sale Now.\nBuy on Ecoflow for\n$5,799\nKlipsch Flexus Core 200 Soundbar\nKlipsch and Onkyo\u2019s partnership might not have been on our CES Bingo cards for this year, but they joined their audio exepertise forces to produce the best-sounding soundbar we\u2019ve heard this year.\nThe new line actually has two featured soundbars, but we were most impressed by the Flexus Core 200, a 3.1.2-channel soundbar with up-firing drivers for Dolby Atmos. According to Klipsch, all of the non-passive components here \u2014 amp included \u2014 are made by Onkyo, with impeccable quality control.\nWhat does that mean here? The Flexus Core 200 delivers crisp, clear sound and lower latency to the wireless surrounds than other models. You can connect it with two subwoofers and a pair of satellite speakers for full 5.2.2 surround sound, hook it up to your TV via HDMI eARC for cinema-quality sound, or just listen to your tunes with built-in Bluetooth.\nWhile it won\u2019t blow your mind with bass, or rock the most spatial surround, the build qualty and out-of-box sound from the Onkyo-Klipsch Flexus Core 200 hits all the right notes for us.\u00a0Releases: April 2024.\nBuy on Klipsch for\n$449\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro Hairdryer\nWhile we\u2019ve sung the praises of Dyson\u2019s cult-favorite Airwrap styler before, but L\u2019Or\u00e9al has tossed their own hair into the ring with a futuristic-looking hairdryer that sets itself apart in a distinct, creative way.\nThe AirLight Pro\u2019s secret to getting you smoother, more hydrated hair is infrared light \u2014 let us explain. Typically, hairdryers rely on thermal coils to produce heated air that dries your hair, but can pretty brutal to your tresses over time, causing split ends and dullness. L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s hairdryer also takes a page from Dyson\u2019s book and uses an ergonomic circular design to maximize airflow along with a powerfiul motor to reduce the heat level.\nBut that added ring of infrared light from the AirLight Pro\u2019s hairdryer helps water droplets dry on the surface of the hair, but leaves moisture intact within the strand. L\u2019Or\u00e9al says this can help dry your hair up to 30% faster, use less power than a standard dryer, and reduce heat.\nWhile there is a connected app in the works where users can customize heat preferences, along with a set of smart attachments, sometimes a few smart tweaks to existing tech can make a world of difference, and the AirLight Pro Hairdryer is a chic haircare update that deserves a spot in your everyday routine. Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on L'Or\u00e9al for\nUnder $400\nLockly Visage Smart Lock\nThe future of facial recognition is here, and it\u2019s right at your front door with Lockly Visage, the brand\u2019s latest smart lock. While we\u2019ve seen everything from fingerprint locking to palm recognition locks this year, this is the first time facial recognition has been used in a consumer product beyond video doorbells telling you who\u2019s at your porch, and it\u2019s officially got our attention.\nAccording to Lockly, the lock uses binocular facial recognition through two 2MP-resolution IR sensors to unlock your door hands-free as you approach. The deadbolt will unlock when you are at least 2.6 feet away, and should do it in under 1.5 seconds. If that\u2019s a little too Minority Report\u00a0for you, it does also work with Apple\u2019s Home Key, and has a fingerprint reader for other home entry options.\nThe Lockly Visage can store up to 100 face profiles, so you can add friends and family to your home profile. unlock when you are within 2.6 feet and should do it in under 1.5 seconds. The lock also has a digital keypad, along with the option to add RFID key cards, fobs, and you know, a regular old key.

The S8 MaxV Ultra also allows you to control the vacuum with voice assistant from another smart device, and add a new camera that allows for (you guessed it) AI-powered obstacle avoidance and video calling.\nThe mopping system has also gotten an upgrade here too, and the S8 MaxV Ultra combines a new spinning mop with the previous vibrating mopping pad for even better scrubbing power. The mopping pad can also vibrate faster (4,000 times per minute) for a super-thorough clean, and lift up 20mm to avoid carpets. The vacuum itself has an impressive 10,000 Pa of suction power, which is nothing to sneeze at either.\nIt\u2019s a hefty pricetag, but we doubt that any robot cleaner can come close to the sheer level of hands-free deep-cleaning you\u2019ll get out of AI-powered Roborock\u2019s S8 MaxV Ultra right now.\u00a0Releases: April 2024.\nBuy on RoboRock for\n$1,800\nSegway Xafari E-Bike\nSegway is killing it in the personal transportation sphere, with a sleek e-bike called the Xafari that\u2019s bringing some exciting tech to the e-mobility table.\nThe biggest draw here is Segway\u2019s \u201cActive Scene Perception\u201d tech, which the company says can adjust the parameters of the bike in real-time based on \u201cperception of the road conditions and the user.\u201d While we haven\u2019t seen how it works in action yet, if it does as promised, it\u2019ll be a game-changer \u2014 but it\u2019s a beast of a bike either way.\nThe Xafari geared more toward riders who want to something to get to work\u00a0and go offroad on. This e-bike has full suspension, a 750W motor, and all-terrain tires, including integration with mobile health apps. You\u2019ll also be able to track metrics like mileage and speed, although if you mostly just want to cuise and pedal for fun, the bike is equipped with speakers and music playback for a truly entertaining ride.\nSegway\u2019s Xafari practically begs you to get out on the road, and we can\u2019t wait to ride it out for a spin.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on Segway for\n$TBD\nSwarovski Optik AX Visio Smart Binoculars\nFor the discerning birder, there\u2019s no better high-tech addition to the hobby than Swarovski Optik\u2019s AX Visio Smart Binoculars. These AI-supported binoculars can identify over 9,000 species of birds and other wildlife, whether you\u2019re hiking in the woods, or just sitting on your porch.\nWhile they\u2019re eye-catchers on the outside thanks to a sleek, elegant design from Marc Newson, under the optical hood, the binoculars are powered by an \u201cintegrated operating and object-recognition system\u201d and onboard neural processing unit. A built-in GPS helps the onboard processor decipher what type of species you might be looking at based on where you\u2019re located.\nWe guarantee avid wildlife watchers will want the Optik AX Visio Smart Binoculars in their personal arsenal, as they also take pictures and video with a 13MP and 1080p video camera. Once you\u2019ve snapped your pics, you can transfer them wirelessly to the Swarovski Optik Outdoor app on your phone.\u00a0Releases: February 1.\nBuy on Swarovski Optik for\n$4,799\nTP-Link Archer GE800\nNew Wi-Fi routers typically aren\u2019t the sexiest tech to come out of CES, but the TP-Link Archer GE800\u2019s functionality features meant for gamers make it stand out from the crowd. This isn\u2019t a traditional Wi-Fi router \u2014 it\u2019s a cool router.\nIt\u2019s also the company\u2019s first tri-band Wi-Fi 7 compatible router, with enough serious networking power and download speeds of up to 19 gigabits for the most serious gamers. It doesn\u2019t sacrifice ability for look, though, with immersive RGB lighting on its sides that\u2019ll give it a distinct look in any room.\nDid we mention how many ports you\u2019ll get here? Two 10 gigabit ports, four 2.5 gigabit LAN ports, and a USB 3.0 port that you can use with a flash or hard drive. One of those 2.5 gigabit ports is actually exclusively for gaming, so if you connect a gaming laptop, PC, or console to the port, your traffic will be prioritized instead of fighting for bandwidth from other devices on your home network. The TP-Link Archer GE800 delivers maximum flexibility, maxmimum power, and maxmimum style, so you can just focus on your game.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy on TP-Link for\n$TBD\nVictrola Stream Sapphire Wi-Fi Record Player\nVictrola\u2019s follow-up to its Stream Carbon turntable is a worthy premium upgrade for vinyl-lovers looking to go wireless with their audio setup. Dubbed the Stream Sapphire, it\u2019s the company\u2019s most high-end turntable to date, and has improved upon its predecesser in nearly ever way.\nFirst off, the turntable has more wireless streaming capabilities than ever, and it\u2019s compatible with Sonos, Roon and the Universal Plug and Play protocol (UPnP). This means you can connect it to an AV receiver or smart TV for a wider variety in how you can play your records.\nThe Stream Sapphire also sports some spiffy audio specs, with a chic, bespoke walnut veneer plinth, an Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge, and support for streaming lossless FLAC audio files (up to 24-bit/48kHz). Although this turntable is really meant to bring out the best cadences in your vinyl, it\u2019ll also give you ability to use Apple AirPlay or Google Chromecast for Bluetooth audio streaming.\nCombining analog audio mastery with the convenience of wireless streaming makes the Stream Sapphire sound as good as it looks.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Victrola for\n$1,499\nWeber Summit FS38X Smart Gas Grill\nGrill titan Weber brought the heat this year at CES in 2024 with their new flagship Summit FS38X Smart Grill, which has a never-before-seen grill feature you might just fall in love with.\nThis new grill comes decked out with everything from a touchscreen that displays real-time data on whatever you\u2019re grilling, to internal sensors you can use to track the temperature of the food you\u2019re cooking so you can make adjustments on the fly. But the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance here is the addition of an infrared broiler.\nThe ultimate key to creating the perfect crust on any grilled meats, the Summit FS38X Smart Grill\u2019s broiler can be raised and lowered to achieve a quick, mouth-wateringly good crust to steak, pork chops, fish, and more.\u00a0The Summit even gives suggestions on the optimal method for whatever you\u2019re cooking and hwre you should place it on the grates to get the best results.\nFor amaeuter cooks to potential grillmasters alike, Weber\u2019s Summit FS38X Smart Grill takes most of the guesswork and uncertainty out of the grilling process.\u00a0Releases: Spring 2024.\nBuy on Weber for\n$3,800\nWithings BeamO 4-in-1 Health Monitor\nNo, it\u2019s not quite the medical tricorder from\u00a0Star Trek, but the Withings BeamO 4-in-1 Health Monitor might just be a step in the right direction. Liked a supped-up thermameter, this handheld device is capable of measuring everything from body temperature to blood oxygen saturation, and that\u2019s not even the half of it.\nThe BeamO serves as a kind of\u00a0digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions, and according the company it can detect early signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more. Users can then share those results with a doctor via smartphone, and even \u201clivestream\u201d their stethoscope audio over telehealth appointments.\nWithings are currently waiting for FDA approval, but we\u2019re excited about BeamO\u2019s prospects, putting the power of an EmergiMed in the palm of your hands.\u00a0Releases: Summer 2024.\nBuy on Withings for\n$250\nXGIMI Horizon Max Projector\nThe future is bright for XGIMI\u2019s Horizon Max Projector, one of the most impressive projectors we\u2019ve ever seen. It delivers IMAX-level picture quality with time-saving setup features to make it the ultimate home cinema package.\nThe first long-throw projector to feature the IMAX Enhanced certification, the Horizon Max is their brightest model to date thanks to the use of triple MCL lasers typically found in commercial theater projectors. This means it can project a 180-inch screen with a whopping 3,100 ISO lumens of brightness, all in a super-portable package.\nBut you won\u2019t just be blinded by the light \u2014 you\u2019ll be impressed by how intelligent the Horizon Max can be too with \u201cIntelligent Screen Adaptation\u201d technology. The projector sends signals to the wall and measures the angle and the distance, accurately auto-correcting and auto-focusing within seconds. No more wasting time focus-correcting, since your picture will be sharp and bright no matter where you aim it.\nBy boosting the brightness and picture quality and eliminating unecessary setup fuss, XGIMI\u2019s small yet mighty Horizon Max is the new golden standard for \u201cpoint and play\u201d projectors.\u00a0Releases: Late 2024.\nBuy Horizon Max Projector $TBD\nMore News\nThese Small Space Heaters Help Warm Up Your Home, Office or Studio\nHow to Watch the Complete 'Sex and the City' Series Online Free\n25 Valentine's Day Gift Ideas for the Jewelry Lover in Your Life\n'60 Minutes': Everything You Need to Know About How to Stream the Acclaimed News Series Online\nLuxurious Murder: How to Watch 'Death and Other Details' Online\nThe Latest\nNorah Jones Returns With New Album 'Visions,' First Single 'Running'\nPost Malone, Reba McEntire, Andra Day Lead 2024 Super Bowl Pre-Game\nTrump Demands Total Presidential Immunity \u2014 Even for Acts That 'Cross the Line'\nRichard Simmons Disavows Pauly Shore-Starring Biopic in Rare Statement\nThe digital daily newsletter\nMost Popular\n\u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Leads Critics Choice Awards With 8 Wins, \u2018Barbie\u2019 Scores 6 \u2014 Full Winners List\nEmmy Awards: Winners List\nNew Photos Prove Patrick & Brittany Mahomes\u2019 Children Have the Same, Grumpy Facial Expression\nUnsealed Jeffrey Epstein\u00a0Documents Spark New Allegations against Collector Leslie Wexner\nYou might also like\nDana Carvey Returns to Work After Son\u2019s Death and Calls \u2018Riffing\u2019 With David Spade on Their Podcast \u2018Very Healthy\u2019; Chris Farley\u2019s Mom Wrote Him a Letter of Support\nMaison & Objet, Olympic Torch Designer Turns Focus to Pioneering\u00a0Solutions\nThe Best Treadmills Under $500, According to Personal Trainers\n2024 BAFTA Nominations: \u2018Oppenheimer\u2019 Dominates, See Full List\nFresno State Title IX Lacrosse Suit Revives Class Push on\u00a0Appeal\nFollow Us\nNewsletter Signup\nGot a Hot News Tip?\nWe want to hear it.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

Yup, that was CES 2024.\nKey Takeaways\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) never fails to deliver with its extravagant tech demos and far-out concepts that aren't going to happen anytime soon. This year was no different, with a typical tidal wave of over-the-top products, but much of what we saw at the CES 2024 show floor was exciting real tech coming into reach. Monitors were one of them, and having spent a few days reflecting on what we saw at the trade show, it's clear to me that 2024 will be an exciting year for monitors on the whole.\nWe saw many exciting monitors at CES this year, from relatively smaller and simple IPS panels to high-end OLEDs that take refresh rates to places they've never gone. The best thing about the monitors we saw at CES this year is they're all real products coming soon.\n1\n32-inch QD-OLED & WOLED 4K panels\nManufacturer\nModel\nSize (Inches)\nPanel type\nResolution\nRefresh rate\nAlienware\nAW3225QF\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nHP\nOMEN Transcend 32\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nASUS\nROG PG32UCDP\n32\nOLED\n3840X2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nASUS\nROG PG32UCDM\n32\nWOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)/ 1920x1080 (FHD)\nUp to 480Hz\nMSI\nMPG321URX\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nLG\nUltraGear 32GS95UE\n32\nWOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)/ 1920x1080 (FHD)\nUp to 480Hz\nSamsung\nOdyssey OLED G80SD\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nGigabyte\nAorus FO32U2P\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nSamsung's QD-OLED panels are seen in huge numbers\n32-inch monitors were seen in huge numbers this year at CES 2024, and they all use either Samsung's QD-OLED or LG's upcoming WOLED panels. The Alienware AW3225QF stands out from the rest on this particular list as it's the only one sporting a curved panel with a subtle 1700R curvature. The rest of the QD-OLEDs are all fairly similar, and that list includes several options from the likes of MSI, ASUS, and more.\nHP's OMEN Transcend 32 signals the company's entry into the world of OLEDs. It uses the same Samsung QD-OLED panel currently in mass production and supports Dolby Vision HDR and HyperX-tuned audio. It features a USB-C port with 140W power, but there's no word on whether it'll come with a DisplayPort 2.1. You can turn to the Gigabyte Aorus FO32U2P for DisplayPort 2.1, as it's the only model announced so far with the official DP 2.1 support, complete with full UHBR20 bandwidth. In case you're wondering, the rest of the models support DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC) to deliver 4K 240Hz output.\nThere's also the MSI MPG321URX and the Samsung Odyssey G80SD, which use the same panel technology and are completely flat. The MPG321URX features the company's OLED Care 2.0 to prevent screen burn-in, while the Samsung Odyssey G80SD's highlight is an anti-glare coating missing from other QD-OLED monitors from CES 2024. The ASUS ROG Swift PG32UCDM, which was shown at Gamescom last year, also made an appearance at the CES 2024, and it'll be sold alongside other ROG monitors as a QD-OLED option.\nLG's WOLED panel may be worth waiting for\nSome manufacturers have opted to use LG's WOLED (White OLED) panels, which are being manufactured later this year. Like Samsung's QD-OLED, this one also measures 32 inches in size and supports a 4K resolution and up to 240Hz refresh rate. The highlight of this panel is that it also offers the ability to switch the panel to a relatively lower 1080p resolution while boosting the refresh rate to a whopping 480Hz. This is thanks to a feature that LG uses, Dynamic Frequency and Resolution (DFR), which you'll see the display manufacturers pushing as dual-mode operation.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nThe ASUS ROG PG32UCDP made headlines at CES this year for this dual-mode operation, which can support 4K 240Hz and FHD 480Hz outputs. LG will have an UltraGear monitor variant of its own under the model name 32GS95UE. This particular monitor uses the WOLED panel with dual-mode support. Plus, the UltraGear model will also support things like 'Pixel Sound' technology for an improved audio experience with the speakers behind the panel.\nThe Alienware AW3225QF is already available to pick up in the U.S. market, and it'll be followed by the MSI MPG321URX in February. The rest of the QD-OLED monitors showcased last week at CES don't have an official release date yet, but they'll likely end up on the shelves during Q1 2024, as the panel is already said to be in mass production. Alienware and MSI have confirmed $1,200 price tags for their monitors, so expect the rest to be priced around the same price when they arrive later this year. There's no official word on the pricing or availability of these monitors that use LG's WOLED panels. Still, we expect them to land on the market sometime in Q3, depending on when the panels enter production.\nThe Dell Alienware AW3225QF is one of the first 32-inch QD-OLED gaming monitors to enter the market. It sports a 32-inch panel with support for up to 4K resolution and up to a 240Hz refresh rate.\n2\n27-inch OLED screens with up to 480Hz\nManufacturer\nModel\nSize (Inches)\nPanel type\nResolution\nRefresh rate\nASUS\nROG Swift PG27AQDP\n27\nWOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n480Hz\nAlienware\nAW2725DF\n27\nQD-OLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n360Hz\nSamsung\nOdyssey G60SD\n27\nQD-OLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n360Hz\nGigabyte\nAorus FO27Q3\n27\nQD-OLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n360Hz\nLG\nUltraGear 27GS95QE\n27\nWOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n240Hz\nA more sensible option for most gamers\nWe also saw a bunch of 27-inch gaming monitors, both with QD-OLED and LG's WOLED panels at CES 2024. These monitors are solid options for those who don't want to splurge on a massive 32-inch panel for gaming. 27-inch is still a decent size for gaming monitors, and it particularly shines with 1440p resolution. A bunch of these 27-inch monitors were seen at CES, but the one that stands out the most is perhaps the ROG Swift PG27AQDP monitor. This was announced as the world's first 480Hz OLED gaming monitor, and it remains the only 27-inch option out there with such a high refresh rate on offer. Some other highlights of this particular monitor include 1300 nits of peak brightness, including a USB-C port and support for Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB), essentially just a fancy marketing term for black frame insertion (BFI).\nLG has also announced the new UltraGear 27GS95QE monitor as an upgrade to its existing 27GR95QE. This updated model uses its existing WOLED panel and supports up to 1440p resolution and 240Hz refresh rate. If you'd rather have a QD-OLED panel instead, then there's also the Dell Alienware AW2725DF. This monitor ditches LG's WOLED in favor of Samsung's QD-OLED. It tops out at 360Hz but is already available in the US market.\nThe Alienware AW2725DF is an excellent gaming monitor that supports QHD resolution and up to 360Hz refresh rate. It sports a 27-inch panel that supports Adaptive FreeSync and has VESA AdaptiveSync Display certification.\nMSI MPG27QRX is also a good option if you're looking at a 27-inch QD-OLED monitor for your setup. This MSI monitor uses the same panel as the Alienware AW2725DF but comes with a USB-Type-C with 90W output and MSI's Panel Care 2.0 feature set like its 32-inch siblings. Gigabyte's Aorus FO27Q3 is also a good option to look forward to if you are in the market for a high refresh-rate gaming monitor. It remains to be seen whether it'll get the same features and specifications as its 4K sibling, though. Samsung's Odyssey G60SD stands out a bit in the 27-inch lineup due to its added matte AG coating. The G60SD is a bit thin on the feature set compared to its 32-inch QD-OLED sibling, but you still get a solid screen for gaming.\nNone of the 27-inch monitors, except the Alienware AW2725DF, have an official release date or the associated pricing information just yet. Most of them will start shipping within the next few months, but the ROG monitor with LG's WOLED will arrive later this year.\n3\nLarge format Ultrawide monitors\nNew models with existing OLED panels\nManufacturer\nModel\nSize (Inches)\nPanel type\nResolution\nRefresh rate\nCurvature\nAcer\nPredator X34\n34\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nAcer\nPredator X39\n39\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nAcer\nPredator Z57\n57\nVA with Mini LED\n7680x2160\n120Hz\n1000R\nAcer\nPredator X34 V3\n34\nVA panel\n3440x1440\n180Hz\n1500R\nLG\nUltraGear 34GS95QE\n34\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nLG\nUltraGear 39GS95QE\n39\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nLG\nUltraGear 45GS95QE\n45\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nASUS\nROG Swift PG34WCDM\n34\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nASUS\nROG Swift PG39WCDM\n39\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nGigabyte\nAorus MO34WQC2\n34\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nSamsung\nOdyssey G95SD\n49\nQD-OLED\n5120x1440\n240Hz\n1800R\nDell\nUltrasharp U4025QW\n40\nIPS LCD\n5120x1440\n120Hz\nTBA\nDell\nUltrasharp U3425WE\n34\nIPS LCD\n3440x1440\n120Hz\nTBA\nThere were no major breakthroughs in the ultrawide monitor space, as almost all new monitors announced at CES 2024 are simple upgrades to the existing options that are out there. We'll see a bunch of new ultrawide monitors over the next couple of months on the market from the likes of Acer, LG, and Samsung, but it's worth highlighting that pretty much all of them use the same WOLED or QD-OLED panels on the existing monitors.\nThey're essentially just updated models of the existing monitors out there, so you'll see Odyssey G95SD as an upgrade to the existing Odyssey G95SC, the new UltraGear 45GS95QE, and more. The added features vary based on the monitor you pick up, but they largely include things like an added USB-C port, support for features like KVM, higher brightness, and more. We also spotted a few LCD ultrawide monitors at CES, some of which use a VA panel while others have an IPS LCD. You can expect to see most of these monitors in Q1 2024,\n4\nMonitors with G-Sync Pulsar coming later this year\nNvidia announced the new G-Sync Pulsar technology alongside its Super GPUs at CES. This technology allows you to use their ultra-low motion blur (ULMB) at the same time as the G-Sync variable refresh rate for smooth visuals. We've seen manufacturers like ASUS using this particular technology with ELMB, which has already been announced for ROG Swift models. Nvidia details its technology as a superior option to the existing solution in its blog post. It has implemented an algorithm that dynamically adjusts strobing patterns to varying render rates.\nSimply put, Nvidia is claiming a technology that ensures perfect sync between Adaptive Overdrive and backlight pulse with the screen's refresh cycle. Its technology, however, requires the use of a new type of panel, meaning it won't be made available to existing G-Sync monitor users via an update. You can only expect new G-Sync Pulsar-supported monitors to arrive later in the year, and we expect to learn more about them in the coming months.\nA massive year for OLED monitors\nLooking at all the OLED monitors dazzling at CES, it's safe to say that the gaming industry is gearing up for a significant shift to OLEDs. It's truly an exciting time to be in the market for a high-end gaming monitor, as we'll continue to see new monitors roll out on the market in the coming months. Even those who may not be tempted to pick one up right now will eventually end up with one of these as the prices go down and the technology improves. In the meantime, you can continue taking advantage of the monitors in the budget space, which is also expected to see better options throughout the year.\nXDA Newsletter\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nAn evergreen writer at XDA Developers serving up reviews, buying guides, deals, and more on laptops, PC hardware, and smartphones that you care about.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design. He started producing vid...\n3 Comments\npulseimages\nWas hoping Nintendo would give more info on the upcoming Switch successor.\nbeowulfschmidt\nSeems more likely for them to hold their own event for that, especially now that E3 is history.\nlaytech\nAre those sponsored devices in that article as nothing interested me whatsoever.

        "raw_content": "The crucial camera news from CES 2024 (so far)\nThe crucial camera news from CES 2024 (so far)\nThe Consumer Electronics Tradeshow of 2024 is kicking off, and while we don't expect any huge camera announcements this year, there are plenty of other bits and bobs of interest to the photographically inclined. The show is in full swing now, with the show floor officially open. Ironically, that means the actual announcements are beginning to wrap up.\nWe're not on the ground in Vegas this year, but we are keeping close watch from afar to collect just the juicy photography-related news and round it up for you.\nHere are the most important announcements, awards and releases (so far). We'll be updating this post as announcements roll out throughout the show, which runs until Friday, January 12th.\nThis post will be updated live throughout CES 2024. Check back for the latest announcements.\nComments\n1 piece of camera news... a lens... weeeeee....\nSo, what you're saying is that there's one thing, a Panasonic Macro lens ;)\nI was lucky enough to get invited to the show last year. It really is an amazing, and overwhelming experience. You can see everything from small phone chargers to prototype $200,000 cars - and more.\nThere were some great photo products last year, with stands from Canon, Nikon, Sony, and others. The most interesting photo thing (to me) last year was a video setup from Sony where you would attach little transmitters to your feet, hands, head and go through various motions that were automatically mapped to computer generated avatars on screen.\nI'd love to have gone this year, but no invite!\nSony's Apple Vision Pro competitor #4 link is not working for me? Goes to a dpr page not found.\nOther than the Panasonic 100mm macro lens most of this stuff is just miscellaneous gadgets with little connection to photography.\nWhat we now know as photography, cameras and the like is virtually dead. In a few more years, these tools will no longer be widely used. There will be a professional high end for sports and studio photography, but nothing else will be used for. And not just because of the rise of mobile. It's because people have become averse to cameras.\nSolid state haptic buttons aren't going to have the mass to ALSO vibrate when the phone rings. I think the announcement forgot that the \"haptic\" button leverages the existing, necessary, much larger phone/watch vibration module, to replace a physical depress switch with a very precise movement. A piezo is not going to replace the larger vibration module unless it's also able to vibrate the whole phone enough so my butt knows I'm getting a call. :)\nWanna know the reason CES (pushing new camera gear) has been dead for the last few years?\nThere's millions of good quality DSLRs out there selling for rock bottom prices, with lenses for those cams going for dirt cheap prices.\nMirrorless is a huge expense that this troubled economy is not willing to take on.\nSmartphones.\nWhy not both?\nThe reason why cameras are disappearing is that people are becoming averse to using them and to the sight of them. On the street, the camera is now mobile and not only for the users but also for the subjects. They hate being approached with a camera, it makes them tense.\nI guess CES isn't for the camera industry.\nCES is like walking into Best Buy.\nMost people are look at the new laptop, TV, phone and other newer tech.\nThere is a photoraphy section at best buy, like the smart refrigeratior, haveing a present but not as big.\nPlus these product are yearly release.\nThe amount of new laptop model reviews ae very heavy this week.\nJust got a discountined 2023 laptop model with the new 2024 announcment.\nCIPA maybe more for photography.\nHaven't you noticed the consumer cameras have fallen off a cliff since, say oh, 2012?\nYeah, just use the DPR camera timeline to go back and see how many cameras that were announced in early January through the years. Used to be a lot of cameras, especially compacts, but we all know what happened to that market segment.\nLeica BLK2GO is for architect and the construction field.\nI remebered getting a lecia field image of an as-built airport you can pick dimensions from the picture since it has 3d point builtin.\nThsi nexer version is better of course.\nMatterport seem to be close in concept and much cheaper.\nWhere are the news items?\nThey're right there in the article, at least on the mobile site. Another poster below also seems to have trouble finding them, not sure why.\nPlease add new items to the _end_ of the list instead of breaking links on a dynamic article.\nGuess how I found out ...\nhttps://www.dpreview.com/news/4871236776/ces-2024-cameras-photography-news?slide=2\nWhat shall it be?\n- Canon MS500- Apple Vision Pro- Panasonic Lumix S 100mm F2.8 macro lens\nPlease! Don't break your part of the internet.\nHuh, and here I thought this was the Consumer Electronics Show! Gigadollar industrial equipment is cool and all, but what do they have to offer me?\nSometimes leading edge tech takes a while to trickle down from specialized applications to consumer items.\nWe're still receiving dividends from the USA space program for example and that was from stuff invented decades ago.\nIt used to be consumer oriented.\nThis is a little annoying. I came to read this, and as of early Monday morning (right now, as I am posting this comment) there aren't just a couple of announcements. There are NO announcements. Why even post this article before you have ANY content for it?!?\nClick the number buttons under the picture, There ARE already some news items, although none really interesting yet\nTrying to wrap me noggin around a camera capturing\nthe path of a ray of light. How is the sensor getting enough light at those shutter speeds to form a picture. Can't compute. Brain spaghetti.\nI thought a SPAD was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSignal Passed at Danger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - absolutely not a good thing if on a train \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u201a\u00e2\ufffd\u201c\nThe OG SPAD:\nhttps://static.wixstatic.com/media/8948a4_bd538bbedef64d9685aa75fb4c9af99f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_640,h_454,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/8948a4_bd538bbedef64d9685aa75fb4c9af99f~mv2.jpg\nEven better \u00f0\u0178\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0160\nEven worse perhaps, but without the same immediate danger to life of the other two, \"A special adviser (SpAd) is a temporary civil servant who advises and assists UK government ministers or ministers in the Scottish and Welsh devolved governments They differ from impartial civil servants in that they are political appointees.\nSpecial advisers are paid by the government and appointed under Section 15 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010. There are four pay bands for special advisers.\"\n\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00b1\nThose piezoelectric buttons of course do have points of internal friction or wear otherwise they wouldn't be able to move the device and offer the haptic feedback. You can't have your cake and eat it too. If you need physical response then something has to move.\nDoes an electric shock count als physical response? ;-)\nHuh, the Canon and Leica products are commercial and industrial products which are being shown at the CONSUMER Electronics Show?\nNever hurts the Brand to show off leading edge tech...\nPlus with the Canon product people already rent ultra high-speed cameras to make unusual You-Tube videos so why not this too...\nRegarding the SPAD \"photon-counting technique\", are there any applications of this for high performance film scanners? As I understand it, true drum-scanners for film use photo-multiplier tubes which can react to (I think) individual photons which is why they are considered the ultimate film scanners. So I was wondering if this SPAD technology could perform an equivalent function with a solid state solution?\nYou may also like\nLatest sample galleries\nLatest in-depth reviews\nThe Sony a9 III is the world's first full-frame mirrorless camera to feature a global electronic shutter with simultaneous readout.

The exhibit will use lights and touch panels to intuitively show how Panasonic\u2019s products and technologies are used in various places throughout the car to solve environmental issues and contribute to the realization of a comfortable cabin while promoting safety and security.\nSince Panasonic\u2019s Air-to-Water Heat Pump collects and exchanges heat from ambient air; it is an environmentally friendly heating system that can reduce CO2 emissions compared to conventional combustion-type heating equipment that uses fossil fuels.\u00a0It is also possible to remotely monitor the operating status of the system, and the Group has established a system that can respond quickly in the event of a problem. Panasonic first brought its lineup to the European market in 2008, and in May 2023, became the first Japanese manufacturer to introduce products that use the environmentally friendly natural refrigerant, R290.\nPanasonic is developing high-performance electrodes for water electrolysis systems used in green hydrogen production.\u00a0These electrodes feature a high-activity catalyst material made of nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (Ni-Fe LDH), which achieves high performance without using precious metals. Utilizing electrodes makes it possible to significantly enhance the performance of contemporary water electrolysis systems and substantially reduce the production cost of green hydrogen.\nThis is a concept exhibit for the central air conditioning system proposed by Panasonic. Compared to standard whole-house air conditioning, which pumps in air every time the interior temperature changes, a central air conditioning system constantly circulates air at the preferred temperature, ensuring uniformity throughout the structure. Ventilation technology also helps to provide a comfortable and clean air environment.\nDERMS will leverage the latest IT capabilities to manage the generation and provision of locally sourced green energy to customers at their locations. It will also help counteract the inherent instability of renewable energy output by enhancing energy storage and delivery capabilities. Panasonic\u2019s DERMS solutions will contribute to accelerating the implementation of renewable energy across society. The exhibit will also use panels and videos to introduce Panasonic\u2019s efforts to ensure the safety of DERMS through monitoring and rapid detection of cyber-attacks.\u00a0For now, Panasonic is expanding verification with electric power companies and transportation companies to accelerate verification of business scaling.\nThis renewable energy solution uses 5 kW pure hydrogen fuel cell generators, which can be connected in networks of up to 250 units depending on power demand and location. This solution combines these generators with photovoltaic generators and storage batteries for highly integrated control of power generation, adding a storage battery system to manage power supply and demand in accordance with fluctuations in power demand and renewable energy output due to weather conditions. The company plans to start PoC demonstrations at Panasonic bases in the UK, Germany in FY2025.\nThis solution is the first in the industry to support simultaneous charging and discharging of EVs and storage batteries. Integration with AiSEG2 improves self-consumption of photovoltaic power. Features automatic charging of EVs and storage batteries based on weather warnings, and industry-leading self-sustaining output during power outages, to support a near-normal lifestyle.\nPanasonic aims to respond to customer needs by integrating solar power into unconventional spaces, such as windows and walls. PSCs represent a groundbreaking advancement in solar technology, offering a distinctive advantage in terms of their applicability.\u00a0Unique material and industrial inkjet coating technology enables the creation of glass-integrated solar cells, allowing for customizable and versatile designs with high conversion efficiency.

With the potential to seamlessly incorporate solar power generation into glass structures, such as windows, walls, and facades, PSCs redefine the possibilities for renewable energy integration.\n*1: Certified by Panasonic and an independent third party\nCircular Economy\nMinimizing the use of resources, extending the life of products, and accelerating circular lifestyles with low environmental impact through systems and services that keep customers connected for a long time. Panasonic\u2019s future approach to consumer electronics manufacturing will be introduced through visual images.\nPanasonic is proceeding with initiatives to reduce the use of resin (plastic) based on the characteristics of individual products.\nWith the goal of contributing to the circular economy, this exhibit and video presentation will introduce the technologies that make refurbishing feasible. Applying manufacturing knowledge and expertise cultivated over many years, Panasonic has the technology to recycle used products and the knowledge to ensure quality through inspections and performance tests. In Japan, Panasonic are now verifying recycled products for some of its TVs and washing machines to reduce the number of products that are discarded due to defects occurring during delivery and installation, and to establish a product circulation scheme.\nPanasonic is building a system that closes the resource loop, from manufacturing to recycling to recycled resin, based on the concept of \u201cFrom Product to Product\u201d. By determining the characteristics of each recycled PP, PS, and ABS, the company has established techniques that use optimal formulations for resin parts, such as adding the group\u2019s own antioxidants and blending recycled resin with new resin materials. This enables reproduction at a level suitable for home appliances.\nResource Optimization\nPanasonic aims to reduce its global environmental impact and build a better relationship with the natural environment by optimizing the use of waste and carbon across the global organization.\nA newly developed photosynthetic microorganism transforms atmospheric CO2 into plant growth-promoting molecules that stimulate crop photosynthesis-related metabolisms and enhance yields. The photosynthesis-based CO2 transformation processes address the world's growing need for foodstuffs while taking a circular approach to carbon neutrality.\nDevelopment of moldable (pellet-like) materials made from natural fibers extracted from plant resources such as thinned wood and waste wood mixed with resin.Like conventional resins, it can be molded, colored, and processed, and is expected to find applications in a variety of products.\nReduce food waste by raising awareness of local foods and building a system that allows local residents to appreciate their \u201cgood value.\u201d In cooperation with local governments, the company will provide a food sharing service platform and subsidize the lending of kitchen waste disposal equipment to residents.\nEAT WELL\nThrough a food culture tailored to the needs and tastes of each individual, Panasonic will help people adopt a healthy lifestyle.\nAs one of the leading \u00a0microwave brands with Inverter technology, Panasonic is constantly striving to make it easier for families to eat well. Panasonic and Fresco will collaborate to deliver a revolutionary cooking assistant for Panasonic\u2019s multi-functional countertop ovens and will showcase this connected cooking experience in the booth.\nFEEL WELL\nThrough easy daily self-care, Panasonic will help keep bodies healthy.\nThe Panasonic EH-NA0J hair dryer, equipped with nanoe\u2122 MOISTURE+ and Mineral, provides moisture to the inside of the hair while mineral ions care for the cuticles, leading to a smooth finish that is resistant to damage. With continued use it can reduce friction damage from brushing, helping to achieve smooth and silky hair. This advanced technology, combined with its compact design, intelligent sensing, and various modes makes it an ideal tool for hair care.\nThe MULTISHAPE by Panasonic now delves into skincare and footcare with new attachments, offering exfoliating and cleansing brushes, in addition to a callus-removing footcare tool. Furthermore, Panasonic is also introducing new detail trimmer and hair clipper attachments. These new heads further expand the possibilities of the modular grooming system, which uses a single rechargeable base to reduce resource consumption by 60 percent. MULTISHAPE thus evolves into an all-encompassing, sustainable grooming device for diverse personal care routines.\nThe Panasonic ARC3 3-Blade Shaver, with inspiration drawn from the classic Star Wars\u2122 trilogy is packed with cutting-edge technology and a premium stormtrooper-inspired design that mimics the iconic armor of a Star Wars stormtrooper.

As the name implies, this is a monitor that you can instantly switch from 2D to 3D, allowing you to have a solid gaming display when you need it or an immersive 3D monitor when you want it. It\u2019s a 17.3-inch OLED display that folds into a 12.5-inch package, and with a weight of only 2.4 pounds, it\u2019s easy to carry with you wherever you go.\n Bolstered with a new chipset, a comfortable design, and software designed to tackle the issues with Windows on a handheld, this might be the portable gaming PC to buy this year.\n It plays both the high-resolution, cinematic side of gaming and the super-fast competitive side, allowing you to have the best experience for the game you\u2019re playing.\n",
        "score": 0.77949,
        "raw_content": "The best monitors we saw at CES 2024\nIt was all about monitors at CES 2024, and we had a chance to see a lot of them. Samsung has exciting new gaming displays, Asus is pushing refresh rates to places they\u2019ve never gone, and Acer is experimenting with some exciting glasses-free 3D tech. And that\u2019s just the products I could fit in a three-item list.\nYes, we saw some exciting monitors at CES this year. Here are the best monitors we had a chance to lay our eyes on.\nLG dual refresh rate OLED\nIt really didn\u2019t take long for refresh rates to shoot up on OLED monitors. Just last year, we saw the first crop of 240Hz OLED displays, and we already have a 480Hz OLED from LG this year. It\u2019s not 480Hz across the board, but LG is able to provide such a high refresh rate with its interesting dual refresh rate feature.\nBasically, the monitor is a 32-inch, 4K OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate in its base form. However, LG lets you toggle over to a 1080p resolution at 480Hz with a single button. It plays both the high-resolution, cinematic side of gaming and the super-fast competitive side, allowing you to have the best experience for the game you\u2019re playing.\nI suspect something like this has been possible for a while \u2014 lower resolution should mean you can achieve a higher refresh rate. LG is just making it a reality. Last year, we were singing the praises of the first 500Hz displays, regardless of how mediocre the image quality was. Now, you can get that same speed on an OLED panel, and that\u2019s something to get excited about.\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G8\nSamsung is finally being boring, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited. Instead of insane curves and crazy aspect ratios, the 2024 Odyssey OLED G8 is a flat, 32-inch gaming monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It earns its stripes with a second-gen QD-OLED panel, however, and the introduction of 4K to the world of OLED gaming monitors.\nOn top of that, it sports a brand-new design that manages to look even better than last year\u2019s model. It has the same slim silver frame, but the CoreSync bias lighting on the back is now brighter, and the stand is slightly smaller. The look elevates a gaming space, and that\u2019s more than I can say for most other gaming monitors.\nThe specs are definitely here, too. You\u2019re getting a 4K panel with a 240Hz refresh rate and, as usual, the stunning contrast of OLED. We\u2019ll have to get this display under the microscope once it\u2019s available, but it looks like an easy pick for the best gaming monitor of 2024 if it holds up. This is just the start, too. Other monitors are packing these same panels, including the new Alienware 27 QD-OLED and 32 QD-OLED.\nDell UltraSharp 120Hz displays\nGaming monitors have received all the love over the past few years, but Dell is changing that. Its new UltraSharp productivity displays are getting a big upgrade with a 120Hz refresh rate, finally bringing the smooth, premium feel of a gaming monitor to the desktop.\nThe UltraSharp 34 and UltraSharp 40 are curved 21:9 monitors, both of which use an IPS Black panel. The key feature here is the refresh rate, of course, but they come with a slew of other premium features, as well. Those include an integrated Thunderbolt hub and a built-in KVM switch.\nThe displays are pricey, with the 34-inch model coming in over $1,000, but it\u2019s still nice to see some premium options in the world of productivity monitors. For too long, productivity displays have been stuck with the same bog-standard IPS panels and 60Hz refresh rates, and these two new Dell displays are changing that.\nAsus 480Hz OLED monitor\nThis one definitely came out of left field. Asus has a 1440p OLED monitor with a native 480Hz refresh rate. No, that\u2019s not a typo. 1440p. OLED. 480Hz. I would do the cliche of asking what more you could want, but the specs really speak for themself here.\nI\u2019m shocked. LG Display and Samsung Display make the lion\u2019s share of panels for gaming monitors, so we normally know what to expect from brands like Asus at CES. Not this year. It seems Asus is the only one pushing this high of a refresh rate on an OLED monitor at 1440p, truly putting it in a class of its own.\nEven more impressive is that Asus is claiming this display can hit a peak brightness of 1,300 nits, which would certainly make it the most impressive OLED we\u2019ve ever seen. This is one we\u2019ll need to test thoroughly once it\u2019s available, but the specs alone are enough to get me excited.\nSamsung 2D/3D gaming monitor\nI\u2019ve never been on the train of glasses-free 3D monitors. They just haven\u2019t worked that well, but Samsung is changing that. The 2D/3D gaming monitor, as you might guess from the name, is more of a tech showcase than an actual monitor you can buy. But it\u2019s a tease of what Samsung is cooking up, and we\u2019ll hopefully hear more about it later this year.\nAs the name implies, this is a monitor that you can instantly switch from 2D to 3D, allowing you to have a solid gaming display when you need it or an immersive 3D monitor when you want it. It works with two cameras that track your eyes and head, providing a 3D view in any game you can throw at it. What surprised me most was that the tracking actually worked, getting around the dreaded sweet spot issue we\u2019ve seen with previous glasses-free 3D displays.\nIn addition to standard games, the monitor supports VR games and content so that you can play them without a headset. We need to see more from this monitor, but for early impressions, it was definitely among the most impressive displays I saw at CES this year.\nPredator SpatialLabs View 27\nSpeaking of glasses-free 3D, Acer has been chipping away at the tech for years with Spatial Labs. We saw this tech for the first time last year at CES, but only in laptops. Now, Acer is applying it to a 4K gaming monitor, fit with a 27-inch size and a resolution of 160Hz.\nAcer\u2019s implementation is better than Samsung\u2019s, mainly because only a select list of games is supported through Spatial Labs. The list is fairly large at 50 titles and growing, and you can still use the monitor for standard 2D titles.\nAcer may not have support for any game, or support for VR titles, but the experience is much better, and it\u2019s a real monitor that you\u2019ll be able to buy. Acer says the display will be available in the first half of this year for $2,000. Pricey, but that\u2019s the cost of cutting-edge gaming tech.\nAsus ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH\nWhat\u2019s better than an OLED monitor? A portable OLED monitor that you can fold and put into a backpack, obviously. That\u2019s what Asus is offering with its ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH. It\u2019s a 17.3-inch OLED display that folds into a 12.5-inch package, and with a weight of only 2.4 pounds, it\u2019s easy to carry with you wherever you go.\nFoldable screens still aren\u2019t perfect, but this is the best application of foldable OLED we\u2019ve seen so far. A kickstand is built into the display, allowing you to configure it for either a horizontal or vertical orientation. It\u2019s quite a hefty stand, but if you\u2019re looking for a more secure mount, Asus also includes a tripod mounting hole.\nWe don\u2019t have a ton of details on the display yet, namely its price or availability. Asus tells me it will likely be on the more expensive end, but that\u2019s expected for an OLED display you can throw in your bag.\nHP Omen Transcend 32\nHP has released plenty of gaming monitors under its Omen brand, but it\u2019s certainly not the first company you think of when it comes to premium gaming displays. That\u2019s changing with the HP Omen Transcend 32. It\u2019s a QD-OLED monitor that measures 32 inches, and it\u2019s capable of a 4K resolution at up to 240Hz.\nWe\u2019ve seen a handful of similar monitors this year at CES, but this one is shocking because it comes from HP. It definitely wins some style points, too. The white shell looks wonderful, especially contrasted against a square of RGB lights around the back of the monitor.\nElsewhere, the monitor supports 140 watts of power delivery over USB-C, which is a first in this class of gaming monitor. This is HP\u2019s first QD-OLED gaming monitor, so we\u2019ll have to test it properly before making a judgment. It\u2019s certainly a stunner from our early preview, though.\nI\u2019m sorry to say it, but I'd be lying if I said otherwise. NPUs are useless. Maybe that comes off as harsh, but it doesn\u2019t come from a place of cynicism. After testing them myself, I'm genuinely convinced that there\u2019s not a compelling use for NPUs right now.\nWhen you go to buy your next laptop, there\u2019s a good chance it will have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) inside of it, and AMD and Intel have been making a big fuss about how these NPUs will drive the future of the AI PC. I don\u2019t doubt that we\u2019ll get there eventually, but in terms of a modern use case, an NPU really isn\u2019t as effective as you might think.\nI'm worried about Nvidia's upcoming RTX 4080 Super, but probably not for the reason you think. Nvidia revealed the long-rumored GPU at CES 2024, and perhaps the most shocking news around the announcement was that Nvidia was going to drop the price. Instead of releasing at the same $1,200 list price as the original RTX 4080, the RTX 4080 Super is launching at $1,000.\nIt's a great price, and a positive step for Nvidia, which has largely been seen as the driving force behind high GPU prices over the past year. I'm worried the price might be too good, though.\nMSI is entering the handheld arena, and its debut is more significant than you might think. The MSI Claw doesn't look dissimilar from the Asus ROG Ally or even the Steam Deck OLED, but the specs underneath mark a significant departure for handheld gaming PCs.\nI had a chance to try the device at CES 2024, and it's definitely a contender. Bolstered with a new chipset, a comfortable design, and software designed to tackle the issues with Windows on a handheld, this might be the portable gaming PC to buy this year.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

It fosters excitement and innovation in the industry, giving the sharpest minds their moment to shine in the spotlight.\nCES 2024 has come and gone, and we saw the biggest trends for monitors in 2023 taking a stronghold. From display technologies like OLED to 4K displays and portable setups, the balance between form and function was duly explored.\nLG came through with its Signature OLED T, which has a transparent display, and Asus became the talk of the show with ROG Swift OLED, an absolute beast with a native refresh rate of 240 Hz. Another strong contender is the display put on by Mobile Pixels, with models that serve every possible cause.\nHere\u2019s a look into the best CES monitors.\nMP 49E95 QD-OLED Curved Gaming Monitor\nMobile Pixels 49E95 will blow your mind. This nifty tech essential is a 49-inch beast that provides you with a lot of real estate to do as you please\u2014think of the multitasking possibilities!\nIt has QD-OLED panels, completely changing the game with accurate color and definitive contrast. With its R1800 curvature, it will bring the action much closer.\nAnd when you consider the response time of 0.03ms, \u2265178\u00b0(H)/\u2265178(V)\u00b0 viewing angles, a brightness of 250 nits (HDR off) / 450 nits (HDR on, APL 10%), and a refresh rate of 240 Hz, it\u2019s a truly exciting monitor that will surely perform well for everything from gaming to streaming.\nGeminos Dual Stacked Monitor\nThis stacked monitor with two 24-inch screens is a worthy addition to anyone\u2019s tech stack because it instantly multiplies screen real estate. Each monitor has 1920 x 1080 resolution, providing crisp, clear image quality, a 60 Hz refresh rate for smooth gameplay, and adjustable brightness up to 250 nits. It also has touchscreen capabilities on the bottom display (Geminos T), which gives it 5/5 stars in our book.\nIt is designed with an advanced front-facing Full HD camera, microphone, and a pair of built-in 3W speakers, which keeps your desk clutter-free. And, thanks to its linkage system, you can easily adjust its height and angle for the best ergonomics.\nDuex Float Portable Stacked Monitor\nDuex Float is a brainchild of Mobile Pixels that provides excellent value for money with its futuristic features. The 15.6-inch 1080p display is 10-point multi-touch touchscreen-enabled with a refresh rate of 60 Hz and adjustable brightness of up to 250 nits. It is in a stacked orientation, which can reduce neck strain.\nIt weighs just 4 lbs, has two USB-C ports with pass-through charging, which allows a device to send power to other devices, and has 7W total energy consumption. This is undoubtedly a portable powerhouse, perfect for multitasking professionals.\nIt features a kickstand and supports three different modes, so it\u2019s guaranteed to keep you productive and efficient without sacrificing ergonomics.\nLG UltraGear OLED (32GS95UE)\nLG unveiled the World\u2019s First VESA Certified Dual Mode Gaming Monitor, and it\u2019s every tech geek\u2019s dream come true. This tech titan is a dual-mode OLED, which means it can switch from 4K 240 Hz to Full HD 480 Hz.\nLG has also come through with tiny bezels, 0.03ms (GtG) response time, and an incredible sound system that puts you in the center of the game. With exceptional color and contrast and no motion blur, it\u2019s sure to deliver an unparalleled experience.\nAcer Predator Z57\nAcer\u2019s Predator MiniLED Z57 is a beast. We\u2019ll start with its defining feature: a 57\u201d curved MiniLED display\u2014imagine the field of view on this one! With up to 120 Hz refresh rate and 2304 Local Dimming Zones, it improves color contrast by leaps and bounds, creating a spellbinding wraparound visual experience.\nThis incredibly immersive, cinematic masterpiece uses AMD FreeSync Premium\u2122 technology for a flicker-free gaming experience. It delivers up to 1000 nits of brightness and acoustic resonance. You can also tweak the setup to your preference with adaptable ergonomics.\nYou can get it in the second quarter of 2024 for a sweet price of $2,499.99.\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G8\nSamsung\u2019s 34\u201d Odyssey OLED G8 has a sleek, curved display with 3,440 x 1,440 resolution and 250 cd/m2 brightness. It gets a leg up with Neo Quantum Processor, the company\u2019s proprietary technology that sharpens contrast and fine-tunes brightness.\nSo, if you\u2019re in a career with graphic-intensive requirements, you should bring this bad boy home. It\u2019s equally great for gamers, thanks to its 0.03ms (GTG) response time and 175 Hz refresh rate, expanding the vision field for a competitive edge.\nIt retails for $2,299, and we recommend it to anyone who relies on exceptional clarity and smooth motion to make grown people money.\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G6\nSamsung\u2019s Odyssey G6 is a top-tier gaming monitor available in two sizes: 27 and 32 inches. It is prized for its QHD resolution with DisplayHDR600, typical brightness of 350 cd/m2, and 1ms GTG response time. It provides spectacular depth and detail, so it\u2019s an excellent choice for gamers and professionals who render graphics.\nThe cherry on the cake is that it has AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. It can synchronize the display\u2019s 240 Hz refresh rate with the frame rate of compatible graphic cards. This reduces screen tearing to deliver an unparalleled high-performance gaming experience.\nAsus ROG Swift PG27\nThe Asus ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM is a favorite with tech enthusiasts, as it is fantastic for most use cases. Its unbeatable specs display deep, inky blacks without blooming, with a heat management system that makes it virtually burn-in resistant. You can expect a smooth viewing experience with NVIDIA G-SYNC.\nSo, if you\u2019re into tear-free gaming, you know where to shop!\nMobile Pixels Trio\nMobile Pixels TRIO are power-packed 1080p full HD displays that were an absolute hit on Kickstarter, and it\u2019s easy to see why.\nThese screen extenders\u2014which come in two size options (13.3 and 14.1 inches)\u2014instantly multiply available screen space. There\u2019s zero compromise on functionality, as it has a 60 Hz refresh rate, adjustable brightness of up to 250 nits, and an aspect ratio of 16:9.\nThese monitors have a second-stage sliding mechanism that supports four modes. So, whether you\u2019re a gamer who wants to chat with their followers while streaming or a student who wants to read and compare texts simultaneously, these monitors have you covered.\nMSI MPG 491CQP QD-OLED\nMicro-Star International\u2019s MPG 491CQP QD-OLED was a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree for a reason. It features a Dual Quad High Definition (DQHD) resolution in a curved next-gen QD-OLED panel. That\u2019s 7,372,800 pixels per frame to deliver the most vivid, detail-rich viewing experience ever.\nThis monitor also has a 144Hz refresh rate and a rapid 0.03ms (GtG) response time, promising exceptionally smooth and responsive gameplay and reduced motion blur, effectively putting you ahead of the competition.\nPlus, it is equipped with Graphene film for silent and efficient heat dissipation.\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor has raised the standard with 4K resolution in OLED.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: Everything you need to know about the camera and tech showcase\nThe world's biggest technology show, CES 2024 is taking place in Las Vegas next week.\u00a0What camera kit will be there?\nCES 2024, the biggest technology event in the world, is taking place next week \u2013\u00a0and it's going to be the site of some huge announcements in the world of electronics.\nAs always (at least, when there's not a pandemic), CES 2024 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada and runs from January 09-12. Last year saw 117,000 visitors and 3,200 exhibitors at the event, including the biggest technology giants such as Google and Microsoft.\nOf specific interest to us, of course, are the imaging giants who are participating at this year's show: Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Adobe. While CES 2024 is a general technology showcase, not one dedicated to photography or videography in specific, it has been used as a launchpad for cameras and imaging tech. And with both video and AI being cornerstones of this year's event, we're sure to see some exciting launches.\nFull details on the show can be found at the CES website.\u00a0For now, here's what we're excited about and what we expect to see\u2026\nWhen is CES 2024?\nCES 2023 will take place in its traditional home of Las Vegas, Nevada, running from Tuesday January 09 to Friday January 12.\nThe event emanates from the Las Vegas Convention Center. If you're in the area, attendance details are on the CES website.\nWhat do we expect at CES 2024?\nSony\nWord has it that Sony could announce five cameras this year, among them the Sony A1 II, A7S IV, FX3 II and ZV-E10 II. With all of these featuring headline video capabilities, it would certainly be the right time and place to debut at the video-obsessed CES.\nPersonally I think it's waaaaaay too early for a Sony A1 successor, though with a new rumor that the company could replace the Sony A7S III (and the A7S line altogether) and the Sony FX3 with the FX3 II, this feels like a new pillar that would be well-cemented in Las Vegas.\nPanasonic\nThere's been plenty of chatter about replacements for the Panasonic S1 / S1R, Panasonic S1H and Panasonic GH6. And given that the company launched the Panasonic S5X and S5 IIX last January, it's entirely possible that an S1R II, S1H II and GH7 could be revealed at CES 2024.\nOf course, as a general tech giant, we could see plenty of other adjacent imaging breakthroughs. At last year's show Panasonic announced \"life changing\" smart glasses, made in conjunction with Biel Glasses, using AI to help users with impaired vision.\nHeck, maybe we might finally see Panasonic announce something 8K-related\u2026\nCanon\nWill CES 2024 be the launchpad for the highly anticipated Canon EOS R1? We all know that the new flagship is on the way, and that it's intended to launch in time for the Paris Olympics, so time is running out for Canon to show it to the world.\nThere are plenty of other possibilities, too. The Canon EOS R5 II feels a little ambitious, but Canon has a habit of showcasing its latest collection of concept cameras \u2013\u00a0many of which have made it to market, such as the Canon PowerShot Zoom and Canon PowerShot Pick. These are always fascinating glimpses into the future, and I'm excited to see what's on show this year!\nNikon\nAfter a knockout year in 2023, Nikon could capitalize by taking the bull by the horns early in 2024. The likeliest candidate to me would be the Nikon Z6 III, which is widely expected to be here any minute.\nThere has also been a wild rumor about a Nikon Z9H \u2013\u00a0a speed-oriented version of the Nikon Z9. The \"H\" is ostensibly a nod to the suffix Nikon used to give to its flagship cameras to denote particular performance specialisms \u2013\u00a0such as the Nikon D1H, which was a speed-oriented upgrade of the base D1.\u00a0Personally I'll believe this one when I see it!\nFujifilm\nThis feels like a bit of a long shot, as Fujifilm is usually more at home announcing products on its home turf at CP+. That said, with reports that the manufacturer will launch more cameras in January alone than it did in 2023 as a whole, a launch or announcement isn't out of the question.\nWhat could this be? Well, a follow-up to the Fujifilm X100V is widely expected \u2013 and given what a blockbuster success that camera was, it could be a good fit for the broader-appeal of CES 2024. An outside chance would be the Instax Mini 99, which sounds like it might be a disruptive product.\nCES 2024 announcements\nLaCie Rugged Mini SSD\nThe palm-sized LaCie Rugged Mini SSD has been announced in capacities up to 4TB offering IP54 dust and rain resistance, 3-meter drop protection and 1-ton car pressure resistance.\u00a0No need to baby your portable SSD any more!\nLaCie claims write speeds of up to 2000MB/s, with USB 3.2 gen 2x2 and compatibility with USB 40Gbps, USB 10Gps, Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts including the latest Apple iPad, iPhone and Macbooks. Prices start at $79.99 for 500GB and go up to $349.99 for 4TB.\nFull story: LaCie adds to its famous Rugged lineup with a new palm-sized SSD\nWith a good few days to go until the event kicks off, there will be plenty more news, announcements and leaks between now and doors opening. Stay tuned to this page where we'll keep you updated with all the launches as they happen!\nWe're expecting to see some of the best cameras for video and maybe even the best cameras for vlogging announced at the show, along with AI improvements to the best photo editing software and the best video editing software.\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\nGet the Digital Camera World Newsletter\nThe best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!\nThe editor of Digital Camera World, James has 21 years experience as a journalist and started working in the photographic industry in 2014 (as an assistant to Damian McGillicuddy, who succeeded David Bailey as Principal Photographer for Olympus).
