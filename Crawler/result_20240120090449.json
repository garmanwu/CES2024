        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Hong Kong start-ups attract interest from Microsoft, Best Buy amid overseas push\nLast Tuesday, the first day of the trade show in Las Vegas, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella swung by the Tech Hong Kong pavilion to chat with AI Guided, a company that makes a belt with haptic feedback for obstacle detection, helping to guide the blind.\n\u201cMicrosoft really supports accessibility technology,\u201d said Steve Kong, co-founder and chief technology officer of AI Guided. \u201cThe dream of our company is that in three to five years \u2026 visually impaired people can have some hands-free experience to navigate the world.\u201d\nAI Guided is one of 20 Hong Kong-based companies exhibiting with the city\u2019s start-up pavilion this year, a big improvement over the eight that exhibited last year because of the last-minute lifting of Covid-19 restrictions.\nEven leading up to the show, Hong Kong Science and Technology Park (HKSTP) said 40 companies applied to exhibit in the Eureka Park start-up area, a marked improvement over previous years, according to H L Yiu, corporate development officer for HKSTP, which runs the pavilion.\nRealme unveils 12 Pro series smartphone in parallel event to CES\n\u201cWe had to make some selection of companies that have more of a mature level of readiness in terms of being ready to sell,\u201d Yiu said in an interview. \u201cWe really mean to help them get new business.\u201d\nWith limited space, HKSTP focused on picking companies that were closer to having products ready to go, or even already in the market, with the goal of picking up business deals at CES.\nFor some, that could pan out in a big way.\nInvisible & Innovation Technology, aka Invisible Tech, which builds speakers into furniture, said it has received interest from Best Buy. A representative from the largest electronics retail chain in the US told Invisible Tech that it had not seen other products like its cabinet with an embedded speaker in the base, according to the start-up\u2019s co-founder Patrick Lee.\n\u201cBest Buy always wants to source something new,\u201d said Lee. \u201cFurniture is a very traditional thing that [has not had] much disruptive design or link with technology.\u201d\nInvisible Tech also uses recycled materials in some parts of its products. Henry Cheung, the company\u2019s other co-founder, said the company wants to \u201chelp Hong Kong fulfil its carbon neutral mission\u201d. The city aims to be carbon neutral by 2050.\nThe Hong Kong pavilion at this year\u2019s CES, which concluded on Friday, featured a variety of start-ups that make products ranging from the quirky to the practical.\nChinese EV maker shows off flying car but admits urban use is far off\nXOXO Beverages already has its cocktail-making machine in about 10 bars and restaurants in Hong Kong, but it has not expanded to home use yet. Co-founder Peter Yau said CES was the best show the company has been to.\n\u201cPeople from all around the world come by and are very interested in the product,\u201d Yau said. \u201c[We got] a lot of contacts, and we\u2019re looking to see what we can do after [the show] with those guys.\u201d\nTwo of the participating companies, Sitan Semiconductor International and Raysolve Technology, make micro-LED displays, something that has become more important amid rising interest in augmented reality glasses.\nFor most of the start-ups, though, CES was about getting leads and looking for ways to expand beyond their home market. Getting the attention of a tech giant like Microsoft is one way to achieve that.\nAsked about the prospects of Microsoft investing, AI Guided\u2019s Kong said, \u201cI hope so \u2026 I will still have another discussion with them, so we\u2019ll see.\u201d\nThis kind of attention also may help the Hong Kong government justify its efforts to turn the city into a tech hub, which has had mixed results in a city better known as a regional financial hub.\n\u201cFrom a tech area standpoint, I think the opportunity to come to Hong Kong is surging,\u201d said HKSTP\u2019s Yiu. \u201cThe number of start-ups that we nurture every year is an increasing trend.\u201d"

HKSTP has created a thriving I&T ecosystem supporting over 10 unicorns with more than 13,000 research professionals and around 1,600 technology companies from 24 countries and regions focused on healthtech, AI and robotics, fintech and smart city technologies.\nWe offer comprehensive support to attract and nurture talent, accelerate and commercialise innovation for technology ventures on their I&T journey. Our growing innovation ecosystem is built around our key locations of Hong Kong Science Park in Shatin, InnoCentre in Kowloon Tong and three modern InnoParks in Tai Po, Tseung Kwan O and Yuen Long. The three InnoParks are realising a vision of new industrialisation for Hong Kong, where sectors including advanced manufacturing, micro-electronics and biotechnology are being reimagined for a new generation of industry.\nTo support Hong Kong's future development and its growing demands of the I&T industry, HKSTP is actively connecting the city with Shenzhen. This aims to strengthen cross-border exchange, attract technology companies as well as talent from around the world, helping them go global by exploring the mainland China and overseas markets.\nHong Kong Science Park Shenzhen Branch in Futian, Shenzhen, opened in September this year with a gross floor area of 31,000 square meters. The two buildings provide both dry and wet laboratories, co-working areas, conference and exhibition spaces, and more. We will focus on attracting enterprises in seven key areas: Medtech, big data and AI, robotics, new materials, microelectronics, fintech and sustainability.\nThrough our infrastructure, services, expertise, and network of partnerships, HKSTP will help establish I&T as a pillar of growth for Hong Kong, while reinforcing the city's international I&T hub status as a launchpad for growth at the heart of the GBA innovation powerhouse.\nMore information about HKSTP is available at www.hkstp.org.\nClick here for more details about our booth at: https://ces24.mapyourshow.com/8_0/exhibitor/exhibitor-details.cfm?exhid=0013000001KaMKhAAN\nSOURCE\nHong Kong Tech\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Cision Ltd.\nGeneral Terms & Conditions\u00a0|\u00a0Privacy Policy\nCookie Policy"
