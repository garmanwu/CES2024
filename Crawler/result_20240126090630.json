Here\u2019s how it works.\n7 best audio products at CES 2024\nMy pick of the top audio highlights to look out for in the year ahead\nCES 2024 may be wrapping up, but this year's event has been an amazing insight into what to expect in the world of consumer tech for the year ahead. The five-day monster Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas allows tech industry visitors to gaze into future development plans from all kinds of tech companies ahead of the official product releases.\nSo far this year we've seen some remarkable tech developments. From massive strides in the world of display technology to artificial intelligence and the robotic invasion that's expected to take over our homes, gardens and workspaces over the next 12 months. More excitingly for me as audio editor though, is the riot of new audio products on the horizon, from the mind-blowing $750,000 (no, that's not a typo) Sonus faber Suprema speaker system, to the latest products helping to streamline our audio setups and deliver the highest quality listening experiences.\nHere's a rundown of my favorite audio picks announced at CES 2024 set to energize our ears with great sound in the year ahead.\nLuxury speaker system\nSonus faber Suprema\nPriced at\u00a0$750,000 / \u00a3695,000 / AU$1,119,980 for the full loudspeaker system, these are without exception the most expensive speaker system I've ever seen. Announced by luxury Italian loudspeaker specialist Sonus faber at CES 2024, they're easily one of the most expensive products at the Las Vegas event, and the new Suprema embodies the height of luxury and the ultimate experience for audio and design enthusiasts.\nTom's Guide readers will already know of the sumptuous $1,999 Omnia wireless speaker system, one of the best one-box music systems available. But by some margin, this is the high-end speaker company's most ambitious project ever.\nBuilt to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, the Suprema demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship.\nThe lavish Suprema speaker system is built to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, and demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship using luxurious materials including carbon fiber,\u00a0wood,\u00a0solid aluminum, and genuine Italian leather.\nThe Suprema system features 2 main lute-shaped columns weighing in at 242.5 pounds each (around 110kg) configured as a 4/5-way system\u00a0with\u00a08 front-firing speakers plus 2 back-firing drivers. The full Suprema system's matching elliptical subwoofers weigh 227 pounds (around 103kg) each. They are fitted with 2 powerful 15-inch (38cm) transducers\u00a0featuring forged carbon fiber membranes and\u00a0a neodymium magnet motor system\u00a0to ensure it delivers powerful bass notes down to 16Hz.\nLastly, the dual mono and fully balanced electronic crossover manages the integration between the Suprema main columns and subwoofers and offers\u00a0versatility while maintaining the maximum integrity of the audio signal.\nIf you have pockets (or a bank vault) deep enough, the remarkable Suprema speaker system is produced on request and available to order from the Sonus faber website.\nBest desktop audio solution\nFiiO R9\nAlthough FiiO launched several new products at CES 2024, the most eye-catching is the flagship R9 desktop streamer and headphone amp/DAC. Aimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices, including wired and wireless headphones, active speakers, smartphones and PCs.\nIt supports 6.35mm and balanced 4.4mm wired headphones connections and there's a balanced 4-pin XLR output. With a power output of up to 7300mW, FiiO says that the R9 is capable of driving both low-and high-impedance headphones.\nAround the back, there's an HDMI ARC port, SD and USB ports, plus optical, coaxial, and ethernet inputs, with the FiiO R9 also supports 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and has Bluetooth 5.0 on board with support for high-quality codec including aptX HD and LDAC.\nAimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices.\nWith 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DACs, the FiiO R9 is equipped to handle full hi-res PCM audio files up to 32-bit/768kHz, native DSD512, and features MQA decoding. The 64GB of onboard storage is expandable to 2TB via SD card, meaning your personal collection of audio files can be played back using the FiiO Music app. Streaming applications for all the best music streaming services (and more) can be downloaded and installed via either the Google Play Store or FiiO Store apps to deliver audio in its native quality.\nThe Full-HD 6-inch color touchscreen display on front is designed to provide easy system navigation, and the R9 comes supplied with a Bluetooth remote control too.\nThe FiiO R9 will be available from mid-January, priced at $1,499 / \u00a31,399 (around AU$2,239). For more information head to the FiiO website.\nBest soundbar audio partnership\nKlipsch Flexus series\nSpeaker specialist Klipsch and AV amp maker Onkyo unveiled a surprising partnership at CES 2024 with Klipsch's new Flexus series of soundbars, subwoofers and satellite speakers. The new lineup includes the Flexus Core 100 ($299) and 200 ($499) soundbars as well as the Sub 100 subwoofer and Surr 100 surrounds.\nOnkyo is probably most frequently associated with some of the best AV receivers that use power amplifiers and surround-sound decoders, both of which are crucial for soundbars.\u00a0According to a Klipsch representative, \"all of the non-passive components\" \u2014 amp included \u2014 are made by Onkyo, which bodes well for integrated speakers systems and quality control thanks to the company's technical know-how.\nThe Flexus series of products are due out by April with further innovations to the lineup coming sometime in the future. Read the full Klipsch Flexus story on their debut at\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0and what we made of the new series during a private listening demo.\nBest home cinema speaker series\nFocal Aria Evo X series\nPriced a little less lofty than Sonus faber's made-to-order Suprema loudspeaker system (top), French audio specialist, Focal, unveiled new iterations of its Aria series speakers earlier this week at CES 2024. They're still high-end though compared to majority of the best Bluetooth speakers we cover at Tom's Guide, and the updated series builds on the original Aria 900 passive loudspeaker series launched in 2013.\nThe new Focal Aria Evo X collection consists of five speakers designed for both music and home cinema, making them ideal options for the best AV receivers, although there's no mention of Dolby Atmos height speakers. The new series of speaker models includes the Aria Evo X N\u00b01 ($2,398 / \u00a31,299) compact bookshelf speaker, Aria Evo X N\u00b02 ($4,798 / \u00a32,999), N\u00b03 ($5,198 / \u00a33,499 ), N\u00b04 ($5,998 / \u00a33,999) floorstanding speakers, and Aria Evo X ($999\u00a0/ \u00a3699) center speaker.\nAs you'd expect from any new loudspeaker series, the next-gen Evo X incorporates sonic improvements said to upgrade performance including a woofer redesign for more powerful lows. The new line\u2019s midrange and bass speaker drivers are all made from Focal\u2019s iconic flax cone said to achieve a natural sound and a rich, immersive listening experience, and includes that \u2018M\u2019-shaped inverted dome tweeter for extended high frequency performance.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X speaker range is available already in black high gloss, walnut and moss green high gloss finishes. More information can be found at the Focal website and via specialist dealers.\nBest wireless streaming turntable\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe new Victrola Stream Sapphire record player comes with a modern day tech twist that offers better-than-Bluetooth wireless integration with high-quality vinyl playback to wirelessly connected speakers and devices over Wi-Fi. It looks like an ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience, as well as possibly enticing a few vinyl fans to return to the format, too.\nBuilding on the DNA of its flagship\u00a0Stream Carbon\u00a0turntable, the Victrola Stream Sapphire includes multiple wireless connectivity options (as well as wired Ethernet connectivity) \u2014 all controlled via the Victrola app. There's the ability to stream vinyl to a Sonos speaker or multiple Sonos speakers simultaneously around the home. You can also opt to stream to UPnP networked devices such as\u00a0KEF's LSX II Wireless\u00a0Hi-Fi speakers (pictured) and Roon systems (a music management solution that integrates networked storage devices and music streaming service to connect via AirPlay, Chromecast, and Roon Ready connectivity) with support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nAn ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience.\nDespite offering comprehensive wireless connectivity, there are also RCA outputs at the back that allow you to connect the Victrola to wired systems or powered speakers. The Stream Sapphire turntable has a traditional MDF plinth with walnut veneer and is fitted with adjustable-height aluminum feet with vibration isolation. There's an upgraded motor design, too, that powers the belt-driven record platter. A carbon-fiber tonearm with removable head shell and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge (worth $240) complete this turntable's audiophile credentials.\nVictrola says that the Stream Sapphire is for the vinyl lover seeking more options for high-quality wireless audio fused with beautiful design and premium components. It's expected to sell for $1,499 (around \u00a31,180 / AU$2,800) when it goes on sale in spring 2024 at\u00a0Victrola.com.\nBest wireless earbuds with audiophile sound\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nSennheiser unveiled three new products at CES 2024, but the most interesting to audiophiles like myself is the Momentum True Wireless 4. The new premium earbuds will bring the popular series bang up to date for 2024 with stacks of new features and audio enhancements incorporated into a slightly smaller design. Sennheiser bills the new version as its most capable earbuds yet, and from what I've seen, they could easily be set to rank among our\u00a0best audiophile headphones\u00a0of 2024.\nWith improved connectivity that's built on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology with aptX lossless sound quality and ultra-low latency, the new flagship will be able to stream music at higher quality via compatible devices, beating the AirPods Pro 2 in the race to lossless audio. There's Auracast support too, along with improved Adaptive ANC, evolved signature sound tuning, and an upgraded battery system. Plus, there's a Qi charging case and quick charging over USB-C.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds are expected to be available to pre-order from the\u00a0Sennheiser website\u00a0from next month, and will cost $299 / \u00a3259 (approx. AU$499).\nBest bone-conduction headphones\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra\nStraddling the line between audio, fitness and AI verticals, the Mojawa's HaptiFit Terra is an integrated smart sports device that combines haptic technology, bone conduction audio and AI Sports Trainer. As someone who's always listening to a motivational playlist when training at the gym, this Mojawa could help fitness fans to the next level.\nAlthough I haven't managed to try them out just yet, I am intrigued by Mojawa\u2019s claims that the HaptiFit Terra delivers a first-of-its-kind integrated smart sport experience for athletes to up their game, shifting fitness tracking from post-workout to real-time. The over-ear design is said to be lightweight and comfortable, providing dynamic sound and sports tracking. Mojawa says: \"The audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals with insights such as heart rate, pace, step count, calories, swimming lap and distance, and more for users to adjust their speed, set new personal records, and achieve more.\"\nThe audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals.\nLike the new Shokz OpenSwim Pro that I mentioned in my best headphones and earbuds at CES 2024, the Mojawa connects via Bluetooth and has 32GB of storage so users can train without their phone, and it's protected to IP68 making it a useful all-in-one option for swimmers. Battery life runs to 8 hours and recharges are said to complete in just one hour.\nThe Mojawa HaptiFit Terra will be available in March for $299 and is available for pre-order now via the Mojawa website with $100 off.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Whether you consider yourself an audiophile or a casual music and audio enjoyer, there were plenty of audio gadgets at CES 2024 that are sure to amplify your cool factor.\nAlso: CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nIf you're familiar with CES, you're probably used to the annual tech show being full of incredulous concepts and ideas that may never come to life. But those kinds of announcements are fewer and far between, and many products announced at CES this year are either already available for purchase or will hit the shelves soon. So, if you're interested in anything on this list, it can be yours before the year is over.\nFrom Bluetooth-enabled turntables to highly sophisticated sound systems, CES proved to be a productive and exciting venue for audio enthusiasts. We've rounded up some of the best audio gear from CES 2024 below.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung's Music Frame is like the audio version of the company's Frame TV. Samsung fitted the Music Frame with SpaceFit technology, which can appropriately calibrate the room in which the frame resides to fill each corner with sound.\nThe Music Frame is compatible with Dolby Atmos, an audio technology that provides spatial audio tech for immersive sound. Samsung's Music Frame is a functional picture frame, so you can place photos in it to match your space's aesthetic.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 products impressed me\nInserting a picture into the Music Frame shouldn't interfere with the frame's audio output, as the frame's two woofers, tweeters, and mid-range drivers are on the back of the frame. The Music Frame is Wi-Fi and Bluetooth-compatible, meaning you can connect it to compatible TV speakers.\nSamsung didn't announce a price or availability for the Music Frame, but it's expected to be available later this year.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire turntable\nTurntables and vinyl records never went out of style, surviving both the MP3 and music streaming eras. As a result, audio companies announce a new and improved turntable at almost every CES. This year, Victrola, an American audio company with a long history in the turntable industry, announced the Stream Sapphire turntable.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nThe Stream Sapphire sports high-end audio specs like a bespoke walnut veneer plinth, an Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge, and support for 24-bit / 48kHz lossless FLAC audio. Although this spinner is meant for vinyl, users can connect the Stream Sapphire with any device that supports Apple AirPlay or Google Chromecast for Bluetooth audio.\nThe Stream Sapphire will launch this spring at a retail price of $1,499.\nSamsung HW-Q990D\nAlong with the Music Frame, Samsung announced a few new soundbars at CES. Samsung refreshed its flagship soundbar series and unveiled the HW-Q990D. Fitted with an 11.1.4-channel configuration, 22 drivers, Dolby Atmos, and Samsung Q-Symphony, users can expect clear, immersive audio for their home theater.\nSamsung Q-Symphony allows users to choose two audio profiles, central and expansive, which alter the direction of the audio output. The HW-Q990D is a highly capable soundbar, and its features, like Roon integration and Active Voice Amplifier Pro, make it a soundbar geared toward those who take their home audio very seriously.\nAlso: Samsung unveils 2024 TVs with AI features that you'd actually want to use\nAccording to Samsung, the HW-Q990D soundbar leverages AI to balance sound and enhance audio performance.\nSamsung did not disclose pricing and availability for the HW-Q990D soundbar.\nJBL speakers\nJBL upgraded three portable speakers and unveiled two new boom box speakers at CES 2024. The JBL Xtreme 4, JBL Clip 5, JBL Go 4, PartyBox Club 120, and PartyBox Club 320 all appeared.\nThere weren't any significant enhancements in the portable speakers, but JBL says the upgraded speakers have better sound and improved Bluetooth connectivity. Additionally, JBL equipped all of its new speakers with Bluetooth Auracast, allowing your devices to connect to an unlimited amount of Bluetooth-enabled devices.\nAlso: JBL announces a bunch of beefed-up speakers, headphones, and earbuds at CES\nThe latest speakers from JBL will be available on JBL's website this summer, with prices ranging from $50 to $600.\nLodge Solar Powered Speaker 4 Series 2\nAhead of CES, Lodge, an audio company specializing in audiophile-grade outdoor audio equipment, announced the Solar Powered Speaker 4 Series 2. Lodge says this speaker is the first weatherproof outdoor speaker with self-charging capabilities and premium audio.\nLodge showcased the new outdoor speaker at CES and said it's equipped with Bluetooth 5.3, a 50-watt amplifier, a 24-bit / 94kHz sampling rate, a 4-inch driver, and a 4-inch passive sub. Due to the complexity of outdoor acoustics, the Lodge outdoor speaker features LodgeLink, Lodge's software for multiple speaker connectivity.\nAlso: The best CES 2024 tech you can buy right now\nAccording to the company, Lodge's outdoor speaker has 180 square inches of solar panels for charging, and users can expect 20 hours of playtime. The speaker has an IP66 rating and can operate in weather conditions ranging from 32 degrees Fahrenheit to 113 degrees Fahrenheit.\nThe Lodge Solar Powered Speaker 4 Series 2 is available to purchase on Lodge's website for $449.\nFocal Aria Evo X loudspeakers\nFocal, a French audio company famed for its Hi-Fi audio systems, refreshed its iconic line of Aria loudspeakers at CES 2024. The new Aria Evo X features reworked sound technologies, like a new inverted M-shaped dome tweeter, midrange speakers with patented Tuned Mass Damper tech, and stronger woofer magnets.\nFocal says the Aria Evo X loudspeakers have improved balance, treble reproduction, and an extended frequency range. The Aria Evo X features a new reflective varnish to enhance the sophisticated aesthetic while embracing modern design elements.\nAlso: The best smart home tech at CES 2024\nThe Aria Evo X lineup will be available to purchase in February and includes three floorstanding speakers, one bookshelf speaker, one center speaker, and a pair of surround speakers.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best audio tech at CES 2024: next-gen wireless headphones, speakers and more\nThe 23 best audio products and concepts we saw at CES 2024\nTo say that CES 2024 has delighted and surprised us is an understatement, with audio innovations, wireless wizardry and great-sounding gadgets taking their place upfront and center stage (and rightly so).\nCES 2024 proper kicked off on Tuesday, January 9 and ran until Friday, January 12, 2024 (oh, we didn't want it to end!), and over the course of the event, manufacturers from BREGGZ to Bose, EarFun to FiiO, Hidizs to Kanto, Naqi to Sonos, Sony to Victrola and myriad more showed off their latest audio tech, concept ideas, prototypes and ready-for-market products.\nThe sonic treats unveiled will soon be vying for a spot on our best headphones, best turntables, and best wireless earbuds lists, once we can get our hands on them and put them through our fully star-rated review process. That said, we've had people on the ground in Las Vegas throughout the event, so our ears-on coverage might be all that's needed for you to decide whether a product is worth snapping up now \u2013 or as soon as its hits the shelves.\nWe've rounded up the 23 most exciting audio tech announcements revealed at CES 2024 \u2013 so strap in and get comfortable, there's plenty here to enjoy.\nSpeakers, turntables, streamers and, er\u2026 cassette players\nWant to improve your home theater surround-sound system or upgrade your speakers? CES 2024 is the place to find out what's hot right now; we've been treated to a veritable smorgasbord of home audio solutions.\nFirst up is the unique LG Labs DukeBox (above), a concept translucent OLED screen-toting valve amp jukebox with fireside visuals \u2013\u00a0yes, that's really as good a summary as we can muster. Billed as \"an innovative audio product that seamlessly combines the charm of vacuum tube audio with cutting-edge transparent OLED panel technology\", we have to admire the idea: classic sensibilities mixed with state-of-the-art technology.\nElsewhere, Sonus Faber unveiled arguably the most high-ticket item at CES, the Sonus Faber Suprema speaker system, yours for a cool $750,000 (and who's to say it isn't worth every last cent?). At the other end of the food chain, JBL brought special sonic Auracast powers to its most lovable and affordable next-gen JBL Clip 5 speaker.\nOn that note, our very own Matt Bolton attended a very special Auracast demo at CES involving faux airport lounges and the like, and he truly believes the audio broadcasting tech will change our relationship with our headphones \u2013 and with each other.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X is a five-strong lineup of Focal speakers unveiled at CES \u2013 and, frankly, we think the availability of a moss green finish option alone makes it the floorstander to beat at CES.\nIf you want a speaker around which to build a multi-room wireless audio system or one to connect to a turntable, the new Audio Pro C20 could be it. I've written\u00a0love letters to this firm's stunning speaker output, and with the slightly bigger C20, the company has broadened its already extensive connectivity options.\nBy adding a phono stage, Audio Pro's new speaker can be plugged straight into your turntable, allowing you to simply power it on, lower that needle and get into the groove! Of course, this is Audio Pro (maker of some of the\u00a0best wireless speakers\u00a0on the planet), so the new C20 also features AirPlay 2,\u00a0Google\u00a0Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth, ARC and multi-room capability, too.\nDon't have a turntable yet? Don't you worry, we've just the thing\u2026\nIf it's a new plate-spinner you're after, Victrola's extensive CES rollout included a slew of hot decks. Our favorite? We've narrowed it down to either the Victrola Automatic, a fully automatic turntable with a first-of-its-kind \"Repeat\" feature to continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record, or the Victrola Stream Sapphire (pictured above), the company's new best-in-class flagship wireless turntable, which now works with multiple streaming ecosystems. What makes it so good? The Victrola Stream Sapphire builds on the DNA of Victrola\u2019s inaugural October 2022 Stream deck \u2013\u00a0which you can learn about in our dedicated\u00a0Victrola Stream Carbon review\u00a0\u2013 by expanding on its connectivity solutions, to stream vinyl in \"stunning clarity\" to UPnP and Roon-integrated systems as well as Sonos, plus support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nIf that\u2019s not old-school enough, feast your eyes on this ode to the original 1979 Sony Walkman, the FiiO C13. That's right, we came to CES 2024 and saw a portable cassette player. There's no Bluetooth, so forget wireless listening (this is real retro; you've got to live it), plus the only new-fangled feature is the USB-C charging port, so you won't need to keep buying batteries. It does have a rewind button, though, so there will be no flipping the tape over and fast-forwarding to go back to the start of your jam, right before the beat drops.\nBack to the future (see what we did there) of audio and FiiO's been busy here, too \u2013check out the little bijou music maestro above, the FiiO R9. In a nutshell, it's the compact music system with smartphone-esque screen I need in my life, because it's so multi-faceted it's hard to know what to call it. DAC/amp streamer? Music hub? Entire just-add-speakers music streaming system?\u00a0It's all of these things \u2013 and, refreshingly, it takes up about the same room in you home as a houseplant.\nFiiO calls it a \"flagship desktop audio player/streamer & balanced DAC/amplifier\". We call it a fantastically featured and great-looking little proposition.\nSoundbars\nAdding a soundbar (or upgrading the one you have) can add oodles of separation, immersion and bass clout to your home entertainment setup, and CES 2024 has delivered standard \"bar-and-sub\" propositions and quirky space-saving options in equal measure.\nTake Samsung, which revealed its 2024 soundbar lineup at CES, headlined by the Samsung HW-Q990D (above), which is the successor to the fantastic\u00a0Samsung HW-Q990C \u2013 one of the\u00a0best Dolby Atmos soundbars\u00a0available. It has 11.1.4 channels (the same as the Q990C), supports wireless Dolby Atmos, and now comes with\u00a04K\u00a0120Hz passthrough for games consoles, something the Q990C lacked. There\u2019s also Party Play mode, which tunes the HW-Q990D to play a balanced sound across the whole system when listening to music, so everyone has the same experience.\nSamsung had an ace up its sleeve, though \u2013 the Music Frame. It's essentially a picture frame that's also a wireless speaker and/or subwoofer, and I think that is both a great idea and a very bad one, in equal measure.\nLook, we adore\u00a0Samsung's The Frame TV, which happily becomes an electronic art gallery\u00a0when you're not bingeing the entire series of Beef on Netflix \u2013\u00a0and as our IKEA-meets-Sonos\u00a0Symfonisk Picture Frame with Wi-Fi Speaker review\u00a0proves, we love an audio solution boasting space-saving style and substance.\u00a0Samsung tells us the Samsung HW-LS60D (aka the technical name for the Music Frame) is the world\u2019s first customizable and personalized wireless speaker with built-in IoT hub, and it's meant to \"be used as a TV speaker, rear speaker, or a subwoofer \u2013 and even pair two for more surround sound options\".\nMusic Frame also boasts Dolby Atmos support and hides two woofers, two tweeters, and two mid-drivers behind your chosen photo (you can digitally print your favorite memories onto the accompanying \"Art Panel\"; a Diasec matte acrylic plate).\nFrom an audio perspective, we must remain cautious: the Music Frame is literally meant to hang on a wall, which\u00a0should\u00a0mean vibrations, articles, echo \u2013 all of the audio nasties. Then again, we love the space-saving, art-loving concept and this is Samsung, after all, so we'll reserve judgement until we've heard it properly.\nHeadphones and earbuds\nCES 2024 has seen a swathe of fantastic wireless earbuds, so it might seem odd to be kicking off with a relatively humble-looking pair (by today's standards) from EarFun. But the EarFun Wave Pro aren't just the company's first ever stab at over-ear headphones; they're also LDAC and hi-res certified, offer noise cancellation and a whopping 80-hour battery life, all for $79.99. Suffice to say, we can't wait to hear them.\nScreens on earbuds' cases are definitely a thing at CES 2024 \u2013 Samsung unveiled a Galaxy Buds case with an OLED screen, but said it had no plans to actually release it, while JBL is sticking to its screen-enhanced earbuds lineup with the new JBL Live 3. They come in three different designs, but they all have one feature in common: JBL's touchscreen Smart Charging Case, which is designed to make it much easier and quicker to access your audio playback and your earbuds' various features \u2013 it's like having a smartwatch screen right on the case.\nWe first saw JBL's screen-enhanced case in the JBL Tour Pro 2, and were fans initially: in our\u00a0JBL Tour Pro 2 review we said that the case was \"a thing of beauty\". However, the novelty kind of wore off, over time, in favor of our trusty phone and JBL's excellent companion app.\nThere are three options in the JBL Live 3 range: Buds, Beam and Flex. As with their current incarnations, the Buds 3 look most like standard earbuds; the Beam 3 are like\u00a0Apple's AirPods Pro, sporting a stick design and an in-ear fit; the Flex 3 are like regular AirPods, with a stick design but no silicone tip that sits right in the ear canal. All three have JBL's True Adaptive Noise Cancelling and\u00a0Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio.\nThe next big thing in portable listening gear at CES 2024? Neural headphones. If the idea of your headphones being able to read your mind doesn't sit easy with you, calm yourself with the thought that products such as the CES Innovation Award honoree Naqi Neural Earbuds and NeurGear ZenBud are designed not to neurohack your noggin and control your actions, but to help you out \u2013\u00a0either by giving you full, hands-free control over your Windows or Mac computer, including typing, browsing, online shopping and gaming (Naqi); or by stimulating your Vagus nerve using ultrasonic sound waves to relax you (NeurGear).\nWe've been covering similar tech since June of last year, with the Neurable headphones. It seems the idea really is here to stay, and if it could potentially act as a safe and non-invasive alternative to brain implants, we're all for it.\nElsewhere, BREGGZ has unveiled a new \"hearable\": made-to-measure earbuds that both promise a custom fit better than even hand-made molds. They're are also being touted as \"the world\u2019s first truly wireless, custom-made in-ear computer\".\nIn a resoundingly positive nod to sustainability, BREGGZ's IEMs also utilize a unique, patented \"one-box\" technology, where all of the hardware and firmware is processed in a mini cartridge, which can be easily replaced if (or when) the user wants to upgrade to a newer version, or following a battery charge decrease over time.\nBut what of the heavy-hitters? Sennheiser has unveiled the new Momentum True Wireless 4 along with the Accentum Plus, and Momentum Sport for every kind of listener \u2013\u00a0but the headline grabber is the Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds, billed as \"Sennheiser's most capable earbud yet\". They're built around the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform \u2013 which is also going to be a really big deal in 2024 \u2013 and Snapdragon Sound, which means aptX lossless sound quality, as well as exceptionally low latency. The Bluetooth version is 5.4 with confirmed support for\u00a0Auracast, improved ANC, something Sennheiser calls \"evolved tuning\", and upgraded batteries to boot.\nAlso landing were the Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7 wireless earbuds \u2013 chic, hi-res Audio-Technica earbuds with LDAC streaming for less \u2013 and, in the wired realm, the Hidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs, which not only boast hi-res audio support but also a DAC built into the USB-C connector.\nIt's a simple audiophile-friendly solution that means levelling up your wired audio with a separate DAC dongle to get the goods will no longer be necessary \u2013 making the ST2 Pro almost certainly a serious audio upgrade for your iPhone 15, Android phone, Mac or PC.\nHi-Fi acessories\nTechRadar's Josephine Watson (Managing Editor, Lifestyle) tried Nanoleaf's new music-syncing software at CES, and discovered that house parties will never be the same. Nanoleaf announced a spring 2024 release along with\u00a0news of its new outdoor lights\u00a0(which she also saw at CES, and they're\u00a0gorgeous), describing the software as \u00a0a \u201creal-time audio-visual experience\u201d.\nNanoleaf Orchestrator is a new desktop-based music interpretation engine that actually analyzes your music itself, to create a comprehensive light show with your devices. Not only can Orchestrator create a palette of colors based on your chosen song's vibe or mood, it also lets you customize which lights respond to which musical passages or frequencies of a song.\u00a0Want your bulbs to pulse along with the bassline while your smart light panels react to the mids or highs? Done.\nWant to take your music out of your home and on the road? TechRadar's Senior Editor of Home Entertainment, Al Griffin, has you covered. He got to experience a Mercedes-Benz S 580 tricked out with a 4D sound system furnished by German manufacturer Burmester at CES. The 31-speaker Burmester 4D configuration is an option for the latest MBUX-generation infotainment system in Mercedes-Benz vehicles, and it allows for Atmos-compatible tracks to be streamed in an immersive format from\u00a0Apple\u00a0Music and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0Music.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: This Is the Best Audio Gear We Spotted\nAt CES 2024, we spotted plenty of audio products, from a totally wacky speaker with a built-in picture frame to practical offline translation earbuds. The concepts and products displayed at CES never cease to amaze, even if many of them ship months or years later, or not at all. This is not the conference to attend if you want to buy products today, but if you want a peak at the future of tech, there's no better place to be. Here are the best of these audio products from CES 2024.\nSamsung's musical picture frame\nRemember Samsung's popular The Frame TV? If you have one of these, or even if you don't, you should check out the Samsung Music Frame, which is a speaker with an integrated photo frame. It has a square frame (12.9 inches on each side) and it ships with an actual print, which you'll be able to customize before ordering, per Samsung. (In other words, it doesn't have a digital screen for downloading or swapping images on the fly, like a digital photo frame.) The company says this speaker provides surround sound when paired with its 2024 lineup of TVs and soundbars, but it can function as a standalone Bluetooth speaker too.\nA speaker to help with that inaudible dialogue\nOne of the biggest problems with modern movies is that the dialogue track is often too hard to hear. If you're tired of sound effects sounding too loud and not being able to understand the dialogue, the Mirai speaker might interest you. It claims to enhance dialogue audio so that you won't have to keep looking for subtitles again. Unlike a lot of the future-looking tech at CES, this one's available right now for $300.\nWaterproof earbuds that sit outside your ears\nThe popular accessories brand Anker is showing off a pair of earbuds called Soundcore Aerofit, which it calls the \"world's first open-ear earbuds with waterproofing.\" The Aerofit has an IPX7 waterproof rating, which means that you can submerge this pair of headphones in up to 1 meter of water for up to 30 minutes. The open-ear design means that it sits just outside the ear canal, which may be more comfortable for some people. Anker already sells the Aerofit Pro, which has an inferior IPX5 waterproof rating. The new Aerofit offers up to 11 hours of playback on a single charge, which can be extended up to 42 hours with the charging case, according to Anker.\nA sleek soundbar for your monitor\nWhen we talk about soundbars, we mostly refer to speakers for TVs, but the Blueant Soundblade is a soundbar designed for monitors. The speaker is being showcased at CES 2024 and its sleek design immediately caught our eye. If you place it under your monitor, it'll look far more like a stand than a speaker. It supports 3.5mm aux input, USB-C, and Bluetooth 5.3. The product is available in five colors and you can pre-order it at $200. The company claims that you won't be charged until the product ships.\nEarbuds that offer offline translation\nMymanu Clik 2 is a pair of wireless earbuds that supports live translation both in-person and online. Its makers claim that the product has an eSIM and supports wifi too, and that its translation tools can be accessed offline. This product has been selected as an honoree in CES' Innovation Awards. Although pricing and availability are unclear, you can take a look at the Mymanu Clik S on the company's website to get a general idea about pricing and features.\nReducing cable clutter in home theater setups\nAn audio video receiver (AVR) is at the center of nearly every home theater setup. This creates a mass of cables behind your TV and running to each speaker in your setup. Audio Cu is a product that can replace the AVR for home theater audio and lets you reduce cable clutter by distributing sound over power. The company claims that you can connect an audio transmitter to your TV and a receiver to each speaker. The transmitter sends sound via power to each Audio Cu receiver. This means that a couple of cables will go from your TV to Audio Cu's transmitter, and each speaker will run one cable to each receiver unit. Audio Cu claims to Dolby Atmos for audio as well. The project was initially funded via Indiegogo, and it's now an honoree at CES 2024's innovation awards.\nPranay Parab is an independent tech journalist based in Mumbai, India. He covers tech for Lifehacker, and specializes in tutorials and in-depth features.\nLifehacker has been a go-to source of tech help and life advice since 2005.

See our ethics statement.\nThe best audio products of CES 2024\nEvery year, we filter out the noise at CES to find the most innovative audio announcements. Across headphones, speakers, and more, we look for the products that we think will be most important to consumers in 2024 and beyond. This year, we met with dozens of audio companies and saw hundreds of new audio products. We have hand-selected the top products that caught our eye from everything announced at the show. Here are the best audio products of CES 2024!\nThe Sennheiser MOMENTUM Sport brings advanced biometric tracking to wireless earbuds\nWith an integrated photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor, the Sennheiser MOMENTUM Sport outputs biometric data directly to popular fitness devices and apps. This makes it easy to track your workouts in Apple Health, Garmin Connect, Strava, Polar, Peloton, and more. Designed for runners, the earbuds have an acoustic relief channel to minimize noise from your footsteps. The MOMENTUM Sport also has a semi-open design for environmental awareness, alongside adjustable transparency mode, anti-wind mode, and adaptive noise canceling. With IP55 water and dust resistance, and a shock-proof chassis, these are the top fitness earbuds we saw at CES 2024.\nWith the MOMENTUM True Wireless 4, Sennheiser brings the latest connectivity technology\nSennheiser delivered another exciting product with the MOMENTUM True Wireless 4. Built on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform with Snapdragon Sound, these buds from Sennheiser have the latest and greatest in connectivity technology. Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast supports future-proofs the MOMENTUM True Wireless 4, while aptX lossless and low-latency provide an exceptional connection to most devices today. The earbuds also bring improved adaptive ANC, new tuning, and an upgraded battery system.\nThe JBL Extreme 4 is built to last with a replaceable battery\nThe JBL Extreme 4 has a ton of features that elevate it above your standard portable Bluetooth speaker. Using what JBL calls AI Sound Boost, the speaker analyzes incoming audio in real-time to deliver the maximum output level without distortion. The speaker now has a user-replaceable battery that works with some of JBL\u2019s other speakers, such as the new PartyBox speakers, which will extend the lifespan once the battery has worn out. Made with 70% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic, this speaker is future-proof with Auracast support for multi-speaker connection.\nThe Live 3 Earbuds feature touchscreen controls and multiple fit options\nPreviously seen on the JBL Tour Pro 2, JBL has now brought touchscreen controls to the more affordable JBL Live 3 series of earbuds. The touchscreen on the charging case gives you full control over all of the functionality normally found in the JBL companion app. The Live 3 comes in three design styles: Buds, Beam, and Flex. Buds is a closed bud-style earbud without a stem, Beam is a closed stick-style earbud with a stem, and Flex is an open design for increased awareness. Later this year, JBL will be launching an at-home earbud fit test that will scan your ears using your phone camera to determine the shape and size of your ears, and then ask a series of questions about how you plan to use your earbuds. With this information, the software will suggest which of the three design options is best for you.\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra brings Ai to bone conduction\nThe Mojawa HaptiFit Terra was a surprise to see at CES 2024. It has all the capabilities of devices like the Shokz OpenSwim Pro but adds AI-enhanced training features to bone-conduction listening. This device can talk to you with real-time workout metrics and vital signs, keeping athletes informed. It has an IP68 waterproof rating, so you can wear it underwater, pressure-sensitive haptic controls, adjustable safety lights for visibility, substantial music storage of 32GB, and a battery life of eight hours. Additionally, its companion app not only tracks athletic progress but also offers customizable exercise plans and training regimes. The HaptiFit Terra\u2019s comprehensive approach to training assistance and athlete safety is what truly caught our eye, making it a worthy recipient of our awards.\nEnjoy advanced headphone features at an affordable price with the EarFun Wave Pro\nThe EarFun Wave Pro headphones offer some pretty great features at an accessible price point. These headphones have hybrid active noise cancelation (ANC), capable of reducing up to 45dB of ambient noise, and an Anti-Wind Noise feature. Priced at just $79.99, the Wave Pro supports high-quality LDAC audio coding and Bluetooth multipoint.\nAdditionally, the EarFun Wave Pro is equipped with a low-latency game mode and voice assistant support. One of its most impressive attributes is its extraordinary battery life, offering up to 80 hours of playtime (55 hours with ANC enabled) on a mere two-hour charge, along with the capability for wired connections. These combined qualities, particularly at such an affordable price, make the EarFun Wave Pro a standout choice for consumers.\nProtect your ears while staying connected with the 3M PELTOR WS ALERT XP Headset\nThis product isn\u2019t the most eye-catching, but it might be the most useful piece of audio tech we saw at CES 2024. The 3M PELTOR WS ALERT XP is a Bluetooth safety headset that uses light to charge its battery. On a sunny day, you can wear the 3M PELTOR WS ALERT XP without ever having to worry about running out of charge. With a noise canceling microphone and a Push-to-Listen (PTL) feature to help workers stay aware of their surroundings, this device may be a game changer in industries such as aviation or construction."

From the latest flagship noise-canceling headphones to new-age wireless turntables, gorgeous active speakers to incredibly elaborate Dolby Atmos soundbars \u2014 it's all there.\nBelow, we've rounded up the coolest new audio gear that's been announced at CES 2024 so far.\nThe show runs through January 12th, and we'll continue updating this post as new gear gets revealed.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung's Music Frame is part speaker and part picture frame. It's a wireless speaker that you hang on your wall and it disguises itself as artwork. The speaker has six drivers (two tweeters, two mid-range drivers and two woofers) and supports Bluetooth and Wi-Fi streaming. If you have a Samsung TV or soundbar, you can configure it as a surround sound speaker, as well. Samsung will sell a variety of different prints you'll be able to display on it, too.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: this spring\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nVictrola made waves last year when it announced the Stream Carbon ($699), the company's most high-end turntable to date and, more significantly, the first turntable to work natively with Sonos. At this year's CES, Victrola has announced an even higher-end turntable, the Stream Sapphire, with more premium components and more wireless streaming capabilities. It works with Sonos, Roon and the Universal Plug and Play protocol (UPnP), meaning you can connect to an AV receiver or smart TV. It's also capable of streaming lossless FLAC audio files (up to 24-bit/48kHz).\nPrice: $1,499Availability: this spring\nSennheiser Momentum TW 4\nSennheiser Momentum TW 4\nThe Sennheiser Momentum TW 4s are the company's new flagship noise-canceling wireless earbuds. They look virtually identical to their predecessor, the 2022-released Momentum TW 3s, but the new earbuds have improved battery, more powerful noise-cancellation and improved sound (thanks to aptX lossless support).\nPrice: $300Availability: preorder on February 15; available February 20\nSamsung HW-Q990D\nSamsung HW-Q990D\nThe Samsung HW-Q990D is the company's new flagship Dolby Atmos soundbar system for 2024. Like its predecessor, the much-lauded HW-Q990C, the HW-Q990D is a 11.1.4-channel system (with 22 total drivers) that connects wirelessly to a compatible Samsung TV. The difference this year is that the HW-Q990D has a built-in HDMI 2.1 port, making it much better for connecting next-gen consoles or 4K streamers. It also supports Roon for audiophiles who have other Roon-ready speakers.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: TBD\nAudio-Technica ATH-TWX7\nAudio Technica ATH-TWX7\nThe Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7s are the company's newest pair of noise-canceling wireless earbuds. They have the same 5.8mm drivers as the company's flagship ATH-TWX9s ($299), but they're considerably cheaper \u2014 just don't expect their noise-canceling to be as good. One notable upgrade is that these new earbuds support LDAC streaming (up to 24-bit/96kHz), although you'll need a compatible Android smartphone to take advantage of it.\nPrice: $199Availability: now\nAudio Pro C20\nAudio Pro C20\nAudio Pro's C20 is a minimalist wireless speaker that can just about do it all. It supports Wi-Fi (AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect) and Bluetooth streaming. It has an HDMI ARC input so you can use it as a miniature soundbar for your TV, and it has a built-in MM phono stage for connecting a turntable.\nPrice: $550Availability: February 2024\nJBL Live 3 Earbuds\nJBL Live TWS 3\nJBL announced three pairs of noise-canceling wireless earbuds in its Live 3 series: the Live Buds 3 (earbuds), Live Beam 3 (stem, shown) and Live Flex 3 (open-ear). The three wireless earbuds share most of the same features, with the big difference being their design and fit. Maybe most significantly, all have a charging case with a built-in display (just like last year's JBL Tour Pro 2) that allows you to control playback without opening your smartphone.\nPrice: $200Availability: summer 2024\nHidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs\nHidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs\nHidizs announced the ST2 Pros, digital in-ear monitors that look to be a perfect partner to today's iPhone 15 line. They have a built-in DAC (ESS ES9281C PRO) and a USB-C connector, so you can plug them directly into your newest iPhone (or MacBook). They can play lossless audio files with support for PMC (up to 32-Bit/384kHz), DSD128 and MQA. And they have pretty stunning, mostly transparent design.\nPrice: TBDAvailability: TBD\nJBL Clip 5, Xtreme 4 and Go 4\nJBL Clip 5\nJBL announced next-gen versions of most of its ultra-portable Bluetooth speakers \u2014 there's the new Xtreme 4 ($380), Clip 5 ($80, shown) and Go 4 ($50). All have been updated to sound better (and get louder), have improved battery life and connectivity (including support for Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio), and have a more environment-friendly design.\nPrice: $50\u2013$380Availability: June 2024\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nSennhesier Momentum Sport\nThe Momentum Sports are new sport-focused wireless earbuds from Sennheiser. They're considerably different from last year's models, the Sport True Wireless, because they have more flagship-level features and, uniquely, integrated sensors for monitoring heart rate and body temperature. The neat thing is the Momentum Sports are compatible with most of today's most popular training apps \u2014 including Apple Fitness+, Garmin, Strava, Peloton and Polar \u2014 so syncing over these additional metrics is a breeze.\nPrice: $300Availability: April 2024\nSennheiser Accentum Plus\nSennheiser Accentum Plus\nThese mid-range noise-canceling wireless headphones fall between the company's Accentum ($180) and flagship Momentum 4 Wireless ($350). The \"Plus\" models look mostly the same as their budget-friendly sibling, the Accentum, but they have more features. For instance, the Plus models have swipe/touch controls (instead of buttons), wear detection sensors and a 3.5mm headphone jack for connection to more traditional analog sources. Sennheiser has also given them better ANC abilities and improved sound (thanks to support for aptX Adaptive).\nPrice: $230Availability: February 20"

However, the Sapphire adds to this with UPnP and\u00a0Roon\u00a0support too, enabling playback through a whole load more compatible devices, all without the need for any further equipment.\nOf course, there are also gold-plated RCA outputs for traditional wired systems and powered speakers too.

Its internal storage comes in three sizes: 2TB, 4TB and 8TB. Multiroom audio setups are also supported.\nCosting $3699 before adding storage (and your Roon subscription), this is a something of luxury purchase, to say the least.

        "raw_content": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too.

Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line.

It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels.

This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality.

It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast.

This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use.

The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

In addition to our wide selection of headphones, visitors and attendees were also able to experience the authentic analog sound of vinyl records from A-T turntables, like the legendary AT-SB727 Sound Burger.\nTurntables, Microphones, Headphones, and More\nThe Audio-Technica booth wouldn\u2019t be complete without showcasing our complete lineup of turntables, like the new to vinyl LP60X series, including the AT-LP60XBT. Content creation microphones were also on display, including USB microphones like the AT2020USB-X, AT2020USB-XP, and the AT2040USB, alongside wired versions.\nWired and Wireless headphones were also available for visitors to test and experience in real-time, like the critically acclaimed and fan-favorite M-Series line, including the ATH-M50x, its second generation, wireless counterpart, the ATH-M50xBT2, and the ATH-M50xSTS StreamSet\u2122, featuring the the legendary studio sound of the ATH-M50x headphones with the clarity of the iconic 20 Series microphones.\nCopyright \u00a9 Audio-Technica U.S, Inc.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.
