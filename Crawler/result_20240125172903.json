Additionally, the company has successfully integrated this series of chips with its parent company, MediaTek, and their Dimensity Auto platform, providing highly integrated solutions and technical testing services to automotive manufacturers worldwide.\nThe reliability and safety requirements for automotive electronic components are significantly higher than those for consumer electronic products. AEC-Q100 is the certification standard specifically designed for automotive chips. In the standard declaration process, Airoha Technology's AG3335MA series chips have obtained AEC-Q100 certification conducted by a third-party quality management system with an automotive specification laboratory. This certification is divided into five Grades based on the extreme temperature range within the vehicle usage scenarios. The AG3335MA series chips have achieved certification at the Grade 2, covering a temperature range from -40 to 105 degrees Celsius for reliability testing.\nThe AG3335MA series are satellite positioning chip known for its ultra-low power consumption, high endurance, dual-frequency capability, support for the five major global satellite systems, and NavIC. This chip series can operate reliably in extreme environments, ranging from -40 to 105 degrees Celsius. It features a professional-grade GNSS receiver measurement engine with an ultra-low satellite tracking sensitivity of -167 dBm and an extremely short cold boot positioning time of 25 seconds. Additionally, it boasts an internationally leading signal frequency support capability, allowing it to simultaneously receive and process signals from all visible satellites in the sky. This capability ensures accurate positioning in all weather conditions and effectively addresses challenges such as adverse weather and complex road conditions faced by vehicle drivers.\nAiroha Technology is consecutively under the development of GNSS technology since 2017. The product market share has consistently ranked among the top three globally. With the automotive industry undergoing a significant transformation, there is a substantial increase in demand for related chips, presenting Airoha Technology\u2019s automotive satellite positioning chips with significant growth opportunities on top of their existing foundation. \u201cAiroha Technology\u2019s automotive GNSS chip series not only complies with AECQ100 standards but has also been designed-in by several key customers.\u201d Said by Yang Yuquan, Vice President of Airoha Technology. \u201cCurrently, we are actively pursuing ISO 26262 automotive functional safety process and product certification, demonstrating Airoha Technology\u2019s commitment to the safety and reliability of its automotive GNSS chips and its determination to enter the automotive market.\u201d\nNews Attachment\nAEC-Q100 Reliability Qualification Standards comprises 13 technical standards, including High Temperature Operating Life (HTOL), Preconditioning, Early Life Failure Rate (ELFR), High Temperature Storage (HTS), Powered temperature Cycling (PTC), etc.\nAEC-Q100 according to operating temperature divides into 5 Grades: Grade 0: operating temperature ranges from -40 \u02daC ~150 \u02daC Grade 1: operating temperature ranges from -40 \u02daC ~125 \u02daC Grade 2: operating temperature ranges from -40 \u02daC ~105 \u02daC Grade 3: operating temperature ranges from -40 \u02daC ~85 \u02daC Grade 4: operating temperature ranges from -40 \u02daC ~70 \u02daC\n5 GNSS satellite constellations and NavIC: include GPS (US), Quasi-Zenith Satellite System (QZSS) of Japan, Galileo of Europe, Beido of China, and Navigation with Indian Constellation (NavIC) the Indian regional navigation system.\nGNSS: (Global Navigation Satellite System): is a general term describing any satellite constellation in global that provides positioning, navigation services. These satellite constellations include 5 major global constellations and some regional ones with limited coverage.\ndBm: receiver sensitivity refers to the lowest level of electromagnetic wave energy that a receiver can detect, measured in dBm. Sensitivity is expressed in negative values, with smaller negative values indicating the receiver\u2019s ability to detect weaker signal strengths and thus higher sensitivity.\nISO 26262: is internally recognized automotive functional safety standards provide a comprehensive definition of the automotive product safety lifecycle standard. It encompasses not only products at the system and hardware levels but also serves as essential assessment guidelines for software-level product development. Manufacturers must adhere to steps to ensure the safety of each component, reducing the risk of product failures that can subsequently impact the safety and reliability of other hardware or systems. ISO 26262 provides the automotive industry its own proprietary identification system to assess the level of vehicle safety integrity. The higher the level, the more stringent the development process.\nThank you.\nWe will get back to you as soon as possible.\nPrevious\n#\nNext\nLeading IC Designer AIROHA is collaborating with Intel to facilitate the development of new Bluetooth\u00ae Low Energy (LE) Audio devices as part of Engineered for Intel\u00ae Evo\u2122 laptop accessory program\nIn order to enhance the functionality of this website, we will transmit cookies on your device.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "FTTR Solution Extends the \"Last Meter\" of Home Broadband\nFTTR Solution Extends the \"Last Meter\" of Home Broadband\nAs Fibre to the Home (FTTH) becomes more widely available, the fixed broadband bandwidths offered by most operators have moved well beyond the gigabit level. However, the broadband experience for many consumers is still hampered by the inconsistent coverage and the poor quality of home Wi-Fi. This is because most people have chosen a Wi-Fi mesh solution for their indoor network, and most Wi-Fi mesh networks have no choice but to rely on wireless backhaul with no or low Ethernet coverage in home, resulting in poor quality of experience (QoE) for users.\nAIROHA's latest FTTR (Fibre to the Room) solution, which uses a multifunctional home broadband gateway and invisible fibre to significantly reduce homeowners' resistance to surface cabling, simplify the complexity of deployment, bring fibre to every room in the house and provide full fibre coverage throughout the home/community at WAN speeds, ultimately delivering a higher QoE for users and a higher NPS (Net Promoter Score) for operators seeking to improve customer retention and reduce churn.\nFTTR Has Become a Focus for Overcoming Network Bottlenecks: FTTR is the next step up from FTTH in addressing the speed bottleneck of indoor broadband, which is traditionally delivered over a wired Ethernet system or a wireless Wi-Fi mesh network. In many countries, for example in Europe, there are many old, beautiful houses that don't have a concealed conduit for modern internet cabling, while homeowners are concerned that all the drilling and boreholes associated with surface cabling would detract from the building or interfere with the interior layout, and the use of Wi-Fi routers to organize an indoor wireless network has become the most common practice for delivering broadband from the master FTTH gateway to the other floors and rooms in the building. However, Wi-Fi signals are susceptible to various sources of interference, easily blocked by brick or concrete walls, and their shared bandwidth is instantly halved by a cited router in the absence of wired backhaul, resulting in poor user experience and satisfaction.\nNew fibre materials and methods enable \"pain-free\" indoor deployment: The introduction of new fibre materials and fittings has opened up new deployment methods and opportunities for indoor fibre broadband, delivering multi-gigabit indoor connectivity and improved QoE. For example, invisible fibre, with its thin and flexible physical characteristics, can be installed in any corner of a home without the need for drilling and is more aesthetically pleasing due to its transparent materials that are almost invisible to the naked eye. Invisible fibre is becoming increasingly popular with homeowners looking to upgrade their internet speeds. In deployments, FTTR extends the fibre connection from the master FTTR unit to each room by using fibre and fibre routers that act as slave FTTR units instead of Ethernet switches or Wi-Fi repeaters. The fibre routers provide ubiquitous multi-gig coverage with both wired and wireless access points and can be extended to as many corners of a building as required without compromising throughput.\nAN7581 10G-PON SoC provides the most flexible and market-ready FTTR gateway solution: Airoha Technology's AN7581 10G PON SoC is a breakthrough innovation and an ideal option for premium FTTR deployments as it integrates a Wi-Fi 7 and can incorporate an xPON OLT chip to realize an all-in-one CPE unit that can perform the functions of a master FTTR unit, AP router and optical distributor, with both fibre and wireless connectivity interfaces available in a single device. AIROHA's AN7581 is the first SOC that supports both P2MP (point-to-multipoint) and P2P (point-to-point) FTTR solutions with integrated network management capabilities when combined with the flexible/optional use of AIROHA Technology's Ethernet solutions. For example, in the scenario of a large apartment or multi-storey houses, AIROHA's P2P solution is capable of managing over 5 slave ONUs to distribute optical and Wi-Fi services to each of the building units. In the case of a larger project requiring more than 10 slave stations, AIROHA's P2MP becomes the perfect solution to reach a larger number of rooms within an apartment, or offices and classrooms within a company or campus.\nDOWNLAOD\nIn order to enhance the functionality of this website, we will transmit cookies on your device.

Deployed to a number of project areas in collaboration with a U.S. telecom company, the AIROHA IC chips for fiber optical broadband Customer Premise Equipment (CPE) strictly observe standards set by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) with a symmetric speed of 8 gigabits per second verified by Speedtest\u00ae, which is the fastest so far in the real world optical fiber networks, and have set a new benchmark for the introduction of 10G-PON technology amid the world's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and thriving developments of digital content market.\nA subsidiary of the IC giant MediaTeK, AIROHA has more than 20 years of engineering experience in fixed network with an inclusive product portfolio for fixed broadband aimed to provide interoperability and reliability in a highly heterogeneous and stability-demanding environment. The case has demonstrated AIROHA's ability in assisting telecom carriers and network operators to deploy high-performance services to the premises of their customers with faster-than-expected pace and reduced operating and maintenance costs.\nLiving up to promised speed in compliance with FCC and verified with Speedtest\u00ae The Federal Infrastructure Investment and Job Act of 2021 requires the federal government of the U.S. to spend $65 billion on broadband access, which has become the industry's biggest focus. To help establish the credibility of the entire industrial ecosystem, the FCC has set rigid regulations for ensuring that the quality of network services will live up to their providers' promises. In August 2022, AIROHA helped a U.S. telecom operator commercialize the world's first XGS-PON services that achieve a real-world speed of symmetrical 8 Gbps in compliance with FCC regulations. For telecom operators, fiber broadband is not just about providing network speed with stability and reliability, but more essentially, is also about the ability to keep compliance with FCC and earn trust from the broad market.\nThe most critical and difficult part about the U.S. 8 Gbps XGS-PON deployments is to achieve low latency under 3ms as tested against Speedtest\u00ae standards. AIROHA solves this challenge through impeccable software and hardware integration as well as firmware optimization.\nMarket demands are driving fixed-line broadband to migrate toward fiberMarket demands rising from Work from Home (WFH) trend during the COVID-19 pandemic and the rapid developments of content technologies are driving fixed-line broadband operators to migrate to fiber optical cable at an accelerated pace. Innovative applications including 4K and 8K video streaming, AR, VR and Metaverse need high speed data transfer of high-quality video and audio content. Network service providers therefore have been looking into more advanced PON technology of 10G-PON. And, moreover, proposed 25G/50G-PON specifications are looming in the upcoming future.\n20 years' experience in serving over 150 operator clients paved the way to the U.S. market in landing the world's fastest optical broadbandBased upon 20 years of accumulative experience in deploying broadband services for 150+ operator customers, Aroha Technology had been able to help the U.S. telecom carrier to realize the world's first symmetric 8 Gbps broadband services in just two years with a two-phase project.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"
