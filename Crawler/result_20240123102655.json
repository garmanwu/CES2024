        "raw_content": "Wellness Beyond Your Wrist: The 10 Best Health and Fitness Devices of CES 2024\nCES 2024 introduced many high-tech health innovations including a mirror for mindfulness and a 4-in-1 thermometer for home checkups. Check out our 10 favorite fitness gadgets from the show.\nI\u2019m PCMag\u2019s senior analyst covering smart home and wearable devices. I\u2019ve been writing about tech professionally for nearly a decade and have been obsessing about it for much longer than that. Prior to joining PCMag, I made educational videos for an electronics store called Abt Electronics in Illinois, and before that I spent eight years covering the smart home market for CNET.\nAt CES 2024, digital health devices moved beyond the wrist. From mental-health-focused smart mirrors to app-adjustable mattresses, our top 10 picks show that the wellness tech market is rife with innovation. And it's not necessarily the biggest players in the space who are driving it forward, as most of our favorite health and fitness tech at CES come from relatively unknown brands.\nIn no particular order, these are our 10 favorite health and fitness devices from CES this year.\nWithings BeamO\nThe Withings BeamO makes your thermometer look lazy. A \u201cmultiscope\u201d device for at-home health checkups, the BeamO packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to listen to your lungs, and, yes, a thermometer too. Thanks to its multitude of sensors, it promises to detect atrial fibrillation, heart murmurs, wheezing, and more. The device itself looks like a compact remote control, but you can put the thermometer to your forehead, then flip the gadget and place the stethoscope against your chest before using the electrodes to take heart rate and blood oxygenation readings. All of this data can be readily shared with your doctor, and the stethoscope even records audio files. You can be sure that we plan to test the accuracy of this conceptually cool gadget when it launches this June for $249.95.\nBaracoda BMind\nLook into this mirror to discover a reflection of your mind. While Withings is one-upping your thermometer, Baracoda is introducing a smart bathroom mirror that delivers mental health and wellness advice. The Baracoda BMind uses generative AI and natural language processing to understand your daily mood and stress levels. You can use the mirror as a touch screen to browse its CareOS interface and start automatically generated light therapy sessions or mindfulness exercises. Who knew your morning routine could include mirror therapy? Baracoda hasn't announced a price or release date for the BMind.\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nThe BMind focuses on mental health while another smart mirror from the traditionally software-focused NuraLogix uses contactless optical imagery and remote photoplethysmography to gauge both mental well-being and physical metrics such as blood pressure, BMI, facial skin age, heart rate variability, and more. The Anura MagicMirror will be aimed at businesses like gyms and nursing homes rather than your personal bathroom countertop. That likely means it will have a lofty price tag, but Nuralogix hasn\u2019t announced a specific figure or release date.\nLaifen Wave Electric Toothbrush\nWe\u2019ve seen smart toothbrushes at CES before, and the Laifen Wave Electric Toothbrush doesn\u2019t offer a crazy new shape or app-based gimmick. Instead, start-up Laifen promises a \"3x increase in brushing efficiency\" compared with the competition thanks to its servo motor system that allows the toothbrush to vibrate 66,000 times per minute while simultaneously oscillating 60 degrees to thoroughly clean the length of your teeth. If that sounds a bit like taking a belt sander to your mouth, Laifen promises that its Gum Care brush head protects your tissue using 0.02mm ultra-fine tapered bristles. It will also offer Super-Clean and Ultra-Whitening brush heads and you can fine-tune the oscillation range and speed as well as vibration strength in the app. The Laifen Wave Electric Toothbrush will be available to purchase on March 5 from the company\u2019s site and Amazon, with prices varying based on the finish of the handle: $69 for plastic, $79 for aluminum alloy, or $99 for stainless steel.\nGarmin Lily 2\nThe original Garmin Lily is one of our favorite fitness trackers, so we were excited to see its sequel announced at CES. At first glance, the Lily 2 looks quite similar to its predecessor, but the new model replaces some of the previous model's plastic with metal, adds a few new color options, and expands the battery life. Garmin has raised the price by $50 on both the Sport and Classic versions to $249.99 and $279.99 respectively. Otherwise, this looks to be the same stylish and capable Lily, complete with a robust array of health sensors and smart features. If the new styles suit you, the Lily 2 is available now.\nZoe Care Zoe Fall\nThe safety-focused Zoe Fall is like a medical alert system that monitors your well-being from the wall. You simply plug it into a standard wall outlet and the app-connected device uses deep-learning algorithms to determine when someone nearby has fallen based on the disturbances in the surrounding Wi-Fi waves. If you take a tumble, it can send an alert to a caregiver through the app. A single Zoe Fall plug can purportedly monitor up to 800 square feet, and the simple plug-and-play design is aimed at allowing senior citizens to live independently with peace of mind and without needing cameras or wearable gadgets that might violate their privacy or fashion sense. Zoe Care has not yet announced a price or release date for the Zoe Fall.\nElo Smart Gummies\nIf you\u2019re having trouble eating healthy, try these 3D-printed vitamin gummies. Backed by rock climbing legend Tommy Caldwell, the Elo Smart Gummies promise to deliver the nutrition of seven ordinary health pills in just one yummy gummy. The Smart Gummies can be personalized with eight different flavors and 389 million possible combinations of nutrients. They're available on Elo's site now. To select your layers and find out a price, you need to take an online assessment.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nAnssil Smart String i4 Smart Mattress\nWatch out, Sleep Number. Korean start-up Anssil showed off a customizable mattress made of strings at CES. Yes, you read that right. The Smart String i4 doesn\u2019t use air, foam, or springs for support, but 14 million polyester threads. The material supposedly allows it to maintain its shape for longer than traditional mattress materials, and adapt across a wide range of firmness settings. You can pick from 10 adjustable cushion levels in a companion app, and see data collected by the built-in pressure sensor and scale. Thanks to those sensors, the app will show you detailed sleep and health information and can sync with your smart scale or wearable. Anssil hasn't announced pricing or a release date for the Smart String i4.\nUltrahuman Home\nIt might look like a modem, but the Ultrahuman Home is actually a health-tracking device for your environment. Built-in sensors measure air quality, humidity, light, and noise levels. Its software processes sensor data locally and tracks it over time. A companion app highlights any red flags or changes in your environment that might cause different health issues such as rising stress levels or decreased sleep. The $349 device is slated to go on sale via Kickstarter this month.\nInvoxia Minitailz Smart Pet Tracker\nThe Invoxia Minitailz Smart Pet Tracker is a digital health device for your fuzziest family members. It attaches to any cat or dog collar and tracks their heart vitals, respiration, scratching, and more to uncover potential health issues. According to Invoxia, the device is even capable of detecting canine and feline atrial fibrillation (AFib), a serious heart condition. It also tracks your fur baby's daily activities (including barking, eating/eating, resting, running, scratching, and walking) and location. If you want to closely monitor your pet\u2019s health, the dog version is already available on the company\u2019s website and the cat version is expected to arrive in March. Both cost $99.\nThe Best Digital Health Devices You Can Get Now\nFor more high-tech wellness to jump-start your year, check out the best health and fitness tech we've tested.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Wearable tech products stealing the show this year\nAs CES 2024 concludes for another year, it\u2019s an opportune moment to look back at the health and fitness gadgets that made their mark at the event in Las Vegas, which took place between January 9th and 12th.\nCES stands as the world\u2019s most significant and influential technology event. For tech aficionados, it\u2019s an unparalleled experience. Its closest counterpart is IFA, held annually in Berlin at the start of September.\nHistorically, these expos have been pivotal in introducing technologies we now consider commonplace. This year, Fitbit, Fossil, and Xiaomi disappointed with no new announcements. Consistent with previous years, Apple did not participate. Nevertheless, wearables maintained a strong presence in 2024.\nThe event sprawled across 2.75 million square feet, featuring over 2,000 exhibitors. These included manufacturers, developers, and suppliers of consumer technology hardware and content. The conference program boasted more than 1,000 speakers. It\u2019s estimated that over 100,000 attendees visited the event.\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of our top wearable tech picks from the Las Vegas showrooms. These are just a handful of our favorites. Our comprehensive coverage of CES 2024 can be found on this link.\nAmazfit Helio Ring\nOur top pick this year is the Amazfit Helio Ring, a product by Zepp Health, marking their first venture into the realm of smart rings. This device is specifically designed for athletes, focusing on optimizing recovery and enhancing performance. Unlike typical smart rings that mainly track sleep for the general public, the Helio Ring provides in-depth insights into both mental and physical conditions, a feature particularly beneficial for athletes.\nThe Helio Ring\u2019s standout feature is its ability to convert complex health data into a simple Readiness score. By monitoring sleep heart rate, HRV, breathing, and body temperature overnight, the ring, in conjunction with the Zepp App, calculates this score to help athletes decide whether to focus on training or recovery. This aids in planning workouts more effectively. The ring also offers comprehensive sleep and recovery tracking, including analysis of sleep quality, sleep stages, and sleep breathing quality. Additionally, it features EDA emotional monitoring, which assesses physical signs like hand sweat to indicate emotional stress.\nMind you, this is not the only smart ring which made its appearance. Also there were RingConn with their excellent offering, along with Evie Ring, Velia Ring, YogiFi Ring and Dcare Ring. Its shaping up to be an exciting year for smart rings!\nWithings BeamO\nNext up on our list is the Withings BeamO, a groundbreaking health monitoring device that combines the futuristic vision of Star Trek with practical technology. BeamO allows users to perform a 4-in-1 health checkup, including body temperature, heart, and lung health, in under a minute.\nBeamO, the world\u2019s 1st multiscope for revolutionary at-home checkups, was unveiled at #CES2024 \u2014 our booth has been packed with people and the awards just keep coming.If you couldn\u2019t make it to CES or get through the crowds, here\u2019s PM Livia Robic with a personal demo for you. pic.twitter.com/LqZrk9ljzO\nThe thing functions as a thermometer, ECG, oximeter, and stethoscope, using photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodes for accurate readings. BeamO also features a non-contact temperature sensor and a digital stethoscope with a Piezoelectric disc for detailed heart and lung assessments. The data syncs with the Withings Health app, providing insights and enabling telehealth consultations.\nPriced at $249.95 the device is set to be available in June 2024. BeamO is recognized as a CES Innovations Award Honoree and represents a significant advancement in home health monitoring technology.\nGarmin Lily 2\nAnother standout device from CES 2024 is the Garmin Lily 2, a successor to the original Garmin Lily launched in 2021. The Lily 2 retains the stylish and functional appeal of its predecessor but introduces several notable upgrades. It features an improved heart rate sensor, new fitness modes, and NFC payments.\nDesign-wise, the model retains a classic round shape, but the Lily 2 upgrades the build to anodized aluminum for enhanced durability and sophistication. The Lily 2 also simplifies band switching with a more standard lug design. As before, there\u2019s a TFT LCD with 16-level grayscale on-board. The Lily 2 stands out with its Gen 4 Elevate sensor, improving health and fitness tracking, and introduces NFC for contactless payments, a feature absent in the original Lily. Priced slightly higher than the original, the Lily 2 offers a blend of fashion, functionality, and fitness tracking, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a stylish, compact wearable.\nGarmin HRM-Fit\nAlso among our favorite picks from CES 2024 is the Garmin HRM-Fit, a heart rate monitor specifically designed for women. Priced at $150, it offers a snug fit and is compatible with medium to high support sports bras, accommodating a variety of body types. Its design ensures stability and comfort during intense workouts, although it\u2019s advised not to use it with certain types of bras like longline, front zip, and light support variants.\nFunctionally, the HRM-Fit excels in providing precise heart rate data, surpassing the accuracy of wrist-based devices. It supports advanced workout tracking, including metrics like vertical oscillations, ground contact time, and stride length, crucial for detailed running form analysis. With a battery life of up to one year (based on daily one-hour usage) and water resistance up to 50 feet, it\u2019s built for endurance and versatility.\nNowatch hybrid\nNowatch, a Dutch startup, has evolved from a mindful health tracker to a sophisticated hybrid smartwatch, showcased at CES 2024. The original Nowatch, known for its stress prediction using an electrodermal sensor (EDA), has now incorporated Chronos \u2018timepiece faces\u2019, adding the functionality of time display while maintaining its focus on mindfulness and stress awareness.\nThe AI Insights feature provides daily summaries and recommendations based on the wearer\u2019s stress data, sleep, and activity stats. The design of Nowatch, featuring interchangeable discs made of polished metal and gemstones, emphasizes wearability and style. This evolution marks Nowatch\u2019s journey in the wearable technology space, focusing on aesthetics, mindfulness, and a user-customizable experience.\nUltrahuman Home\nUltrahuman has introduced Ultrahuman Home at CES 2024, a device that tracks and enhances the health of living spaces. This innovative product extends Ultrahuman\u2019s wearable tech expertise to environmental health monitoring. It provides insights into factors like artificial light, air quality, humidity, and noise levels, correlating them with individual lifestyle factors such as sleep and stress.\nIntroducing Ultrahuman Home! It is a sleek yet powerful device that will provide insights on an individual's external environment including exposure to artificial light, air quality, humidity and noise levels. It\u2019s a first for the wearable space to leverage home health data and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SV33UHFp2q\nUltrahuman Home offers a longitudinal view of environmental markers and their impact on health over time, featuring capabilities like natural light spectrum monitoring, PM detection, noise detection, humidity level monitoring, and blue light exposure monitoring. Set to launch on Kickstarter for USD $349, Ultrahuman Home represents a novel approach to integrating personal and environmental health monitoring.\nMomentum Sport Earbuds\nThe Sennheiser Momentum Sport Earbuds, a result of the collaboration between Polar and Sennheiser, were also introduced at CES 2024. These earbuds combine Sennheiser\u2019s renowned sound quality with Polar\u2019s advanced fitness tracking technologies. They feature a semi-open design, active noise cancellation, and an anti-wind mode, making them ideal for outdoor activities. With an IP55 rating for moisture and dust resistance, they promise up to six hours of battery life.\nUnique to these earbuds is the integration of Polar\u2019s Flow data analytics, which includes a photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor for efficient workout planning. Priced at $329.95, they offer a comprehensive workout experience, combining high-quality audio with sophisticated fitness tracking.\nLike\u00a0this article?\u00a0Subscribe to our monthly newsletter\u00a0and\u00a0never miss out!\nMarko founded Gadgets & Wearables in 2014, having worked for more than 15 years in the City of London\u2019s financial district.

        "raw_content": "LifeSpan made a standing desk bike that can charge your phone, if you've got the legs for it\nDuring a demo at CES 2024, we put a phone on the Qi pad to see how fast we could charge it.\nI've always been curious how easy it is to work while you're using one of those under-desk bikes and, thanks to CES 2024, now I know. My jaunt to Las Vegas has taken me to visit LifeSpan, who was showing off its recently released Ampera standing desk bike. Unlike some desk bikes, Ampera is designed to capture your energy and use it to charge your phone via its 15W Qi charging plate. And, if you feel your legs have more power in them, you can re-juice your laptop via the 65W USB-C port.\nYou don't even need to plug it in, since it operates entirely under its own power, or at least the power it has once you've given it some. The company's official estimates suggest you could get a phone up to 50 percent charge in half an hour. And, if you cycle at speeds over 60 rpm, you'll be able to produce 65 watts per hour, enough to put some decent charge in your laptop or USB battery pack. There's also a companion app which will let you track how much power you've generated, how many calories you've burned and even change the color of the embedded RGB light.\nAnd it's certainly comfortable enough to work from, even in the less-than-ideal conditions of a CES media event. Sitting with my laptop balanced on a tall cocktail table, I was able to maintain a fairly brisk typing speed all the while slowly adding some power to my phone. It's sturdily built and helps you feel planted while you're working out, but mercifully there's also a pair of wheels to help move it around. I could very much imagine having one of these under my standing desk to slide in and out when I don't fancy going out and cycling in the real world.\nThe Ampera Office Bike is available to buy right now from Amazon, normally priced at $999, it's presently on sale for $799.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

        "raw_content": "10 gadgets from CES 2024 that you can buy already\nThere are a lot of \"maybes\" and \"hope tos\" uttered at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), as many of the products demoed there take months or years to launch. And that's if they even make it to market at all; prototypes, previews, and proofs of concept are running themes at the annual tech convention in Las Vegas. But fortunately for anyone eager to get their hands on the latest gadgets, there are a few exceptions every year.\nBelow, we've rounded up a list of products from CES 2024 that are actually available for purchase or preorder immediately, including innovative wearables, stick-on TVs, and a physical manifestation of AI. Some of them blew us away, while others just weirded us out.\n1. Clicks Creator Keyboard Founders Edition\nThe Y2K revival rages on. Featuring a physical backlit keyboard that supports standard shortcuts (like CMD + A for \"Select All\"), this unibody case evoking the Sidekicks and Blackberries of yore is Clicks Technology's debut product. It's available in \"BumbleBee\" (yellow) and \"London Sky\" (gray) for the iPhone 14 Pro, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max.\n2. Garmin Lily 2\nGarmin's latest smartwatch is easily its most fashion-forward wearable to date, with a metal case and patterned lenses that act like stylish screensavers when the display is powered off. It comes with sleep monitoring and built-in sport apps, including a new dance fitness activity that can track different dance styles, and it lasts up to five days on a single charge. The standard Lily 2 comes in two colors with silicone bands, while the slightly pricier Lily 2 Classic (which adds support for Garmin Pay contactless payments) comes in four colors with nylon or leather bands.\n3. Apollo\nRead Mashable's full review of the Apollo.\nApollo Neuro says its new wellness wearable can improve your focus, help you sleep better, and ease your stress with the power of \"good vibes\" \u2014 i.e., by stimulating your vagus nerve (which regulates important bodily functions like heart rate and breathing). It didn't live up to all of those claims when Mashable tech editor Kim Gedeon tried it for three weeks ahead of CES, though it did have a positive effect on her social anxiety: \"It's similar to how I feel when I'm listening to binaural beats or ASMR,\" she wrote. At the time of publication, it was on sale for almost $70 off via Amazon and the Apollo Neuro website.\n4. EVOLVE MVMT\nEvolve MVMT's \"first-of-its-kind\" ankle wearable aims to make your gait more efficient and joint-friendly by tracking the quality (not quantity) of your steps \u2014\u00a0more specifically, the way your heel strikes the ground. If you're a flat-footed person who's \"ever had to pay for expensive orthotics or special footwear, which then has to be replaced every few years, this might be a solid alternative,\" wrote tech reporter Cecily Mauran.\n5. Nimble\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Nimble.\nIn one of the less dystopian examples of \"robots are taking over the world,\" the Nimble is a new 12-inch manicure robot that uses scanning technology and AI to do your nails in about half an hour. \"Since there was high demand to test out Nimble, I was only able to get one nail painted,\" Mauran reported from CES. \"But within minutes, I got polish and a topcoat, and my nail was fully dry. ... Nimble is precise and on par with the pros.\" Its polish capsules will be available in 30 colors, and new features \u2014 including pedicures \u2014 are supposedly in the works.\n6. Displace Flex and Displace Mini\nWatch Mashable staff try the Displace Mini.\nThey're not quite as exciting as LG's new transparent TV, but Displace's new lightweight, wireless 4K displays are still pretty cool in their own right (and certainly more practical): They have battery-powered suction that allows them to stick onto almost any wall or window \u2014 no mounting required. \"It's impossible to pull off unless you actually want to take it off,\" said tech reporter Matt Binder, who took part in a demo at CES. Both the 55-inch Flex model and the 27-inch Mini variant are expected to ship out in late 2024.\n7. Acer Swift Go 14\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Acer Swift Go 14.\nThe new Acer Swift Go 14 looks like a very average laptop until you pull up YouTube, which triggers a set of light-up media controls on its touchpad \u2014 a neat feature for those who use a PC as their primary entertainment device. (Support for other platforms like Twitch and Spotify are expected to be added at launch in March.) The base configuration is powered by a 13th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, but you can upgrade to a newer Intel Core Ultra 5 CPU.\n8. HP Spectre x360 14\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the HP Spectre x360 14.\nHP's newly refreshed convertible boasts next-gen specs (including an Intel Core Ultra processor with AI tools), a 14-inch OLED touchscreen, and a 9MP webcam. But the real star of the show is its clickety-clackety keyboard, which Gedeon called \"the best thing I've ever tested.\" \"I actually contemplated chucking my MacBook Pro out the window for that sweet, sweet typing experience on this irresistible HP laptop,\" she wrote.\n9. Wacom Cintiq Pro tablets\nAvailable in three sizes (17-, 22-, or 27-inch), Wacom's stunning and spacious new drawing slates were the best tablets Mashable saw at CES. Each one sports a vivid 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate and customizable ExpressKeys for different settings and functions. They also come with the new Wacom Pro Pen 3, an ergonomic, pressure-sensitive stylus that \"allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning,\" Gedeon said post-demo.\n10. Wehead GPT Edition\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Wehead GPT Edition.\nThe Wehead puts a literal (emotionless, disembodied) face to OpenAI's large-language model GPT via two screens, and it's as creepy as it sounds. But in its defense, \"it gave some practical advice about surviving CES (stay hydrated, wear comfortable shoes) so there might be some redeemable qualities \u2014 if you're willing to spend $5,000,\" wrote Gedeon and Mauran. If you don't want to curse yourself to a lifetime with this thing, you've also got the option of renting it for $199 per month.\nHonorable mention: Skyted Mask\nAnother CES gadget that toed the fine line between \"wowing\" and \"weirding out,\" the Skyted Muzzle Mask has sound absorption technology that lets you make confidential voice calls when you're out in public. \"[We're] sure some people who are serious about their privacy may find it to be a must-buy for their lifestyle,\" said Gedeon and Mauran. \"However, we can\u2019t see ourselves using this product \u2013 it\u2019s just too outlandish for our tastes.\" Those who fall into the former category can save a serious chunk of cash by backing it on Kickstarter through early February.\nHonorable mention: Stern 'Jaws' pinball machine\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Stern JAWS pinball machine.\nStern's faithful pinball adaptation of the 1975 classic includes that awesome John Williams score, some new voiceover lines from Richard Dreyfuss, and a playfield filled with movie references that's \"immensely fun to look at,\" said tech and games reporter Alex Perry. Now, for the catch (of the day): It appears to be limited to commercial dealers and distributors, and it starts at a whopping $7,000; you can go all the way up to $13,000 for the limited-edition model with different cosmetics. Maybe just wait for it to show up at your local dive bar.\nTopics\nCES\nHaley Henschel is a Chicago-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable who reviews and finds deals on popular tech, from laptops to gaming consoles and VPNs.

So it\u2019s time again for The Barbell\u2018s best of high-tech fitness. Like last year, there are no breakthrough products at this year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show in our wheelhouse of weight-training, but there are some incredible innovations in the wider world of working out and workout recovery. It\u2019s time to geek out. This is The Barbell\u2019s top four products in new fitness tech at CES 2024.\nINBODY LB TRAINER\nThe big data training and nutrition revolution is here. InBody\u2019s LB Trainer is an app and database for personal trainers that simplifies complex tasks, automates time-consuming jobs, and provides a clear vision for training and nutrition. Evaluating exercise posture can be complicated, but it\u2019s simple with LB Trainer\u2019s filming and deep learning. Determining the nutritional stats of a meal can be time-consuming, but with LB Trainer it\u2019s nearly instantaneous. AI predicts body composition changes via a unique body composition dataset of over 100 million global InBody tests (and counting). The app features deep learning tools for trainers to help guide proper exercising and nutrition. InBody\u2019s LB Trainer was an Innovation Award honoree at CES 2024.\nWE-STIM LEGGINGS\nBarunbio Inc.\u2019s WE-STIM (Wearable Electric Stimulation) leggings also won an Innovation Award this year, and talk about innovative! Have you ever thought of generating your own renewable energy via your body to help fuel your body\u2019s recovery? No, we hadn\u2019t either. The WE-STIM leggings harvest natural electric energy generated from body movement, such as running. This energy is then delivered to specific targets on the body using special conductive fibers designed inside the clothing, and this, in turn, rejuvenates muscles in an eco-friendly way without any batteries or wires. The claim is the WE-STIM technology boosts athletic performance, aids in muscle recovery, and minimizes fatigue. The future is here.\nREZET MATTRESS TOPPER\nSmart beds have been around for years. One designed for workout recovery made our CES best-of list last year. But a smart bed is a big expense and commitment, and you can\u2019t take it with you when you travel. Meet Rezet. It\u2019s the first-ever, intelligent, recovery, portable mattress topper. It includes precise postural support via eight internal chambers that automatically adjust to support your ideal spinal alignment throughout the night, smart temperature regulation to maintain your ideal sleep environment, lumbar massage to soothe your back, and a dedicated app that accesses your sleep quality with actionable insights. Rezet uses millions of hours of sleep data (and counting) to provide you the ideal nights of slumber, crucial for overall health and workout recovery. Oh, and it\u2019s a \u201csmart bed\u201d you can take anywhere. The Rezet mattress topper was another CES Innovation Award honoree.\nGARMIN VENU 3 SMARTWATCH\nFinally, we turn to not just another Innovation Award honoree, but the winner of the CES 2024 \u201cBest Of\u201d award in the \u201cSports & Fitness\u201d category: the Garmin Venu 3 GPS smartwatch. It\u2019s like an on-wrist coach. The Venu 3 offers extensive personalized workout and wellness insights, including a \u201cbody battery\u201d that monitors your energy levels and a sleep coach that tracks your slumber. It features a colorful AMOLED display, more than 30 built-in sports apps, and up to 14 days of battery life. With features like a heartbeat monitor, Venu 3 can help users get a more complete picture of their health. Plus, wearers can stay connected at home or on the go with a built-in speaker and microphone to make or take calls or respond to text messages hands-free. The Veru 3 retails for $450.\nSee also the CES Best Fitness Tech for 2020, 2021, and 2023.\nZac Efron Reveals \u201cIron Claw\u201d Training\n2024 Arnold Classic Preview (Updated)\nStrength Training Popularity Surges\nTop Workout Songs of 2023\nRonnie Coleman Health Update\nOzempic Fueling Rise in Gym Memberships\nMuhammad Ali Motivational Quotes\nBiggest Muscle Stories of the Decade\nDifferent Muscle Growth from Different Squat Depths\nHow Strong Was Franco Columbu?\nAlan Ritchson: Workout and Diet Tips\nThe Life of Jenny Lynn-Powell, 2-Time Ms. Figure Olympia (1972-2021)\nFlex Wheeler Talks about Leg Amputation (Updated)\nCES 2020: Best New Fitness Tech\nBest Sources of Protein: The Top 7\nArnold Classic: 10 Things to Know\nThe Very Best Arm Exercises\nBob Paris Workout: Top 10 Training Tips"

But we did notice some genuinely exciting things this year, including the one item almost all of us were talking about: a TV that becomes completely see-through.\nHere\u2019s more about that, and a baker\u2019s dozen other things that we\u2019re looking forward to in 2024:\nA TV you look through\nLG Transparent OLED (LG OLED T, LG OLED Signature T), later this year, price TBD\nLG\u2019s wireless, transparent OLED TV is a fantastical concept that few people will buy\u2014but everyone will want.\nUsing proprietary wireless video technology and some kind of pixel magic that LG didn\u2019t fully explain, the 77-inch 4K transparent OLED TV creates images that seem to float in space.\nFish appear to be swimming in midair. Snow appears to materialize in your living room. When turned off, the TV basically disappears.\nIt also has a rolling contrast screen that can slide up behind it to turn it into a traditional OLED TV.\nIt has no bezel, no wires, nowhere to plug anything in, and\u2014somehow\u2014no discernible heat signature (I reached behind the transparent display, and it was surprisingly cool).\nWhile there is a roughly 1-inch-thick screen suspended in the TV\u2019s housing frame, you can see right through to the wall behind it, though the glass still has a slight sepia tone. The transparent display creates a kind of faux 3D effect while you\u2019re watching, such that the images appear to occupy the full space between the wall at the rear and the front of the screen.\nThough AV fans may argue that the effect dispels traditional cinematic immersion, it\u2019s still an undeniably captivating spin on the usual TV-watching experience.\nLG has stated that the LG OLED T will be available to buy later this year, and though we\u2019ll love to see it show up in department stores and hotel lobbies, it\u2019s not likely to be priced for the average buyer\u2014unless you have tens of thousands to spare for a nearly invisible TV.\nA more comfortable heart-rate monitor\nGarmin HRM-Fit, available now, $150\nGarmin unveiled the HRM-Fit, which attempts to eliminate some of the long-standing discomfort associated with wearing a heart-rate monitor.\nIn the demos we saw, the HRM-Fit clipped to a sports bra, negating the need to wear a band across the entire chest, which we\u2019ve noticed sometimes leads to chafing or irritation with other monitors.\nAside from heart rate, the monitor also tracks steps and calories burned, as well as feedback on your running strides (through the Garmin Connect app). Garmin advertises the HRM-Fit as having a one-year battery life.\nA smart gadget for good boys\nPawport, May 2024, from $450\nThe smart home was ubiquitous at CES, with internet-connected models of nearly any device imaginable on display.\nTopping my list of favorites was the Pawport, a smart pet door that opens and closes automatically when your pet approaches.\nWhat is so appealing to me (note, I don\u2019t even have a pet and am still unreasonably thrilled by this thing) is how thoughtfully the software and hardware were designed. The result is the essence of what makes a \u201csmart\u201d device desirable.\nThe Pawport consists of a pair of powered aluminum doors connected by steel hinges to a steel frame. You screw the frame around an existing pet door and then slide the Pawport down over the frame.\nAround the inside of the doors is rubber weatherstripping that compresses when the doors close to form an airtight seal. The doors are either insulated or have rechargeable, slide-in batteries that last several months between charges.\nOn top is a suite of intuitive touch controls, including open, close, lock, and power.\nThe companion to the doors is a collar fob with a rechargeable battery that sends a Bluetooth signal to the Pawport so that it opens when the pet approaches from inside or outside. It\u2019s also smart enough not to open the door if your pup decides to lie down within range of the door.\nThe Pawport is due in May and will be sold in a range of sizes and finishes\u2014that\u2019s plenty of time for me to convince my wife that a dog is the thing our family is really missing.\nSecurity over the longer range\nAbode Edge Camera, later this year, $200\nOutdoor security cameras should help give you peace of mind, but if Wi-Fi connection issues plague your outdoor cameras, you\u2019ll find no peace.\nAbode\u2019s new answer to that problem\u2014the Abode Edge Camera\u2014replaces traditional Wi-Fi with HaLow wireless technology, which gives it a range of almost 1.5 miles.\nIn addition to long range, HaLow is good at penetrating structures, making this camera suitable for outdoor use while the unit\u2019s wireless hub, which connects to your main network, sits safely indoors.\nThe weatherproof camera includes a 6,000 mAh rechargeable battery, which the company says will power the camera for up to a year.\nThe camera can integrate with Abode\u2019s security systems, including the one we reviewed.\nOther security camera companies have tackled the long-distance Wi-Fi problem by skipping it altogether and including 4G LTE connections in their cameras, but those models require an expensive subscription fee through carriers such as T-Mobile and Verizon.\nAbode\u2019s Edge camera is expected to sell for $200 and requires just a $4-per-month service plan for cloud video storage.\nSimple, (almost) instant smoking\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker, available now, $1,000\nAt CES I saw more grills, smokers, and meat thermometers than in my local Home Depot, but the standout was the countertop GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker.\nSmoking adds distinct flavor to all kinds of foods, but it\u2019s typically done over lower temperatures for long hours, requiring the cook to camp out in the backyard by a hot black metal bin to feed the fire and actively manage the smoke and the temperature. To do it well, in other words, you need passion, time, and skill.\nIf the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker works as billed\u2014the company says you can set it to specific recipes and let it do the work, or you can independently control the heat or smoke level\u2014it can effectively turn smoking into a readily accessible cooking technique for anyone who wants it, just like air frying or sous vide. Imagine popping a few eggplants into a microwave-sized appliance to make killer homemade baba ghanouj on a weeknight, or smoking your own spice blends or chiles whenever the mood strikes.\nI got a sneak peek at this cooker late last year on a research trip to the GE Appliances manufacturing plant in Louisville, Kentucky, where I got to sample some perfectly prepared wings hot out of the box\u2014tender, smoky, sweet, and moist.\nA few more important details: The smoker uses the same pellets as traditional pellet smokers do. It fits 40 wings, a brisket cut in half, or a whole chicken, and it has the same technology to keep the smoke safely inside the appliance and out of your home as the hearth oven made by Monogram, GE Appliances\u2019s luxury brand.\nA simple pocket drone for action selfies\nHoverAir X1, available now, from $350\nDJI has had a death grip on the hobby drone market for the past few years, and for good reason. The image quality, control systems, and autonomous flight modes on the brand\u2019s drones have excelled in our testing, and DJI\u2019s lineup satisfies almost every budget and need.\nThat\u2019s why I was excited to find a tiny, cheap, and potentially uniquely usable drone made by a different company at this year\u2019s CES.\nThe HoverAir X1 is a 4.4-ounce, foldable drone that aims to enable people to capture quick and easy close-up footage. It lacks a dedicated controller, instead focusing on autonomous flight modes and subject-tracking software to follow activities.\nWe\u2019ll be testing this drone against our picks to see if this $350 model ($400 with two extra batteries) can compete with the much more expensive and versatile DJI Mini Pro series. While we don\u2019t think it\u2019ll replace the more expensive cinematic drones, it may be a useful and relatively affordable tool for folks looking to capture simple follow-along footage.\nWash and dry in one laundry machine\nGE Profile UltraFast Combo Washer/Dryer, available now, $2,900\nIn the future, will a combo washer/dryer actually dry your clothes?\nCombo washer/dryers were plentiful at CES this year, and we found the GE Profile UltraFast Combo Washer/Dryer to be the most intriguing.\nTwo-in-one laundry machines aren\u2019t new, but they\u2019re generally less popular. These machines are heat-pump dryers, which use a closed-loop heat system (no vents) to dry clothes at a lower temperature. In practice that has made them less effective at drying clothes.\nDeveloping the UltraFast Combo required years of GE research into heat-pump dryers, which has resulted in patented technology meant to boost the drying process. If this new approach substantially improves drying performance, it could be the beginning of a major change for laundry appliances.\nA ventless machine that requires less space and less time to operate could transform how people do laundry. Even better: Heat-pump dryers use substantially less energy than traditional dryers, and these home appliances qualify for home energy rebates under the Inflation Reduction Act. We\u2019ll be testing this combo washer/dryer, along with several others, later in the year.\nIn-ear translation and out-of-ear sound\nVasco Translator E1, June 2024, $390\nVasco has put its impressive handheld live translator into an earbud format. The Vasco Translator E1 earpiece translates nearly 50 languages in real time (though it still needs to be connected to an app on your phone).\nAnd if the final product works like the demo, its performance will be impressive.\nVasco spent a lot of time working with linguists to address idioms and variations in meaning that direct word-for-word translations don\u2019t consider, which can be crucial to understanding someone in business settings, at medical appointments, or when you\u2019re speaking with local police. The translated text is visible in the app and spoken through the earpiece.\nMagSafe-like wireless charging for Android phones\nBaseus Qi2 Magpro Magnetic Wireless Charging Car Mount, early 2024, price TBD\nBig advancements in charging technology are rare, but a new development in this sphere was hard to miss at this year\u2019s CES: Qi2 (pronounced \u201cchee two\u201d) wireless charging.\nLike Apple\u2019s MagSafe, Qi2 uses rings of magnets to ensure easy alignment between phone and charger, and it allows any compatible device to charge at up to 15 W\u2014twice as fast as the original Qi spec could deliver. Even better, it isn\u2019t proprietary to Apple, so any device that rolls out with a Qi2 certification going forward (maybe the next Pixel?) will be able to take advantage of its faster charging speeds and sturdy magnetic connection.\nOf all the Qi2 chargers we saw on the showroom floor this week\u2014and there were many, from well-known brands like Anker, ESR, and Hyper\u2014we\u2019re most excited about a wireless-charging car mount from Baseus (set to launch in early 2024). Not only does it support Qi2\u2019s 15 W charging speeds, but it also has a small built-in fan to help your phone stay cool. This is handy since wireless chargers in general are prone to overheating, which can damage your device\u2019s battery over time.\nTurntable music that doesn\u2019t have to stop\nVictrola Automatic Turntable, later this year, $200\nWhile some vinyl enthusiasts want turntables that let them tweak every aspect, others, especially those new to the hobby, want something that doesn\u2019t require so much homework\u2014or money.\nThe Victrola Automatic is the latter kind.\nAs a fully automatic turntable, it lowers the tonearm to begin play and raises it at the end. Just place your record down and hit the play button. Victrola also introduced a repeat mode that automatically moves the stylus back to the beginning of the record and plays it again (and again), a useful feature if you\u2019re spinning a favorite.\nThe Victrola Automatic can connect to wired or wireless speakers and includes RCA outputs with a switchable preamp, plus Bluetooth to stream to a pair of wireless speakers, such as the Edifier S1000MKII, our pick for the best powered speakers with Bluetooth.\nComputer monitors go OLED\nAsus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM Monitor, later this year, price TBD\nPC monitors are getting bigger, brighter, and equipped with far more contrast than ever before.\nNearly every PC vendor announced a new 4K OLED monitor at CES, so we expect a lot of competition for our best 4K monitor guide this year.\nMost LCD monitors you\u2019ve seen have a backlight that shines through the TV\u2019s picture, illuminating it to be visible. In OLED technology, each one of the screen\u2019s pixels illuminates itself and can individually turn on or turn off for the most pure black tones.\nFor gamers, this year\u2019s OLED displays are especially eye-catching. The LG UltraGear 32GS95UE, for instance, can switch what\u2019s on the display at 240 Hz, or 240 times per second. That higher refresh rate makes animations and motion on the screen seem more crisp and real. And the 32GS95UE can even boost the refresh rate to a staggering 480 Hz, if it knocks its 4K resolution down to 1080p. For everybody else, OLEDs offer fantastic color accuracy and nearly infinite contrast.\nWe\u2019ll be keeping our eyes out for that LG monitor, as well as Asus\u2019s ROG Swift PG32UCDM, which supports the DolbyVision HDR format.\nAI comes to your laptop\nVarious laptops from many brands, later this year, prices vary\nMicrosoft has dubbed 2024 \u201cthe year of the AI PC.\u201d\nThe addition of the flashy new Copilot shortcut key allows even quicker access to your PC\u2019s AI capabilities. It also marks the first major change to the Windows keyboard in nearly three decades.\nBut the more significant change is under the hood. This year\u2019s newest PCs with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra processors have NPUs, or neural processing units, that run machine-learning processes locally. As a result, these tasks can run faster, can use less battery life, and can be more secure than sending them off to the cloud.\nSome notable examples of laptops with these processors include new versions of our top ultrabook picks that are available now\u2014the HP Spectre x360 14, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED (UX3405), and the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12\u2014as well as a fleet of other premium laptops shipping in the coming months.\nRight now, AI PC features are limited\u2014the prime example is Windows Studio effects, which use AI for video-conferencing features such as background blur and noise cancellation. But now that NPUs are available in a big way from Intel and AMD, many laptop and software companies are building apps and features that take advantage of them.\nFor example, you\u2019ll be able to use a conversational interface for navigating and changing settings on your PC without having to dig through labyrinthine menus, or ask for a summary of a meeting transcript. We expect to see these AI PC features evolve over the coming years.\nPC gaming handhelds are here to stay, and Intel is getting involved\nMSI Claw A1M, later this year, price TBD\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since Valve and AMD brought handheld PC gaming to the masses with the Linux-based Steam Deck, and 2023 saw Asus and Lenovo join in with the Windows-based ROG Ally Extreme and Legion Go, respectively.\nBut MSI\u2019s new partnership with Intel for its upcoming Claw gaming handheld\u2014announced at CES and featuring a Meteor Lake\u2013based system-on-a-chip\u2014is the clearest indication yet that the major players in PC gaming are taking these devices more seriously than ever.\nMSI\u2019s Claw borrows heavily from the ROG Ally Extreme. It has a similar form, down to the programmable buttons on the back of each side grip and the function buttons on either side of its 1080p, variable-refresh-rate display. But the differences are obvious as well.\nThe rear of the Claw features a heavily vented design that MSI claims will help with heat dissipation, and MSI has stressed that the included 53 Wh battery should give two hours of battery life on its maximum performance settings, beating out the ROG Ally Extreme and even Lenovo\u2019s Legion Go.\nMSI will still have its work cut out for it against bigger players, and we have good reason to wonder how Intel\u2019s new hardware will fare compared with AMD\u2019s more mature graphics tech. We don\u2019t know how much effective battery life the Claw will have in real-world scenarios, or how easily it will manage different power profiles.\nAt CES, MSI was using October\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage to demonstrate the Claw\u2019s capabilities, but it wasn\u2019t running especially well, and the system-management software was sluggish and poorly organized.\nThe Claw is likely a couple of months away still, and every one of these mainstream gaming handhelds has launched in rough shape\u2014it was months before the ROG Ally Extreme felt stable, the Legion Go is still a work in progress, and the recent Steam Deck OLED model has seen dozens of beta updates since its November launch. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the Claw comes together in February or March.\nRegardless, Intel\u2019s entry into the market is a clear indication that it thinks the demand for this kind of device is only going to grow, and after spending time with all of them, I\u2019m inclined to agree.\nFaceTime calls made easy\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit, later this year, $180\nBelkin\u2019s newest device is a motorized, auto-tracking iPhone dock that enables your phone camera to follow your face\u2014not only around the frame, but 360 degrees around. What this means: FaceTime calls and video recordings can follow you totally hands-free.\nBecause the dock uses Apple\u2019s DockKit API, you don\u2019t have to install an app to set it up. Pairing the dock with your iPhone takes seconds\u2014and the tracking is really good.\nOnce you place your iPhone on the dock\u2019s base, the Stand Pro instantly connects to it via NFC (near-field communication, the same technology that lets you make contactless mobile payments), and it uses Bluetooth to maintain its connection.\nYou can\u00a0activate or deactivate the tracking with the push of a single button, and the stand comes equipped with a screw port in case you want to attach it to a tripod, too. The Stand Pro also charges your iPhone via 15 W MagSafe charging, and the dock itself offers five-hour battery life when unplugged. We were impressed by the demo and can\u2019t wait to test the dock once it\u2019s available.\nThis article was edited by Jason Chen and Ben Frumin.\nMeet your guide\nWirecutter Staff\nFurther reading\nThe Best of CES 2022: What We\u2019re Most Looking Forward To\nby Wirecutter Staff\nWirecutter\u2019s expert staff found a few things to look forward to from CES 2022, including a smarter faucet and a projector that doubles as a portable speaker.\nThe Best Electric Vehicle Chargers for Home\nby Sarah Witman\nAfter 28 hours of research and 85 hours of testing, we found the best ways to charge your J1772 (non-Tesla) or Tesla electric vehicle at home.\nWhat We\u2019re Looking Forward To From CES 2019\nby Wirecutter Staff\nWirecutter reporters and editors spent three days working overtime at CES 2019 to find the new stuff that might actually improve your life this year.\nThe Best of CES 2023: What We\u2019re Looking Forward to Most\nby Wirecutter Staff\nA smarter water faucet, an excellent wireless speaker, and a cleaning genie were among our favorite things from CES 2023.\nWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

In similar news, read on for\u00a0futuristic concepts, products you can\u00a0already buy today\u00a0and our best of show picks\u00a0for 2024.\nA smart ring with a new edge\nThere's a new smart ring in town: the Evie health tracker. Made by Movano, it won CNET's admiration at CES this year, earning a spot in our best of show. In a world of smartwatches and wearables, what sets Evie apart is that it was designed with women's health in mind, from the fit of the ring itself to the way it interprets data in a holistic way. For more on the Evie ring -- including how comfortable it was to wear, how it tracked steps and more -- check out Bridget Carey's hands-on test of Evie on the CES floor.\nThe Evie ring and app are currently only compatible with iOS, with plans to support Android in the near future. You can order one now for $269 (in gold, rose gold or silver colors) with shipments expected later this month. Unlike Oura ring, there is no monthly subscription for an Evie ring -- just the one-time payment.\nAn all-in-one thermometer, stethoscope and heart health checker\nBeamO is a four-in-one health-scanning device.\nThe BeamO from Withings is a Wii-looking thermometer that does it all -- takes your temperature, checks your heart rate and blood oxygen levels, and even works as a stethoscope.\nDesigned to be easy to carry and light to hold, the BeamO is entering the market post-pandemic, where telemedicine visits are still the norm. But increasingly, patients want quick access to basic health information that providers may normally collect in-office.\nBeamO could help anyone who wants easy insights into their heart and lung health (and temperature, of course) monitor their baselines and share information with their health care providers. Following expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nGlasses that let you hear better\nThe Nuance Audio glasses can amplify the voice of the person you're speaking to.\nThe Nuance Audio glasses from EssilorLuxottica were made for people with mild or moderate hearing loss -- those who notice they have some trouble hearing in noisy, busy places. They have technology built right into the glasses frames that will amplify sound. To adjust the volume, users can tweak the glasses themselves or use the companion app. You'll also be able to add your vision prescription to the lenses.\nA pair of Nuance Audio specs will provide a different way for people to improve their hearing. Even now that the FDA is allowing over-the-counter hearing aid sales so people can get a hearing aid without a prescription,\u00a0high cost and perceived stigma of wearing hearing aids are still barriers to treatment for many people. (There's no official word on how much the Nuance Audio glasses will cost yet.)\nNuance Audio glasses are expected to be available in late 2024 in the US. They aren't a replacement for hearing aids, but EssilorLuxottica is registering them with the FDA as an over-the-counter hearing device.\nRead more: This Smart Bed Adjusts to Your Body With AI Sensors and Strings\nAn air conditioner for your neck\nA personal air conditioner that travels with you.\nTorras, which makes wearable air conditioners for your neck, announced a new model of its personal air condition at CES this year, the Coolify Cyber. While it's not a new concept this year (there are other models available for sale), it's the company's latest version of an air conditioning product that fits around the back of your neck to keep you cool -- not a bad choice for a hot day walking around, and one of the more approachable wellness items.\nIt works by running an electrical current between a semiconductor and a ceramic cooling plate that sits on your neck. CNET's Nick Wolny had a chance to test out the Torras' neck air conditioner, describing it as a positive experience that was \"a blast of cold air, but like a neck pillow that energized me.\"\nA toothbrush that tells you when you're doing it wrong\nThis year at CES, the Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush made its debut as a smart toothbrush that uses bone-conduction technology and an AI voice guide to give you tips on your brushing technique, including whether you're brushing too hard or focusing too much time in one part of your mouth. It has five brush modes designed for specific needs or times of the day and an interactive touch screen that can tell you where you missed a spot. The Oclean X Ultra will launch in the US this fall and costs $130.\nCES 2024: Kitchen Tech and Cooking Tools That Caused the Biggest Stir\nImproved diabetes tech\nA mold of the Mobi, Tandem's tiny automated delivery system.\nThe big diabetes device companies had a presence at CES this year, showcasing the latest improvements in technology for people with Type 1 diabetes. Last summer, Tandem\u00a0announced FDA clearance\u00a0of its Mobi insulin pump, the world's smallest automated insulin delivery system. And at the 2024 CES, the company brought it in for a showcase ahead of its anticipated launch early this year.\nAbbott and Tandem also just announced a US integration of Abbott's newest continuous glucose monitor, the\u00a0FreestyleLibre 2 Plus Sensor, with Tandem's T:slim X2 insulin pump.\nAt launch, the Mobi will be compatible with the Dexcom G6 sensor, with Dexcom G7 and Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor compatibility anticipated to follow, according to a press release.\nNew at-home smart UTI test\nVivoo's at-home urine tests pair with an app.\nUrinary tract infections (known as\u00a0UTIs) are a common reason for a trip to the doctor.\u00a0Vivoo, a health tech company that makes at-home urine tests with a partnered app, announced a new UTI test that gives users quick results that are stored on an app.\nVivoo said in a press release it's able to give UTI results through its \"deep learning image processing technology\" through its software.\nTo use it, download the Vivoo app first. Then, pee on the strip and scan it to get results on the app. Because it's stored on an app, you can easily share results with a health care provider to get a prescription or treatment.\nAt-home urine strips (even for UTIs) aren't new to DIY health care, but having a test available to people in partial app form can be useful for those who want more privacy or people who want to narrow down the cause of their symptoms. It also follows in the footsteps of other pee-based CES tech, like last year's toilet sensor from Withings.\nRead more: Anti-Snore Pillows at CES: This Smart Pillow Senses When You're Sawing Logs\nA wearable that's supposed to track your focus and agility\nThe Pison Ready wristband\nWe're all used to companies boasting their health-tracking and fitness-monitoring features, but what about how clear-headed and mentally sharp you're feeling? This year at CES, makers of the Pison Ready claim they can track just that.\nThe Pison Ready is made to measure metrics of mental focus, reaction time and agility through tests taken on your wrist, as demonstrated by CNET's Lisa Eadicicco. Pison Technology says it can zone in on your mental alertness by detecting neurological signals from the brain that suggest mental acuity. The company initially based its neural biosensing technology to benefit amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.\nThe Pison Ready launches in February and will be available as a subscription -- three months for $59, a year for $119 and two years for $199. It's not clear right now how practical it'll be for most people -- or how accurately it shows people's real-time ability to stay focused -- but the availability of a wearable that measures more heady wellness metrics, as opposed to more strict health metrics like blood oxygen or sleep stages, could potentially be an advancement in the wellness bubble in 2024.\nRead on for some of the wackiest tech at CES this year,\u00a0which robots we saw there, and the\u00a0most cutting-edge tech for 2024.\nOther Wellness Guides\nPersonal Care\nSleep\nFitness\nNutrition\nMedical and Mental Health"

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too.

Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line.

It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels. It has a 1000R curvature, 7680 x 2160 4K resolution with up to 120Hz for smooth motion and action when gaming, while it has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits.

The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is perfect for larger rooms and homes.Roborock has it priced starting at $1,800 with an expected release date sometime in spring 2024.\nXgimi Horizon Max Projector\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is an IMAX Enhanced-certified projector, which means it fits the criteria for the resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio from IMAX at home. This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. It has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode, so you can have different settings for different walls in your home. So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action.

It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

Why Trust Us?\nThe 2024 edition of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) \u2014 one of the biggest annual consumer tech industry events \u2014 wraps today. Virtually countless new products debuted at the show over the past four days, and they ranged from computers and TVs to various home appliances and small gadget accessories. CES has always been a venue for brands to display concepts and ultra-premium offerings. (Take, this year, the stunning and transparent LG Signature OLED T TV.) But among the outstanding design and engineering, the most noteworthy trend this year was AI making its way into more and more of our tech.\nThe products at this year\u2019s trade show proved that in the years ahead, artificial intelligence will do a lot more than just help with productivity. AI will also enable a TV to deliver pristine picture quality, tune a speaker for optimal sound, and even make sure a meal is perfectly cooked, to name just a few tasks. AI-powered tech in everyday appliances looks bound to become a norm in the years ahead as well, if you\u2019re looking to give someone or yourself the gift of an extra pair of (virtual) hands around the house.\nAs we do every year, we spent days tuning in to product briefings and combing through press releases and spec sheets to handpick the best new gadgets that debuted at CES 2024. We focused on products that will actually go on sale and have the potential to make their way into consumers\u2019 daily routines in the weeks and months ahead. (There can be a lot of vaporware at the show, after all.)\nWe broke down the most exciting products that captured our attention into the following major categories: Entertainment & Audio, Computers & Accessories, Mobile Gadgets, Home & Appliances, and Family. Since most of these products are not available for purchase just yet, be sure to come back in the months ahead to learn more about these gadgets once we\u2019ve had hands-on experience with them.\nEntertainment & Audio\nThe TCL QM8 was our favorite TV of 2023, and its 2024 sequel is even more exciting. The latest iteration of the 4K TV brings a quantum dot mini LED panel with more local dimming zones for superior contrast and a peak brightness of a whopping 5,000 nits. That translates to double the brightness of the 2023 model, ensuring the 2024 TCL QM8 will deliver striking visuals even in brightly lit spaces.\nThe 4K TV will become available to order in the months ahead. We don\u2019t know the pricing details yet, but given TCL\u2019s track record, we expect it will be super reasonable. The tech giant also unveiled a TV with a stunning 115-inch mini LED screen \u2014 the largest of its kind.\n\u2014 Stefan Vazharov, Senior Technology Editor, Reviews\nIn addition to delivering a sleek design, comfy fit, and the iconic brand's signature sound and top-tier noise cancellation, the Momentum Sport true wireless earbuds by Sennheiser pack heart rate and temperature sensors for next-level activity and wellness tracking. The sensors' readings can integrate with the user's preferred health- and fitness-tracking platforms like Apple Health, Garmin Connect, Strava, and Peloton, to name a few.\nThe sweat- and water-resistant earbuds will become available to order in April for $329.99. There will be three colors to choose from: burned olive, polar black, and metallic graphite.\n\u2014 SV\nJBL\u2019s Live 670NC and Live 770NC wireless headphones are our favorite to arrive at CES 2024. Like their excellent predecessors, the newcomers deliver a mixture of elegant design, high-quality sound with spatial audio capabilities, reliable noise cancellation, and superb battery life, all at an agreeable price. The Live 670NC cans have an on-ear fit, while the 770NC has a traditional over-ear layout.\nThe latest JBL headphones will hit the shelves in March. The Live 770NC and Live 670NC will cost $199.95 and $129.95, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Samsung Music Frame, like the legendary TV with the same, is a tech product that can effortlessly blend into any home decor via customizable covers. Equipped with Samsung Q-Symphony tech, the speaker will sync perfectly with its maker\u2019s TVs and soundbars for an immersive surround sound experience.\nDetails about the pricing and retail availability of the Samsung Music Frame have yet to be made available, but we don't expect the wait to be too long.\n\u2014 SV\nThe JBL Xtreme 4 is a sequel to one of our favorite waterproof Bluetooth speakers and an instant best-in-class contender. The gadget is capable of blasting AI-enhanced sound that\u2019s customizable via an app and up to 30 hours of audio playback between power-ups. Its replaceable battery pack sets it apart from all rivals.\nWe like that JBL manufactured the speaker using 70% recycled plastic and 100% reclaimed fabric. The Xtreme 4 will hit the shelves this June in several colors with a $379.95 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nThe EarFun Wave Pro wireless headphones are the audio maker's first and a rock-solid contender for the best budget set in the game. Like the brand's stellar wireless earbuds, the over-ear cans offer an appealing combination of sleek design, customizable sound with support for Hi-Res Audio, and strong noise cancellation. To top things off, the headphones can rather impressively deliver 80 hours of wireless playback between charges.\nSales of the EarFun Wave Pro headphones will begin this spring. The headphones will cost $79.99 \u2014 an incredible design given their design, specs, and onboard features.\n\u2014 SV\nComputers & Accessories\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo is an exciting new addition to the PC laptop realm not only for its striking dual-screen design but also for its affordable price. The notebook will start below $1,500 when it becomes available to order this spring. Combined with its versatile design and high-end specs, the price makes a serious case for choosing the new ZenBook Duo over a premium touchscreen laptop with a conventional form factor.\nHardware-wise, the ZenBook Duo features a pair of high-resolution OLED touchscreens with a high refresh rate and a cutting-edge Intel Core chip with Arc graphics. Of course, the product will be bundled with a Bluetooth keyboard with an integrated trackpad.\n\u2014 SV\nHP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 gaming laptop impressed us by delivering top-tier hardware specs \u2014 an Intel Core Ultra chip, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics, a high-performance OLED display panel, and a rich set of connectivity features \u2014 in a compact and elegant package that weighs just a feather above 3.5 pounds. That\u2019s on par with the weight of a 14-inch MacBook Pro, making the Omen Transcend 14 incredibly lightweight and portable for a high-performance PC gaming rig.\nThe versatile Omen Transcend 14 is already available to pre-order from HP with a $1,500 starting price. That\u2019s quite a bargain, especially considering its striking design and futureproof specs.\n\u2014 SV\nThe detachable keyboard on Lenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid made it our favorite Android tablet of CES 2024. Because it features a full-blown PC with an Intel chip and Windows 11 on board, it gives you two devices (a laptop and a tablet) wrapped into one \u2014 not just a feature-rich tablet with a bundled keyboard.\nRemarkably, the two components can work together or separately, depending on your needs. The product will hit the shelves in the spring with a hefty $1,999 price tag.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 4K gaming monitor by Samsung deserves your attention for being great at, well, everything \u2014 from high-performance gameplay to delivering your favorite streaming content with incredible picture quality via the tech giant\u2019s smart platform. Combined with a minimalist design, the product\u2019s 32-inch display panel with millions of individually backlit pixels and antireflective finish makes it a great upgrade option for work and play.\nSamsung also equipped the monitor with a SmartThings Hub for controlling connected home gadgets. An ultra-wide Odyssey OLED G9 monitor with a curved 49-inch screen debuted as well for those who need to replace two screens.\n\u2014 SV\nNVIDIA launched the GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs during CES. The latest-generation graphics cards pack dedicated cores for AI processing, ensuring the cutting-edge tech will take the users\u2019 experience \u2014 from heavy workloads to in-game visuals \u2014 to a whole new level. The latest components deliver a significant performance bump over their top-shelf GeForce RTX 30 series predecessors.\nPricing of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs will start at a reasonable $599 for an RTX 4070 Super version. The range-topping RTX 4080 SUPER, dubbed a \u201c4K monster\u201d by its maker, will cost $999.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Razer Aetner monitor light bar is a handy desktop accessory that will give your work and gaming sessions a bright, colorful upgrade. The attachable dual light consists of an adjustable white strip and a back-facing row of color LEDs that are customizable via the excellent Razer Chroma RGB suite. The white light will illuminate your workspace, while the colorful backlight is a must for gaming.\nWe like that the Razer Aetner is compatible with the Matter smart home standard and that its LED lights have a lifetime of 25,000 hours.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Clutch Tanto Mini Xbox controller by HyperX \u2014 the maker of our favorite budget gamepad \u2014 stands out with an incredibly compact design. Its compact footprint is tailor-made for younger gamers. I tip my hat to HyperX for creating the product, as I still remember how unwieldy the three-button Sega Genesis controller was back in the early 1990s.\nThe tiny gamepad has a standard Xbox layout and a built-in audio jack. It will launch this spring with an attractive $39.99 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nDo you have a teenage gamer that's very amenable to bribery? RCA\u2019s new gaming monitor might just do the trick to get them to agree to study. My son, the gamer of our house, watched the press release and was blown away by the \u201cdamn fast\u201d 240Hz refresh rate, the 2-millisecond input lag, 1 millisecond GtG response time, cool swiveling features, USB-C 90W charging and DisplayPort Alt-Mode, and \u201csick backlighting.\u201d\nThe whole thing is on a pivot stand and seamlessly switches between PS5, computer, Xbox, or any other platform you choose to use it for. Personally, I\u2019m hoping some English homework makes it on the monitor between bouts of GTA. RCA is new to gaming monitors, but being the grandad of the electronics industry gives them a great leg-up, and we\u2019re excited to see more innovations like this from the brand in the future.\n\u2014 Cat Bowen, Senior Editor, Reviews\nMobile Gadgets\nOtterBox launched a lineup of elegant and sustainable iPhone cases made from sustainable cactus-based leather. Dubbed Desserto, the leather-like material is stylish, great to interact with, and, crucially, eco-friendly. The accessory giant also unveiled a MagSafe wallet and an Apple Watch band from the same material.\nThe MagSafe-compatible case will become available in several colors this spring for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro family. It will cost $59.99, while the MagSafe wallet and the Apple Watch band will go for $49.99 and $39.99, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nZagg launched a version of the iconic mophie juice pack battery case for the latest iPhones during CES 2024. A synonym for iPhone backup power for well over a decade, the nifty gadget will significantly extend the charging independence of the Apple smartphone while keeping it pocket-friendly. It will be available for iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nYou'll be able to pre-order the mophie juice pack in late February for $99.99, which will come with a robust two-year warranty.\n\u2014 SV\nBelkin's Stand Pro is not just yet another sleek MagSafe iPhone stand from the well-known accessory maker. Thanks to support for Apple's DockKit standard, the motorized accessory offers 360-degree movement tracking. This means that whether users are on a video call or capturing content for social media, they will always be perfectly framed.\nThe accessory has a button for enabling and disabling tracking. Of course, it also doubles as a fast MagSafe charger. You will be able to snag one in the months ahead for $179.99.\n\u2014 SV\nHome & Appliances\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight is a noteworthy, low-key addition to the maker\u2019s excellent lineup of lighting fixtures that were showcased at CES 2024. In a manner befitting its name, the smart home product consists of light panels that are flush-mountable on a ceiling. It\u2019s easily expandable and adaptable to any space and usage scenario.\nLike all Nanoleaf products, the Skylight can glow with millions of customizable colors and shades of white. It\u2019s controllable via an app or through voice commands from your preferred virtual assistant.\n\u2014 SV\nLG\u2019s latest Styler is a home appliance that will make the chore of storing and maintaining your favorite clothes in perfect condition a breeze. Thanks to a high-tech Moving Hanger system and an available Fine Dust cycle, the Styler will remove dust particles. What\u2019s more, the product\u2019s integrated high-pressure steamer can remove wrinkles and sanitize clothes.\nOther key Styler features include a room dehumidification functionality and a ventilation system. Pricing and availability details are yet to be revealed.\n\u2014 SV\nThe eufy X10 Pro Omni robot vacuum impressed us by offering a ton of desirable features at a price point that\u2019s well below $1,000. The versatile cleaning robot can vacuum and mop floors with the help of its sophisticated navigation setup feature. Better yet, it can empty its bin, refill its water container, and even clean and dry its mopping pads by docking into its Omni station.\nAnker will begin offering the eufy X10Pro Omni in February for $799.99. That\u2019s considerably less than big-name rivals with comparable features.\n\u2014 SV\nThis Wi-Fi-equipped smart deadbolt by Philips will replace your keys or smartphone with your palm. The convenient gadget has a sophisticated palm reader, which will unlock it by scanning your hand\u2019s vein patterns. The latter are unique for everyone, guaranteeing that only authorized users can unlock it.\nUnsurprisingly, the Philips deadbolt is also compatible with virtual assistant voice commands, allowing you to control it or keep tabs on its status. The product will be available to buy in the coming months for $359.99.\n\u2014 SV\nFamily\nWith the BeamO multiscope, Withings treated us to the best health and wellness gadget of CES 2024. The device sets a new standard for wellness monitoring by merging a contactless thermometer, a digital stethoscope, an ECG, and an oximeter in a sleek package that\u2019s easy to use at home or anywhere else.\nGetting the readings will take about a minute, and users will be able to share the results with their doctor via a sleek companion app. The BeamO will become available to order this summer for $249.95.\n\u2014 SV\nMasimo\u2019s monitoring technology is used in over 10 million hospitals worldwide, and now they\u2019re bringing their powerful tech to parents with the first FDA-approved-for-prescription wearable baby monitor. Utilizing a sock/boot style device, it monitors your baby\u2019s heart rate and oxygen if your baby has rolled over, as well as their temperature, alerting parents if anything is outside normal limits. It can be used when your baby is asleep and awake for continuous monitoring if your baby requires that.The Stork Baby Wearable Monitor can also share your baby\u2019s data with their health providers. For parents of medically fragile children, this little device could help bring a lot of peace, and because it\u2019s by-prescription, insurance may cover it.\nThe non-prescription version is sold at major retailers, and it also includes a high-resolution video camera along with all of the monitoring available in the prescription monitor.\u2014 CB\nMaxi Cosi is one of our favorite baby brands at Best Products. They\u2019re known for their high-quality, innovative, affordable baby products, and as of CES 2024, they've entered into the electronics space. With the See Pro 360\u00ba Baby Monitor, they\u2019re taking their affordable and innovative reputation and applying it to a very pricey realm.The See Pro 360\u00ba is a combination of a handheld monitor and camera and a smartphone monitor, giving parents choices of how to view their baby. Like last year\u2019s debut, the Q-Bear, this monitor uses CryAssist technology not only to detect when your baby\u2019s crying but also to translate the sounds to determine if your baby is sleepy, hungry, wet, or just plain cranky.\nIt has everything you\u2019d expect in a modern monitor: two-way talking, temperature and humidity sensors, a high-definition camera with clear color, night vision, and a long battery life on the monitor itself. It\u2019s doing this all for just $199.\u2014 CB\nThe Owlet is not new to the wearable baby monitor game, but they\u2019ve recently stepped up their game, and they\u2019re showing it off at CES. Like Masimo, they\u2019re offering an FDA-cleared-for-prescription wearable baby monitor for parents of babies with a need for clinical monitoring outside of the clinical setting. The Owlet offers something unique from Masimo in that your child\u2019s pediatrician can set the parameters for the alerts sent to them and the parents.\nThe BabySat measures oxygen levels, heart rate, and levels of motion. Stats are easily viewable through Owlet\u2019s straightforward app. Like their original sock, it\u2019s a wireless monitoring device designed to stay put on your baby\u2019s foot all night (and day) long.\u2014 CB\nTikiSmart just finished a wildly successful crowd-funding campaign, and now they\u2019re showcasing their kid-safety system at CES. TikiSmart is a first-of-its-kind whole-home child monitoring device. It\u2019s a wearable device that tracks when your child gets near something dangerous, like if they\u2019re submerged in water or if they fall suddenly.The system includes a receiver, bracelets, and monitoring tags. You use the tags to determine danger areas, and if your child approaches it while wearing the monitoring bracelet, it alerts your phone and speaks the alert aloud over the receiver.\nYou can also buy a \u201crepeater\u201d that extends the coverage much in the same way a wifi extender extends your wifi coverage. The TikiSmart is bound to get a lot of buzz, likely both negative and positive, but for parents with family pools, a pond, or even a fire pit, the allure will likely be hard to resist.\u2014 CB\nThe Toniebox is one of the best storytelling devices, in our opinion, and they\u2019re coming out with some fantastic new characters that they\u2019re debuting at CES.Sara Llama is the Yoga Tonie, and she\u2019ll guide your child through four stories, each with a theme central to yoga, like friendship and confidence. There\u2019s Juniper, the potty training Tonie that uses stories to help your child prepare for potty training. And finally, there\u2019s Mo, the mindfulness Tonie that walks your child through mindful activities through his stories.\u2014 CB\nStefan is the senior technology editor for Best Products, where he\u2019s been covering the tech industry and testing the latest gadgets since 2015.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!

Our goal is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more by bringing Copilot, the everyday AI companion, to millions of people around the world. We have reached another milestone in this mission with more than 5 billion chats and more than 5 billion images to date. As Copilot continues to earn preference and usage, we\u2019re receiving valuable feedback on how to improve. Two examples: First, there are a set of Copilot power users like creators, researchers, programmers and others who want more rapid access to the very latest we have to offer. And second, our Microsoft 365 customers want access to Copilot in the Microsoft 365 apps for personal use.\nTo help address those needs, today we\u2019re delighted to announce more options for power users, creators and anyone looking to take their Copilot experience to the next level. This begins with the introduction of Copilot Pro, a new premium subscription for individuals that provides a higher tier of service for AI capabilities, brings Copilot AI capabilities to Microsoft 365 Personal and Family subscribers, and new capabilities, such as the ability to create Copilot GPTs. We are also announcing the general availability of our Copilot app for iOS and Android phones. Finally, we\u2019re excited to bring Copilot for Microsoft 365 to more commercial customers by expanding the availability to businesses of all sizes, including small- and medium-sized businesses, starting today.\nIntroducing Copilot Pro: Supercharge your creativity and productivity\nToday we\u2019re announcing the availability of Copilot Pro, a new subscription that delivers the most advanced features and capabilities of Microsoft Copilot to individuals looking to supercharge their Copilot experience.

Copilot for Microsoft 365 became generally available for enterprises in November. As we said earlier this year, 40% of the Fortune 100 participated in our Early Access Program, and since GA for enterprise, customers like Visa, BP, Honda, Pfizer, and partners like Accenture, KPMG and PwC are already using Copilot \u2014 which means thousands of people across industries and sectors have started working in new ways, with an AI-powered copilot at their side. Today we are excited to announce that Copilot for Microsoft 365 is now available for organizations of all sizes \u2014 with no seat minimum. We are also enabling our partners to help every business become AI-powered.\nToday\u2019s updates include:\nCopilot for Microsoft 365 is even more powerful for organizations because it works across your entire universe of data at work \u2014 including emails, meetings, chats, documents and more, plus the web. With natural language prompts like \u201cTell my team how we updated the product strategy,\u201d Copilot can generate a status update based on the morning\u2019s meetings, emails and chat threads. Copilot is also integrated into the apps millions of people use every day, including Microsoft Teams (which is not available with Copilot Pro). Copilot jump-starts your creativity in Word, analyzes data in Excel, designs presentations in PowerPoint, triages your Outlook inbox, summarizes meetings in Teams \u2013 whether you attended or not \u2013 and so much more. Backed by enterprise-grade security, privacy, and compliance, and Microsoft\u2019s Customer Copyright Commitment, we can\u2019t wait to see how businesses of all sizes achieve more using AI. Learn more on the Microsoft 365 blog.\nIntroducing new features in Copilot\nAs we expand the availability of Copilot to even more people, we continue to offer a great free experience for anyone interested in exploring how Copilot can transform productivity and creativity using AI. Today we\u2019re excited to share additional updates to Copilot. You can get started by visiting copilot.microsoft.com.\nWith today\u2019s announcements, we continue to bring Copilot to more customers with more options that work for them.

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.
