        "raw_content": "Top Picks 2024: Nexstar Media Group (NXST)\nNexstar Media Group (NXST) is a leading diversified media company that produces and distributes local and national news, sports, and entertainment content across its television and digital platforms, including more than 300,000 hours of programming produced annually by its business units, highlights Doug Gerlach, editor of Dividend Informer.\nIt owns America\u2019s largest local broadcast group comprised of top network affiliates. Nexstar\u2019s national television properties include The CW, NewsNation, and a 31.3% ownership stake in TV Food Network.\nNexstar Media Group is also the largest owner of local television stations in the US. The company owns, operates, programs, or provides services to 200 television stations reaching 212 million people covering approximately 68% of US television households. The company\u2019s station portfolio is primarily comprised of network affiliates of ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, and The CW.\nThese network relationships give the company the exclusive right to broadcast primetime network content in its markets in exchange for affiliation fees. The networks retain the right to sell most of the advertising time during network broadcasts, though Nexstar is typically allocated some slots as well.\nIn addition to network content, Nexstar\u2019s stations air programs the company produces itself, such as local news, as well as syndicated programs its stations acquire. The company receives the advertising revenue from non-network programming.\nNexstar\u2019s business model is focused on free cash flow generation, allowing for generous capital return to shareholders. Free cash flow faced headwinds in 2023 because it was an off-cycle year for political advertising and the company was absorbing costs related to its acquisition of majority control of The CW.\nHowever, Nexstar should remain a substantial cash generator. The company has guided to average annual free cash flow of approximately $1.05-$1.15 billion over the 2023/2024 political cycle versus a current market capitalization of under $5 billion.\nThe company\u2019s strong cash generation has afforded it plenty of flexibility in capital return. Over the past twelve months, Nexstar generated over $1 billion in free cash flow. During that time, the company reduced its share count by more than 10%. Historically the company has been an aggressive repurchaser of its own shares, reducing its share count by more than 25% since the end of 2019.\nCurrent dividend payments account for just under $200 million annually, resulting in a healthy 3.7% dividend yield recently. Debt reduction has also been a part of the company\u2019s playbook, though its current net debt/EBITDA is 3.4x, at the low end of its target leverage range of mid-to-high 3x.\nSubscribe to Dividend Informer here\u2026\nUpcoming Events\nFebruary 21 - 23, 2024\nThe Best Money & Trading Ideas in 2024\nTop Pros\u2019 Top Picks (Daily)\nSubscribe to MoneyShow\u2019s daily investment newsletter Top Pros' Top Picks and get actionable advice from our top experts, including the hottest stocks to buy and sell, ETFs and funds for short- and long-term capital appreciation, and a wide variety of dividend-paying stocks set to deliver a steady stream of safe, reliable income.\nTrading Insights (Daily)\nGet an edge on the markets with our daily trading newsletter, Trading Insights, and receive timely trade ideas covering stocks, options, futures, and more to keep you on the right side of the action.

(NASDAQ: NXST), today announced the launch of \u201cThe NEXT Series,\u201d a collection of exclusive symposiums designed to bring together thought leaders and influential voices to examine critical issues related to media, content, and advertising.\nThe series kicks off with \u201cThe Power of News: Growing Brands and Serving Communities,\u201d a groundbreaking symposium that underscores the vital relationships between media, brands, and journalism. \u00a0The inaugural symposium will explore the important connection between unbiased news and influential brands, and how advertising during news broadcasts can enhance brand reputation.\u00a0 Presented in collaboration with Ad Fontes Media, the event will take place at New York City\u2019s Paley Center for Media on Tuesday, November 14, and will feature a distinguished gathering of journalists and media executives as panelists and guest speakers.\nFeatured speakers include: Pulitzer Prize-Winning journalist & Sr. Political Contributor, George Will; Television journalist and host of CUOMO, Chris Cuomo; Cherie Grzech, SVP of News and Managing Editor of Nexstar\u2019s national cable news network, NewsNation; Bob Cusack, Editor-in-Chief, The Hill; Rod Carter, Evening News Anchor, WNCN-TV/CBS 17 in Raleigh, NC; Vanessa Otero, Founder and CEO, Ad Fontes Media; Author, Rishad Tobaccowala (\u201cRestoring the Soul of Business: Staying Human in the Age of Data\u201d); and Entrepreneur, Journalist, and Best Selling Author, John Battelle (Founder of Wired magazine). A full list of the participants, along with their profiles and the agenda can be found on The NEXT Series (https://thenextseries.nexstar.tv/) event page.\n\u201cWe are excited to bring this distinguished group together to examine the critical roles that news, advertising, and brand-building play in creating and sustaining an informed citizenry,\u201d said Michael Strober, Nexstar\u2019s Chief Revenue Officer.\u00a0 \u201cAs the nation\u2019s largest owner of local television stations, with news being delivered across our 200 owned or partner stations and two leading national news platforms \u2014 The Hill and NewsNation \u2014 we believe it is our responsibility to elevate the conversation about the importance of supporting news and journalism. \u00a0It is our hope that this symposium will demonstrate the enduring value of connecting television news audiences with the country\u2019s leading advertisers.\u201d\n\u201cNews of world and political events is top of mind for everyone right now, and that focus and attention on news is only going to increase throughout the upcoming election year,\u201d said Ms. Otero. \u201cNow is the time for brands to step off the sidelines and invest in high-quality news, and not\u00a0just\u00a0because it is the right thing to do for journalism, democracy, and civil society. They should invest because it is truly one of the most lucrative advertising opportunities in recent memory due to a confluence of factors. The premium audiences are there, they are demanding reliable information and paying attention to it, and news inventory has been systematically undervalued in the past eight to ten years. Brands attending this symposium will truly understand these factors and be putting themselves ahead of the pack in the coming year.\u201d\nNexstar will host additional symposiums throughout 2024 that will highlight an array of topical issues and explore the challenges faced within the brand and media community. Future events will explore topics such as \u201cSports and Social Good,\u201d designed to address how sports and social responsibility impact brands, and \u201cJournalism and AI,\u201d which will examine how AI is affecting integrity in journalism and how broadcasters are protecting the validity of authentic news content and ensuring its credibility.\nAbout Ad Fontes Media\nAd Fontes Media is the media bias intelligence leader and producer of The Media Bias Chart\u00ae which rates media sources in terms of political bias and reliability. The company was founded by patent attorney Vanessa Otero with the mission of rating all the news to positively impact the media ecosystem. In 2021, Ad Fontes Media launched its flagship Ad Fontes Data Platform, a family of integrated media bias intelligence solutions. The Data Platform allows Ad Fontes Media\u2019s brand, media, and media technology partners to leverage its comprehensive news source ratings so they can engage with them in real-time in media planning.\nAbout Nexstar Media Group, Inc.\nNexstar Media Group, Inc.
