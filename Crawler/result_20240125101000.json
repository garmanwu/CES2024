        "raw_content": "The Best Car And Technology Reveals From CES 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show is more important than ever in the automotive realm.\nCES 2024 has just wrapped up in Las Vegas with a strong showing from automakers and automotive-related tech companies. More than just concepts, these displays preview what will soon be a reality in the cars we drive, which is why we've selected 10 technologies and vehicles revealed at this year's event that will impact the automotive realm.\nOnce again, manufacturers and suppliers brought their A-game. These are our favorite car and technology reveals from CES 2024. We didn't pick these randomly, either; all of these represent technology that will reach the mainstream sooner than you know.\nWhat Is CES And Why Does Matter?\nAutomotive manufacturers and technology producers used to stick to their own lanes, but the line between the two is becoming increasingly blurry. That's why the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has become a popular platform for automakers and suppliers to showcase new automotive technology, and CES 2024 was a hotbed for automotive innovation.\nA decade ago, the most advanced piece of technology in a car was the infotainment system, but we now live in the era of permanently connected vehicles. And let's not forget about electric cars, which run on platforms that have allowed engineers and designers to explore and push through existing automotive boundaries.\n1. Facial Recognition\nContinental Automotive showcased its new Face Authentication Display, which uses biometric recognition to identify the owner and anyone authorized to use whatever car. There are cameras mounted in the B-pillar and instrument cluster. You walk up, and the car recognizes you, unlocks, and activates. And before you ask, the answer is no. You can't access the vehicle using a photograph or mask.\nThe humble car key was good enough for a hundred years, but Mercedes-Benz changed the game when it introduced the W220 S-Class Sedan in 1999. It was the first car equipped with a key that sent out a unique frequency, which unlocked the vehicle as the driver. Nowadays, it's a common piece of tech, and automakers constantly try to outdo each other with new smartphone-based key technology.\nFacial recognition is already widely used in the smartphone industry, and it's only a matter of time before it filters down into cars. This tech could also help detect inebriation, preventing you from driving drunk.\n2. Hyundai Mobis Mobion\nThe Mobion is a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with unique bumpers and lights, but that's not why it's here. It's here because it showcases what's possible when you mount an electric motor within each of the four wheels. Since the wheels are self-contained units, they can rotate individually within the wheel well.\nHyundai Mobis (the automaker's technology arm) used the Mobion to demonstrate Pivot Turn, Diagonal Drive, Zero Turn, and Reverse Drive. It's the most agile car we've ever seen in action, and a system like this will make parking in congested cities like Los Angeles a joy.\n3. BMW's Augmented Reality Glasses\nBMW brought many of its latest gadgets to CES, but the one that stood out was the wearable XREAL Air 2 augmented reality glasses.\nInstead of projecting information on a head-up display, these glasses will force the real and digital realms to unite fantastically. You put them on, and you'll see navigation and hazard information, points of interest, and even entertainment content. The theory is that the world around you can be presented in a new light, and we imagine rod closures, accidents, and even things like potholes can be made visible long before you arrive on the scene. Plus, points of interest like restaurants can be highlighted, and we'd imagine the tech can be extended to allow passengers (particularly children) to play games by interacting with the world around them.\n4. Harman Ready Vision QVUE & AR HUD\nHarman came to CES prepared with several creations OEMs will be studying carefully in the coming months. We're big fans of Ready Vision QVUE and the innovative head-up display. The scalable technology can be easily applied to affordable EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox and high-end luxury barges like the Cadillac Escalade IQ, as the technology can utilize a small area or become a full-width HUD.\nReady Vision projects valuable information on the lower part of the windscreen, and it can utilize augmented reality to project navigation over the road in front of you to enhance the HUD experience. Owners can also install third-party apps from the Harman Ignite Store, adding to the information on display with things like charge states, 3D navigation, and real-time traffic, and you could even order take-out.\n5. VinFast VF 3\nVinFast got off to a rocky start in the USA, but that didn't stop the automaker from introducing the VF 3 at CES.\nWe didn't get many details about the tiny electric SUV, but VinFast provided the most important number: a projected starting price of under $20,000. VinFast is also setting up shop in the USA, which means the VF 3 could potentially qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit.\nApply that, and you get a starting price of $12,500. The estimated range may only be 125 miles, but that low price will be mighty attractive to people who don't travel long distances.\nIf a tiny crossover isn't your thing, the Vietnamese brand also revealed a pickup truck concept called the VF Wild, inspired by superhero costumes.\n6. Kia Platform Beyond Vehicle Solutions\nKia introduced five concept vehicles at CES 2024, showcasing the future of electric commercial vehicles. The PV1, PV5, and PV7 were all designed to be robust, modular, and clever tools. They're boxy by design and boast a weldless body structure that can accommodate interchangeable upper bodies.\nWe'll use the PV5 as an example. During the day, it can be used as a last-mile delivery vehicle. After its shift is done, the owner can put the minivan-like body on top and send it out to serve as a taxi.\n7. Mercedes-Benz And Amazon Music\nMercedes-Benz announced a collaboration with Audible and Amazon Music. The new E-Class and CLE will be the first models to benefit from this partnership, and both features will be rolled out in Q3 this year.\nWhy does this matter? If you're an audiophile, you'll know that Amazon Music with Dolby Atmos was introduced last year. Basically, the sound quality is so good that you feel immersed in it rather than listening to it. In reality, you'll be stuck in traffic but feel like you're in the golden circle at a Pearl Jam concert.\nThis was just one of several pieces of tech the German automaker brought, including a new AI virtual assistant bound for the new CLA-Class and a collaboration with will.i.am that creates music based on your driving inputs.\n8. Volkswagen Golf GTI And ChatGPT\nVolkswagen announced that it will implement ChatGPT into its upcoming infotainment systems, starting with the Mk8.5 Golf GTI, making the voice assistant more powerful. Cerence Chat Pro will back VW's system and will be capable of so much more than turning the temperature up by a few degrees.\nAccording to VW, this will benefit all occupants. You can answer the car questions or converse with it when alone.\nWe're on the fence about this one. On the one hand, having a Golf GTI as a friend would be cool. Conversely, we've seen Her and how prone people are to fall in love with an AI system. Plus, our social battery gets depleted from interacting with people and recharged by driving, so why would we want to detract from our happy place by being forced to converse with it to get basic functions done?\n9. Lamborghini Digital Driver Coach\nWhen it comes to supercars, there's one universal truth. Driving talent doesn't increase in correlation with the size of your wallet. In short, you may have $500,000 to splurge on a Lamborghini Revuelto, but that doesn't mean you have the talent to exploit its capabilities.\nThat's what Lamborghini wants to fix with Telemetry X. This system can send recordings of on-track performance and telemetry to a driving coach who will provide live feedback. It won't make you a Formula 1 ace, but you'll be able to get the most out of the Revuelto's 1,000 horses. It can also tap into your biometrics to provide enhanced coaching, and the virtual assistant will give you feedback as you drive, telling you if you're faster or slower of if your brakes are overheating. It's like having your own version of Gianpiero Lambiase in the car with you.\n10. Zeekr 007\nThe owners of the James Bond IP probably won't allow the Zeekr 007 to go into production sporting that name, but that's not important right now. The fact that Zeekr chose the Las Vegas-based CES to showcase one of its models is a grand statement of intent. The 007 isn't new (it was revealed at the end of December 2023), but this surely means Zeekr wants to become the first Chinese manufacturer to do business in the USA.\nThe Chinese-spec model has a dual-motor setup that produces 636 horsepower and a range of 540 miles. Is that enough to get people out of their Teslas? How will the market respond to a Chinese-built vehicle, especially since the government has made no secret that it does not want China to send its product here?"

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "Cars That Talk, Dance and Fly: The Best Car Tech at CES 2024\nElectric car concept debuts, wild new motion technologies and the rise of AI on the road defined car technology at the first and largest tech show of the year.\nThe Honda 0 Saloon is easily the best looking concept at CES and, according to Honda , it'll hit the road in 2026.\nCES 2024 once again proved that the biggest technology show of the year is also now the biggest car show. Taking a step back, the biggest trends in car technology can be broken down into three areas: electrification, new ways to move and the arrival of language-based artificial intelligence in the dashboard.\nAI hits the road\nAutomakers have been working to bring artificial intelligence to the car for over a decade. (Autonomous driving tech, for example, is powered by AI.) However, at CES 2024, the advancements in large language model AI that's taken the internet by storm is arriving in the dashboard to make talking to your car for voice command and assistance more, for lack of a better term, human.\nThe German automakers have been the fastest to make announcements in this space. Volkswagen announced a partnership with Cerence to bring ChatGPT to its \"Hello Ida\" voice assistant system as a free, cloud-based update for drivers of its ID 4 and ID 7 electric cars later this year. BMW paired up with Amazon for its Alexa Large Language Model, while Mercedes-Benz is working with Azure OpenAI. From parts and software suppliers to SoC manufacturers, everyone everywhere was talking about AI in the car.\nSoon, rather than memorizing commands like \"Navigation\" or \"Send an SMS,\" you may be able to ask your car to \"Find a taqueria nearby with good burritos and EV charging nearby, send that to my wife with a text that says 'meet me there,' and then start guidance,\" and the car will just make it work.\nNo, it's not a car, but the Supernal S-A2's debut is proof that automakers like Hyundai are still rethinking how we'll move around cities in the very near future.\nNew EV concepts\nThere weren't as many EV concept debuts as you might expect from mainstream automakers -- those tend to be spread out over the year at more focused events -- but the few we did get were \ud83d\udc68\u200d\ud83c\udf73 chef's kiss.\nAfter joining Sony onstage to update us on the Sony Honda Mobility Afeela EV concept, Honda woke up bright and early on day 2 to pull back the curtain on its two 0 Series EV concepts. The Honda 0 Space-Hub is a spacious, futuristic minivan that transforms the interior into a hub where passengers can interact with each other beneath its massive transparent roof. Its sulky sibling, the Honda 0 Saloon is a low-slung sports coupe with dramatic gull-wing doors. Honda says the Saloon will serve as the basis for a production EV arriving in 2026; let's hope it still looks this good when it gets here.\nMeanwhile, Kia showcased the evolution of its purpose-built vehicle concepts with a trio of Purpose Beyond Vehicle concepts. The PV1, PV5 and PV7 now look more like conventional vans rather than weird autonomous pods and are built around a modular platform and Lego-like accessory system. Kia envisions a future where these PBVs will be infinitely customizable, serving as food trucks, mobile pop-up shops, delivery vans and, of course, cute little minivans.\nMovement in all directions\nHyundai's parts supplier arm Hyundai Mobis wowed showgoers with the Mobion concept, which danced and twirled around on its e-Corner steering system. With highly articulated, independent steering enabling up to 90 degrees of steering angle for all four wheels, the Mobion concept is able to \"crab drive\" laterally into a parallel parking space, glide diagonally through tight spaces and perform 360-degree, zero radius turns on the spot. Plus, it can pull these maneuvers off on pavement versus the tire-scrubbing tank turn systems demoed on a few electric pickups, which only work on dirt.\nThe Korean full-court press of CES continued with Hyundai's advanced air mobility wing showcasing the second generation of its electric vertical take-off and landing aircraft, the S-A2 eVTOL. After a bit of a slow start -- Hyundai's first S-A1 electric air taxi was initially projected to start flights in 2023 -- Supernal says the five-seat, battery-powered craft will be quietly taking off from urban helipads and blasting over traffic at 120 mph and 1,500 feet as early as 2028."

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Roundup: Automotive Highlights from the World's Largest Tech Show\nSummary\nRelated Articles\nSummary\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas is where some of the biggest tech news of the year is announced. More than 4,000 exhibitors are at the show this year, with cutting-edge tech covering nearly every area imaginable. It\u2019s the cars we\u2019re interested in, though, and there were plenty of announcements from automakers ranging from new audio systems to entirely new models. Here are the automotive highlights of CES 2024.\nGoogle Built-In\nGoogle announced updates to Android Auto that would add real-time EV range information to Google Maps. The feature will launch with the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, showing you the estimated battery level at arrival, suggesting charge stops, and estimating charging times along the way. Volvo EVs and some GM EVs already have this feature, and it\u2019s very helpful because it helps curb range anxiety. It adds predictability, offers more choice, and lets you select your route based on your charge without relying on the car\u2019s built-in navigation system.\nGoogle Built-In, the operating system used by Volvo and GM, among others, is adding the Chrome web browser (for use when parked). The system also adds The Weather Channel app to show you the weather along your route.\nHonda EV Concepts\nHonda brought two concept cars to debut what it calls the Honda 0 (Zero) Series, a new line of EVs that will launch in 2026. \u201cThe mobility we dream of is not an extension of the trend of \u2018thick, heavy, but smart\u2019 EVs,\u201d said Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda. \u201cWe will create a completely new value from zero based on thin, light and wise as the foundation for our new Honda 0 EV series to further advance the joy and freedom of mobility to the next level.\u201d\nThe concept above with the rectangular nose and gullwing doors is called the Saloon. Its stance is low and wide. Honda says a vehicle based on this concept will arrive in 2026, and it marks not just a new era for Honda electrification, but its styling is nothing like what we've seen from the brand so far.\nThe chunkier concept is called the Space-Hub. Honda didn\u2019t mention if we\u2019d see something in production based on this one, but it might preview what an Odyssey minivan might look like in the future.\nHonda 0 Series models will get the company\u2019s most advanced autonomous driving features. They will also have new e-Axles that the company says will deliver high levels of power and efficiency, along with a battery that Honda says will not degrade more than 10 per cent after 10 years of use.\nHyundai All-In on Hydrogen\nHyundai presented its vision for hydrogen-powered vehicles including passenger vehicles and heavy trucks going forward. The brand remains heavily invested in the tech and plans to develop new large-scale green hydrogen production solutions. It is also concentrating on tech that can deliver hydrogen for vehicles from organic waste (including manure) as well as from melting waste plastics.\nThe company said it expects to have vehicles using 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, enough to drive a passenger vehicle 3 billion km. For reference, passenger vehicle traffic in Canada is approximately 333 billion km per year.\nKia Shows Electric Vans\nKia brought a series of concepts for a future commercial electric van. The Platform Beyond Vehicle concepts offer innovative features like vehicle bodies that can be removed and swapped out quickly. Kia suggests that you could use the van for a taxi by day, a delivery van by night, and a camper on the weekend. Kia emphasized software in the concepts, with the goal of improved charge management and better fleet management. The first planned for production is the PV5, the second largest of the four, built at a new plant capable of handling 150,000 units per year.\nLamborghini Performance Biometrics\nThe Lamborghini Telemetry X concept is in-car tech meant to make you a better driver on track. It captures your biometric data for performance monitoring to help you train off the track and monitors your lap times, lines, and pedal performance to help make you faster. Lamborghini says the system offers proactive voice assistance in the vehicle to help you brake and turn at the right spot.\nMercedes Debuts New Infotainment System\nMercedes-Benz announced that its new MB.OS system, first announced two years ago, will make it into vehicles soon. It will offer an AI virtual assistant that Benz says will \u201ccreate an even more natural and intuitive relationship with the car.\u201d The company says the system will allow more natural interaction with the car\u2019s voice command system. It will also include enhanced 3D graphics for the navigation system that can show the driver hazards around the road. More apps will be added, including games, streaming, and even food-ordering apps.\nIn collaboration with Amazon Music and Audible, Benz will add Dolby Atmos to its Burmester audio systems. Benz says Atmos audio, used in movie theatres to provide a more immersive experience, should do the same for in-car listeners. \u201cImmersive audio storytelling enables our customers to benefit fully from the advanced sound technology in our vehicles. For us, unparalleled in-car entertainment is a further dimension of the hyper-personalized user experience,\u201d said Mercedes-Benz CTO Markus Sch\u00e4fer.\nVinFast Shows Cute EV and Wild Pickup Concept\nElectric startup VinFast Auto brought a pair of concepts including the minicar VF 3 and the VF wild pickup concept.\nThe VF 3 is on sale now in Vietnam and is making its debut for the rest of the world \u2013 though there are no details on Canadian availability. It\u2019s small, about half a metre shorter than a Mitsubishi Mirage, and offers an estimated 202 km of range, which isn\u2019t bad considering the $15k price tag in its home country.\nVinFast\u2019s first pickup, the VF Wild, is likely to be much more relevant to Canadians if it makes it to market. The Wild is about the size of a Honda Ridgeline, but powered by electricity. It offers a flexible bed with a midgate (the new EV pickup hot ticket) that lets you extend the bed by using the back seats of the cab, and it has clamshell doors like the best early 2000s trucks.
