        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "The Best Car And Technology Reveals From CES 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show is more important than ever in the automotive realm.\nCES 2024 has just wrapped up in Las Vegas with a strong showing from automakers and automotive-related tech companies. More than just concepts, these displays preview what will soon be a reality in the cars we drive, which is why we've selected 10 technologies and vehicles revealed at this year's event that will impact the automotive realm.\nOnce again, manufacturers and suppliers brought their A-game. These are our favorite car and technology reveals from CES 2024. We didn't pick these randomly, either; all of these represent technology that will reach the mainstream sooner than you know.\nWhat Is CES And Why Does Matter?\nAutomotive manufacturers and technology producers used to stick to their own lanes, but the line between the two is becoming increasingly blurry. That's why the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has become a popular platform for automakers and suppliers to showcase new automotive technology, and CES 2024 was a hotbed for automotive innovation.\nA decade ago, the most advanced piece of technology in a car was the infotainment system, but we now live in the era of permanently connected vehicles. And let's not forget about electric cars, which run on platforms that have allowed engineers and designers to explore and push through existing automotive boundaries.\n1. Facial Recognition\nContinental Automotive showcased its new Face Authentication Display, which uses biometric recognition to identify the owner and anyone authorized to use whatever car. There are cameras mounted in the B-pillar and instrument cluster. You walk up, and the car recognizes you, unlocks, and activates. And before you ask, the answer is no. You can't access the vehicle using a photograph or mask.\nThe humble car key was good enough for a hundred years, but Mercedes-Benz changed the game when it introduced the W220 S-Class Sedan in 1999. It was the first car equipped with a key that sent out a unique frequency, which unlocked the vehicle as the driver. Nowadays, it's a common piece of tech, and automakers constantly try to outdo each other with new smartphone-based key technology.\nFacial recognition is already widely used in the smartphone industry, and it's only a matter of time before it filters down into cars. This tech could also help detect inebriation, preventing you from driving drunk.\n2. Hyundai Mobis Mobion\nThe Mobion is a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with unique bumpers and lights, but that's not why it's here. It's here because it showcases what's possible when you mount an electric motor within each of the four wheels. Since the wheels are self-contained units, they can rotate individually within the wheel well.\nHyundai Mobis (the automaker's technology arm) used the Mobion to demonstrate Pivot Turn, Diagonal Drive, Zero Turn, and Reverse Drive. It's the most agile car we've ever seen in action, and a system like this will make parking in congested cities like Los Angeles a joy.\n3. BMW's Augmented Reality Glasses\nBMW brought many of its latest gadgets to CES, but the one that stood out was the wearable XREAL Air 2 augmented reality glasses.\nInstead of projecting information on a head-up display, these glasses will force the real and digital realms to unite fantastically. You put them on, and you'll see navigation and hazard information, points of interest, and even entertainment content. The theory is that the world around you can be presented in a new light, and we imagine rod closures, accidents, and even things like potholes can be made visible long before you arrive on the scene. Plus, points of interest like restaurants can be highlighted, and we'd imagine the tech can be extended to allow passengers (particularly children) to play games by interacting with the world around them.\n4. Harman Ready Vision QVUE & AR HUD\nHarman came to CES prepared with several creations OEMs will be studying carefully in the coming months. We're big fans of Ready Vision QVUE and the innovative head-up display. The scalable technology can be easily applied to affordable EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox and high-end luxury barges like the Cadillac Escalade IQ, as the technology can utilize a small area or become a full-width HUD.\nReady Vision projects valuable information on the lower part of the windscreen, and it can utilize augmented reality to project navigation over the road in front of you to enhance the HUD experience. Owners can also install third-party apps from the Harman Ignite Store, adding to the information on display with things like charge states, 3D navigation, and real-time traffic, and you could even order take-out.\n5. VinFast VF 3\nVinFast got off to a rocky start in the USA, but that didn't stop the automaker from introducing the VF 3 at CES.\nWe didn't get many details about the tiny electric SUV, but VinFast provided the most important number: a projected starting price of under $20,000. VinFast is also setting up shop in the USA, which means the VF 3 could potentially qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit.\nApply that, and you get a starting price of $12,500. The estimated range may only be 125 miles, but that low price will be mighty attractive to people who don't travel long distances.\nIf a tiny crossover isn't your thing, the Vietnamese brand also revealed a pickup truck concept called the VF Wild, inspired by superhero costumes.\n6. Kia Platform Beyond Vehicle Solutions\nKia introduced five concept vehicles at CES 2024, showcasing the future of electric commercial vehicles. The PV1, PV5, and PV7 were all designed to be robust, modular, and clever tools. They're boxy by design and boast a weldless body structure that can accommodate interchangeable upper bodies.\nWe'll use the PV5 as an example. During the day, it can be used as a last-mile delivery vehicle. After its shift is done, the owner can put the minivan-like body on top and send it out to serve as a taxi.\n7. Mercedes-Benz And Amazon Music\nMercedes-Benz announced a collaboration with Audible and Amazon Music. The new E-Class and CLE will be the first models to benefit from this partnership, and both features will be rolled out in Q3 this year.\nWhy does this matter? If you're an audiophile, you'll know that Amazon Music with Dolby Atmos was introduced last year. Basically, the sound quality is so good that you feel immersed in it rather than listening to it. In reality, you'll be stuck in traffic but feel like you're in the golden circle at a Pearl Jam concert.\nThis was just one of several pieces of tech the German automaker brought, including a new AI virtual assistant bound for the new CLA-Class and a collaboration with will.i.am that creates music based on your driving inputs.\n8. Volkswagen Golf GTI And ChatGPT\nVolkswagen announced that it will implement ChatGPT into its upcoming infotainment systems, starting with the Mk8.5 Golf GTI, making the voice assistant more powerful. Cerence Chat Pro will back VW's system and will be capable of so much more than turning the temperature up by a few degrees.\nAccording to VW, this will benefit all occupants. You can answer the car questions or converse with it when alone.\nWe're on the fence about this one. On the one hand, having a Golf GTI as a friend would be cool. Conversely, we've seen Her and how prone people are to fall in love with an AI system. Plus, our social battery gets depleted from interacting with people and recharged by driving, so why would we want to detract from our happy place by being forced to converse with it to get basic functions done?\n9. Lamborghini Digital Driver Coach\nWhen it comes to supercars, there's one universal truth. Driving talent doesn't increase in correlation with the size of your wallet. In short, you may have $500,000 to splurge on a Lamborghini Revuelto, but that doesn't mean you have the talent to exploit its capabilities.\nThat's what Lamborghini wants to fix with Telemetry X. This system can send recordings of on-track performance and telemetry to a driving coach who will provide live feedback. It won't make you a Formula 1 ace, but you'll be able to get the most out of the Revuelto's 1,000 horses. It can also tap into your biometrics to provide enhanced coaching, and the virtual assistant will give you feedback as you drive, telling you if you're faster or slower of if your brakes are overheating. It's like having your own version of Gianpiero Lambiase in the car with you.\n10. Zeekr 007\nThe owners of the James Bond IP probably won't allow the Zeekr 007 to go into production sporting that name, but that's not important right now. The fact that Zeekr chose the Las Vegas-based CES to showcase one of its models is a grand statement of intent. The 007 isn't new (it was revealed at the end of December 2023), but this surely means Zeekr wants to become the first Chinese manufacturer to do business in the USA.\nThe Chinese-spec model has a dual-motor setup that produces 636 horsepower and a range of 540 miles. Is that enough to get people out of their Teslas? How will the market respond to a Chinese-built vehicle, especially since the government has made no secret that it does not want China to send its product here?"

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "2024 CES show report: all the latest cars revealed\nThe first motor show of 2024 isn\u2019t even a motor show at all. CES\u00a0in Las Vegas, rebranded since its days as the Consumer Electronics Show as part of a wider tech push beyond televisions and mobile phones, has long since been embraced by the car industry looking to position itself at the cutting-edge of the societal change that the rise of electrification is bringing.\nEven just within the hall into which the car industry is squeezed, CES can make your head spin - in both its size and what you\u2019re actually being shown. It isn't so much an assault on your senses, rather something that makes you question your own sense of reality. Radars, sensors, cameras and software can be tricky things to demonstrate and make sound exciting. Generative artificial intelligence (AI)\u00a0being installed into your car just sounds plain scary.\nYet there were still big cars and big car stories to digest at CES. The biggest new car headline came from Honda, which revealed its most interesting and exciting car in a long time: the 0 Series Saloon, a far more exciting project than the name suggests. It\u2019s a wedge-shaped saloon that\u2019s almost DeLorean-esque in its silhouette\u00a0and is the first model of a series of Hondas made with engagement at their heart. This is not a bland, rational model made by the numbers.\nRelated articles\nBut perhaps the most interesting story came from Kia, which laid out its plans to enter the commercial vehicle sector in 2025 with the PV5, the first in a series of new vans - sorry, PBVs - that it will launch over the next decade. Commercial vehicles bigger and smaller will follow, including passenger versions, in a development that shows the growth of Kia shows no signs of slowing down.\nThat was the headline for the Hyundai Motor Group from CES, at least of the four-wheeled kind. Its flying car division Supernal revealed its S-A2, a vision for a world where you effectively take Uber to the skies. Road relevance came from it using batteries and motors from Hyundai\u2019s electric cars but more so from being designed by the group design boss Luc Donckerwolke.\n\u201cThe great thing about CES is it\u2019s not just a commercial show with a goal to sell new products,\u201d he told me about why they chose it to reveal such a radical departure from\u00a0Hyundai.\u00a0\u201cYou\u2019re talking about a window into the future. CES is an innovation show, giving perspective to what we\u2019re doing and what the environment will be. We\u2019re not just looking at cars and competition, it\u2019s about questioning your ability to design and the fitness of your company for the future. This is what I enjoy: going from automotive world to innovative world into the future.\u201d\nDonckerwolke\u2019s words clearly weren\u2019t ringing in Volkswagen\u2019s ears when it decided to bring a camouflaged version of the upcoming facelifted eighth-generation Golf. Still, the German firm did get into the spirit of things by installing AI software ChatGPT into a\u00a0Golf. Quite what use that would be on the road isn\u2019t clear.\nView all car reviews\nBMW and Mercedes-Benz\u00a0had a presence at CES, too, the latter adding increasingly more features to its infotainment software and the former largely the same with the added development of some augmented-reality glasses that you can wear while driving to see things like navigation commands projected into your field of vision ahead. It\u2019s clever stuff, yet BMW\u2019s assertion that such glasses will be as ubiquitous as smartphones in the future felt a bit of a leap. Google Glass, anyone?\nOther automotive brands at CES included Vinfast, which brought an electric pick-up truck concept, and Xpeng, which read the CES room more by creating a six-wheeled off-roader that can also fly \u2013\u00a0obviously.\nYet many of the bigger stories at CES lie in those sensors and operating systems, from the likes of Mobileye and Luminar. Their work isn't glamorous but provides the technology that allows for developments, particularly in autonomous driving, that are\u00a0of far greater significance than whether a car ever takes to the air.\nThe world of automotive is changing, massively and quickly, and nowhere more so is that clear than at CES.\nAfeela saloon concept\nSony and Honda's joint venture presented an updated version of its Afeela saloon concept, revealing minor styling tweaks. The side-view cameras have been replaced with conventional mirrors, for example, and the front and rear ends have been tweaked to give a more angular look. Technical specifications were also confirmed, with the EV hosting a 241bhp motor on each axle\u00a0and a 91kWh battery capable of recharging at rates of up to 150kW.\nThe production car will also benefit from a number of high-profile partnerships from the world of technology. Polyphony Digital, developer of the Gran Turismo video games, will provide its expertise with simulations to help develop the car, while Microsoft's OpenAI service will underpin the on-board digital assistant.\nHonda 0 Series concepts\nHonda has completely rethought its approach to EV development with a new pair of concepts. Efficiency, engagement and practicality are the priorities for its next generation of global models, which are promised to arrive in Europe in 2026.\nTo that end, each 0 Series EV will sit on a brand-new 'thin' platform, allowing them to sit lower - and therefore provide better aerodynamic performance \u2013 than existing skateboard architectures.\nThe Saloon, promised to be 90% ready for production, will be the first to arrive. However,\u00a0it will lose some of its more outlandish features, such as the gullwing doors.\nThe Space Hub MPV hasn't yet been green-lit for production but will inform a smaller, similarly conceived SUV.\nEverything we know about the Honda 0 Series\u00a0EVs\nKia\u00a0electric vans\nKia will expand into the world of vans in 2025, launching the PV5 as a rival to the Ford Transit Custom and Volkswagen Transporter. Based on an adapted version of the E-GMP architecture, which underpins the Hyundai Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6, it's highly configurable. Kia displayed MPV, high-roof and pick-up variants of the PV5. A\u00a0larger PV7 is also on the cards, but\u00a0the other two delivery vehicles previewed at CES \u2013\u00a0the PV1 and PV3 \u2013\u00a0aren't yet planned for production.\nEverything we know about Kia's\u00a0new electric vans\nMullen Five RS\nNascent American EV firm Mullen unveiled a rival for the Tesla Model X Plaid, claiming a power output north of 1000bhp and a top speed of 200mph. The Five RS is said to feature a dual-motor, four-wheel-drive powertrain, 800V electricals and six- and four-piston Brembo brakes.\nEverything we know about the Mullen Five RS\nSupernal S-A2\nHyundai's aircraft division, Supernal, unveiled its vision of an eVTOL (electric\u00a0vertical take-off and landing) aircraft. Billed as an alternative form of taxi in dense cities, it's planned to enter production in 2028.\nEverything we know about the Supernal S-A2\nVolkswagen Golf Mk8.5\nVolkswagen unveiled the interior of its updated Mk8 Golf, which has been tweaked in response to the criticisms it faced from buyers and the press alike. Physical buttons return to the steering wheel\u00a0and the infotainment touchscreen from the ID 3 facelift and new ID 7 has been grafted onto the dashboard to improve the user experience \u2013 including by adding backlighting for the heater controls.\nEverything we know about the Mk8.5 Volkswagen Golf\nXpeng AeroHT Land Aircraft Carrier\nChinese EV firm Xpeng's aviation arm, AeroHT, confirmed it will begin production of its Land Aircraft Carrier this year. It's effectively two vehicles in one:\u00a0a six-wheeled electric van that hosts an electric helicopter.\nXpeng is targeting volumes of around 10,000 Land Aircraft Carriers per year in China alone\u00a0but is yet to enter discussions with Western authorities over homologating the flying \"air module\".\nEverything we know about the Xpeng AeroHT Land Aircraft Carrier\nAdditional reporting by Charlie Martin\nMark Tisshaw\nMark is a journalist with more than a decade of top-level experience in the automotive industry.

Supernal is a part of the Hyundai Motor Group. (AP Photo/John Locher, File)\nCES provides an annual insight into where and how cutting-edge innovations will reshape how people work, study, communicate and, in many cases, how they\u2019ll drive. This year CES saw a number of automakers present concept vehicles that seem both years into the future and on the very cusp of production.\nFrom flying vehicles and AI-powered voice assistants to the latest in EVs, CES 2024 offers a peek into what you\u2019ll be driving \u2014 or what might be driving you \u2014 in the years ahead. The automotive experts at Edmunds have rounded up some of this year\u2019s most notable automotive debuts.\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMES TO YOUR CAR\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is poised to reshape countless aspects of daily life. While there are plenty of concerns and opportunities involved, it\u2019s clear that automakers will be moving ahead to use AI for what they hope will be a more helpful and optimistic driving future.\nMercedes-Benz, for its part, debuted its next-generation AI virtual assistant software. The upcoming version of Mercedes\u2019 MBUX infotainment interface, dubbed MB.OS, will feature conversational voice commands and far more nuanced responses. For example, by monitoring voice instructions and driving behavior, the AI system can determine if a driver is hurried and stressed or cruising along carefree. A version of MB.OS is set to debut in Mercedes\u2019 upcoming electric-powered CLA sedan.\nAnother German automaker, Volkswagen, says it will integrate ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot, into its vehicles to provide more voice interaction beyond what\u2019s currently available. For example, the car\u2019s existing voice command features will work for things like navigation, climate control or general knowledge requests. But something it can\u2019t handle will be forwarded anonymously to ChatGPT. ChatGPT will then respond in a seamless Volkswagen voice and style. For now, Volkswagen has not said when this functionality will be available on its vehicles sold in the United States.\nHONDA\u2019S HEADED BACK TO THE FUTURE\nReliable, efficient and out-of-this-world wild. Which one of these descriptors is not often attributed to the practically minded Honda Motor Co.? In the near future, all of them look to apply to Honda\u2019s upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, dubbed the 0 Series. Taking design cues from seemingly everything from a ground-hugging sports car to a 1980s-era Dustbuster vacuum cleaner, the Honda Saloon concept vehicle is a hint at the Japanese automaker\u2019s EV strategy and upcoming designs.\nWith its wedge-shaped body, truncated tail and upward-swinging doors, the Honda Saloon is a head-turning sedan that hints at a production model due in 2026. It will also debut the latest in EV technology, such as a more efficient and longer-lasting battery pack. Just don\u2019t expect that the Saloon\u2019s glowing front grille, gullwing doors and yoke-style steering wheel are all part of the finished product.\nELECTRIC FLYING CARS PROMISE TO BECOME REALITY\nFlying cars seem like something straight out of a science fiction movie, yet they were very much in the here and now at CES 2024. One of the most head-turning is the eVTOL Flying Car created by Chinese automaker XPeng. Equal parts low-lying supercar and high-flying helicopter, this wedge-shaped concept is wildly futuristic and entirely electric powered.\nNotably, the company\u2019s concept isn\u2019t a flying car in the traditional sense. It doesn\u2019t have wings and uses its electrically powered fans to produce lift and fly straight up. It can theoretically take off and land anywhere there\u2019s room, making travel as a sort of gridlock-avoiding city vehicle more likely.\nAnother electric helicopter-like entry at the show was the Supernal S-A2. Supernal is notable for being an offshoot of Hyundai. The connection to the giant South Korean automaker certainly adds some plausibility to the S-A2 turning into reality. The S-A2\u2019s specs aren\u2019t mind-boggling, with a maximum range of just 25-40 miles, but that might be all you need for an aerial taxi.\nSupernal says it hopes the S-A2 will be a production reality by 2028. Still, don\u2019t get your hopes up too much that your daily commute is about to take flight. Wait-and-see is the best approach as other vital details such as price and success overcoming regulatory hurdles all remain very much up in the air.\n_______\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nNick Kurczewski is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Twitter and Instagram\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best EV and car tech of CES 2024: from Honda, BMW, Mercedes and more\nCES 2024 was big for EV and automative innovation\nCars are rapidly becoming an extension of our digital lives \u2013\u00a0and this week's CES 2024 showed how much the two will continue to intertwine this year and beyond.\nWhether it's accessing your calendar on the move or controlling your smart home kit with your voice, cars are increasingly becoming giant smartphones. Add a push towards alternative fuel sources, be it electricity or hydrogen, into the mix, and you can see why the Consumer Electronics Show is becoming a favorite spot for automakers to reveal their latest innovations.\nThis year saw just a handful of new vehicle concepts unveiled, chiefly Honda\u2019s re-writing of its own EV rulebook and Kia\u2019s push into commercial vehicles. But AI assistants and advanced infotainment offerings were arguably the show\u2019s core theme in 2024.\nLuckily for you, we sweatily shuffled over 40km in three days to get hands-on with the most important EV and in-car tech reveals of CES 2024...\n1. Honda resets the EV clock to zero\nHonda's journey towards electrification hasn't exactly been smooth sailing. But at CES 2024, the Japanese company said it wants to remedy that by going back to \"the starting point of Honda as an automaker\". Essentially, it is ripping up its own rulebook and starting afresh.\nThe result is two stunning concepts, the 0 Series Saloon and Space-hub, both offering a glimpse at Honda\u2019s overarching design direction and EV philosophy.\nGlobal CEO Toshihiro Mibe says his company wants to move away from the \"thick and heavy\" electric cars of today and instead focus on a \"thin, light and wise\" philosophy.\nCut through the non-speak and Honda is looking towards the next generation of thinner and lighter battery packs to power its sleek, low and rakish Saloon, which is tipped to be very close to a production version and is promised to inherit the marque\u2019s 'joy of driving' spirit.\nThere\u2019s no word on range and performance, as it\u2019s likely still hypothetical, but both the Saloon and the people moving, lounge-like Space-Hub will both feature advanced driver assist systems, high levels of autonomous driving capabilities and, fingers crossed, some cutting-edge infotainment thanks to Honda\u2019s close ties with multimedia and entertainment giant Sony.\n2. BMW showcases AR driving\nBMW hosted demos of an Xreal Air 2-based augmented reality experience aboard a BMW iX at CES 2024 \u2013\u00a0and TechRadar\u2019s US Editor-in-Chief Lance Ulanoff said that what he saw \"surprised and often delighted\" him.\nThat\u2019s high praise indeed, but rather than merely being a fun gimmick (BMW made it rain AR casino betting chips on our cruise around Las Vegas), it could also be a very handy extension of the navigation and infotainment system in general.\nWith the Xreal Air 2 glasses on, BMW is able to project driver information onto the real world outside the windscreen, with strobing 3D green arrows highlighting upcoming turns, and large red blocks warning when the driver is getting dangerously close to static objects.\nCurrently, the system is running through a smartphone that is connected to the car, but developers behind the tech want to make the entire experience wireless, opening it up to other brands of augmented reality glasses to make the experience as seamless as possible for potential customers.\nBut the ultimate party piece? Flip down the front sun visor and the system becomes an impressively sharp\u00a0private cinema. Perfect for whiling away the hours when charging modern EVs on a cripplingly slow public charging network.\n3. Kia pushes into electric vans\nKia's interpretation of PBV stands for \u2018Platform Beyond Vehicles\u2019, rather than the more commonly used 'purpose built vehicles', but either way this is its break into the electric commercial vehicle market.\nThe upcoming line-up comprises the PV1, PV5 and PV7, which showcase a range of sizes and applications, and span ideas that are very close to production, as well as those that are little more future-thinking.\nThe mid-sized PV5 is our best indication of what Kia\u2019s electric van will look like and its highly modular interior can be configured for a range of scenarios, be it last mile delivery or transporting the family in a ride-hailing service.\nOne of its key USPs is its software defined nature, which allows it to pass data from a central control room to the vehicle and vice versa, making it simple for operators to manage an entire fleet in real time, without the need for additional technology.\nAs we look into the future-gazing crystal ball, we will see fully autonomous versions and what Kia is calling 'Easy Swap' technology, which allows a single vehicle chassis to house multiple upper bodies, effectively transforming it from a cargo carrier to mobile office (and beyond) in minutes thanks to hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling tech.\n4. Mercedes reinvents your driving playlist\nIt was the CES innovation I really wanted to hate, but ended up becoming slightly smitten with, as Mercedes-Benz effectively turned its electric vehicles into musical instruments.\nThanks to Will.i.am and his team of talented developers, the Mercedes-Benz MBUX Sound Drive app deconstructs your favourite tracks and uses information from the vehicle, such as steering inputs, acceleration and braking, to create intriguing, live performance style remixes.\nYou can read our full hands-on MBUX experience for more details, but a quick test of the technology proved it was less a gimmicky way to kill a few minutes, and more a clever way to uniquely soundtrack an audibly-bereft electric vehicle. Hey, I don\u2019t even like The Black Eyed Peas, but MBUX Sound Drive made me reconsider my position.\n5. Harman turns car seats into speakers\nDubbed SeatSonic, Harman\u2019s passenger-centric audio system completely rethinks the in-car listening experience, with one Harman executive going so far as saying it also \"frees car designers from today\u2019s interior constraints\".\nWe\u2019re not sure how much design real estate is actually behind a door card, but the idea is solid, as it sees near-field transducers integrated into the headrests and a proprietary bass unit in the lumbar section of the seats for a viscerally bassy experience.\nThe sound quality is great, although the basic package, where speakers are only installed in the seats, can sound a little dull and distant. To combat this, Harman will offer additional tweeters that nestle beneath the windscreen for a much richer listen.\nBetter still, Harman says that because the audio doesn\u2019t have to travel as far, there is a 60 per cent power saving when compared to a conventional in-car audio set-up. That stuff makes a big difference in today\u2019s world of electric vehicles and range anxiety.\nHarman has been working with seat makers, as well as Tier 1 suppliers that produce automotive grade ventilation, heating and massaging tech, to integrate it into one neat, ready to rock package. So expect to see it go live soon.\n6. Mobion banishes awkward parking situations\nStick with us here, as this one gets a little weird. But Hyundai Mobis, a subsidiary of automotive giant Hyundai, offered a glimpse of a future where tricky parking situations are no more. The Mobion concept car, which is just a jazzy Hyundai Ioniq 5, features the company\u2019s In-Wheel motor technology and upcoming e-Corner drive system.\nHere, all four wheels are driven and can steer independently of one another. Motors in the wheels mean no axles, which frees up each corner to do as it pleases. Well, within reason.\nA live demonstration showed how Mobion can \u2018crab-walk\u2019, where all four wheels rotate 90-degrees and the car effectively performs a sideways scuttle into tough parallel parking spots. The system can move the car diagonally, back and forth, as well as see it rotate a full 360 degrees around its centre axis \u2013 it puts our U-turns to shame.\nNaturally, everything is overseen by Lidar, radar and high-definition cameras, which allows most manoeuvers to be performed autonomously, while exterior projection lighting allows the car to project safety information around it as it performs its party tricks \u2013 seemingly so pedestrians don\u2019t completely freak out.\nThe In-Wheel motor and e-Corner system are \"ready for immediate mass production,\" according to Vice President Lee Seung-Hwan, the Head of Advanced Engineering at Hyundai Mobis. The company just needs to find a suitable Hyundai or Kia product to place it in.\n7. Mullen goes supersonic with its 1,000bhp Five RS\nCalifornian EV maker Mullen took the wraps off potentially one of the most aggressive and utterly banzai electric SUVs were have ever laid eyes on. The performance figures hurt just to look at: 1,000bhp, 0-60mph in under two seconds and a top speed in excess of 200mph.\nAll that, and Mullen says it will feature a two-speed transmission, an 800V electrical architecture for faster charging and offer over 300 miles of real-world range. Race-derived Brembo braking products, bucket seats, and an overtly aggressive stance all come as standard.\nBut because this is a modern EV, it also features an enormous dual screen infotainment set-up that is reported to come complete with a built-in voice assistant.\nAccording to Car and Driver, the Five RS is slated to go on sale in Europe in 2025, with a US version following in 2027. Prices are due to start at an eye-watering $295,000 / \u00a3231,000 / \u20ac268,000 / AUS$441,000.\n8. Hyundai takes to the skies\nIn a purpose-built 'vertiport' outside of the Las Vegas Convention Center sat Hyundai\u2019s Supernal S-A2, the electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) craft that is set to begin testing next year. Designed by Hyundai\u2019s Luc Donckerwolke, the man behind the stunning N Vision 74 (and many others), it takes styling inspiration from the eyes of a bee and features a highly configurable, premium interior that can seat up to four passengers.\nUsing eight tilting rotors, it can fly at speeds of up to 120mph, while the on-board high density battery packs are good for trips ranging from 25 to 40 miles \u2013 although that will increase. The idea is that the craft operates at 1,500ft, way below commercial aircraft, and offers short hops between inner city \u2018vertiports\u2019 using an Uber-style ride hailing platform.\nHead of the project and ex-NASA man Jaiwon Shin, says quietness is key, stating that the S-A2 emits just 65db during take-off and around 45db during cruise, which he says his less than a domestic dishwasher. He wants to avoid people \"looking up\" when it is in operation and hopes it will \"blend into inner-city traffic noise\".\nThe eVTOL craft has 'upgrade-ability' baked into it, meaning the S-A2 is ready to accept the next generation of battery technology. Supernal says it is moving beyond an early technology demonstrator and will begin testing the S-A2 you see before you in 2025.\n9. XPeng reveals pre-order plan for its AeroHT Land Aircraft Carrier\nIf XPeng is the Chinese manufacturer of impressive and altogether highly competitive electric cars, XPeng AeroHT is its slightly bonkers, future-thinking little brother. A sibling that comes up with flying car concepts and six-wheeled off-road MPVs that come complete with a human piloted electric 'Air Module' in the back.\n\"I like flying, I have a helicopter, but I can\u2019t take the helicopter where I want. If I have this car, I can drive to where I want, park up and go flying,\" XPeng AeroHT\u2019s co-founder and vice president, Tan Wang told me at CES this year. \"The car is for customers that like to go off-road, but the performance on the road is way better, because it has three motors, one on each axle\" he added.\nIn addition to this, Wang claims the Air Module is much simpler to operate than a standard helicopter, as it blends human piloting skills with advanced levels of autonomy. Because of this, Wang feels it will require much fewer than 40 flying hours to obtain a helicopter license to legally be able to operate the eVTOL craft.\nWang also went on record to say the company was accepting pre-orders as of the end of this year, and that he hoped to have product in the air by the end of 2025. Both the six-wheeled vehicle and the aircraft can be yours for $200,000 /\u00a3157,000 /\u20ac182,000 / AUS$298,000, which feels like a bit of a bargain to us.\nHowever, Wang also pointed out that his company was \"still in the process\" of obtaining certification from the Chinese Aviation Authority, but he was hopeful it would happen soon.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest\u00a0CES news\u00a0from the show as it happens.
