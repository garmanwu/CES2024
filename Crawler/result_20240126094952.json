Prior to joining The Verge, she covered the intersection between technology, finance, and the economy.\nShare this story\nIn the world of generative AI, it\u2019s a battle of computing power and getting the fastest and most powerful chips. Now, AI edge company Kneron announced it will ship its new neural processing units (NPU) chips by the end of the year.\nKneron said the NPU chips, called the KL730, would make it cheaper to run large language models (LLMs) as the processor is built specifically for machine learning and AI applications.\nThe KL730 is the next generation of previous processors from Kneron. In 2021, the company shipped out the KL530 chips that supported transformer models that underpinned some generative AI models.\nAlbert Liu, CEO of Kneron, tells The Verge that NPU chips are specifically designed for AI and aren\u2019t forcing something originally made for processing graphics to work for it \u2014 an implicit dig at reigning AI chipmaker Nvidia.\n\u201cI will say that if you have a pretty powerful and lightweight chip like ours, then you can bring a powerful transformer model like GPT to many kinds of devices,\u201d Liu said.\nLiu would not disclose the price of the KL730 but notes that users of its KL530 chip saw a 75 percent drop in operating costs compared to GPU chips.\nMost AI companies and cloud providers flock to Nvidia\u2019s H100 Tensor Core GPU chips, as people believe GPUs are the most accessible processors capable of compiling the calculations needed to run generative AI models. But even with that power, it usually takes a lot of H100s to run one large language model, so users have to \u201cbreak up\u201d the model to get it to run.\nEven so, prices for the H100 soared to roughly $40,000 per chip as demand continued to grow. Nvidia already announced plans to release a more powerful AI chip in the second quarter of 2024. Competitors are already waiting in the wings, with AMD planning to release its own AI chips in the fourth quarter of this year.\nKneron said the KL730 \u201cyields a three to four times leap\u201d in energy efficiency compared to previous chips and has a base-level compute power starting at 0.35 tera operations per second.\nThe company said the new chip also allows users to run LLMs fully offline without the need to connect to a cloud provider and handle data more securely.\nMicrosoft lays off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees\nTrolls have flooded X with graphic Taylor Swift AI fakes\nNetflix is turning into cable TV\nPorsche\u2019s second-ever EV will be an electric Macan SUV, starting at $80,450\nApple is bringing sideloading and alternate app stores to the iPhone\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from Artificial Intelligence\nUniversal Music sues AI company Anthropic for distributing song lyrics\nOpenAI is opening up DALL-E 3 access\nYouTube might make an official way to create AI Drake fakes\nThe world\u2019s biggest AI models aren\u2019t very transparent, Stanford study says\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Gartner forecasts that it'll be a $53.4 billion revenue opportunity for the semiconductor industry, a 20.9% uptick from 2022.\nUnsurprisingly, investors are chasing after the opportunity. VC funding for chip startups doubled from 2017 to 2022, according to PitchBook data.\nThat's obviously to the benefit of companies like Kneron.\nKneron was co-founded in 2015 by Liu\u00a0and Frank Chang. Prior to starting the company, Liu spent time in R&D and management positions at Qualcomm and Samsung. Chang was an assistant director at Rockwell before being elected to the nonprofit National Academy of Engineering, which operates engineering, education and research engineering programs.\nWith Kneron, Liu and Chang set out to develop hardware for AI applications -- specifically ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), or chips custom-tailored for a particular use. Today, Kneron supplies low-powered, reconfigurable AI chips that are designed to interface with existing systems, such as the sensors on driverless vehicles, and that can run algorithms ranging from face and body detection models to models to generate text.\nImage Credits: Kneron\nKneron has a number of competitors in the space, including NeuReality, which is building similar AI inferencing accelerator technology. There's also Hailo,\u00a0Mythic\u00a0and\u00a0Flex Logix, to name other upstarts. And in terms of incumbents, Google\u2019s competing for AI inferencing dominance with its tensor processing units\u00a0while Amazon\u2019s betting on\u00a0Inferentia, not to mention the elephant in the room, Nvidia's GPU hardware.\nBut Kneron's done well for itself. Revenue is in the order of \"double digit millions,\" Liu claims, with a customer base that spans ~30 brands including Garmin, Naver and Quanta. Through Otus, an imaging tech provider Kneron acquired in April, Kneron has partnerships with automotive customer like JVC Kenwood.\nIn the short term, Liu says that Kneron will focus on \"strategic directions\" in AI, like autonomous cars, that avoid direction competition with \"existing dominant players.\" Down the line, it'll mount a bigger challenge to incumbents -- potentially through collaborations with third-party vendors. Or at least, that's the plan.\n\"Kneron is poised to become a significant player in this industry,\" Liu said. \"Kneron\u2019s lightweight reconfigurable solutions resolve three major problems faced by AI use cases -- latency, security and cost -- thereby enabling AI everywhere.\""

operational costs after using Kneron\u2019s KL720 NPU in their servers, Liu said.\nThe KL730 can perform even better, he said.\nThe KL730 is also 150 to 200 percent more energy-efficient than products manufactured by major industry peers, the company says.\nAutomakers from Germany and Japan have shown an interest in adopting the KL730 for full-frame detection, a key feature of advanced driver-assistance systems, Liu said.\nLiu said he expects autonomous vehicles to become the largest application for NPUs due to their higher average selling prices, followed by servers.\nKneron counts Quanta Cloud, Chunghwa Telecom and South Korea\u2019s Naver Corp among its server customers.\nSouth Korea\u2019s Hanwha Group has adopted its AI chips for use in surveillance cameras, Kneron said.\nThe KL730 would be available for sampling by customers by the end of this year, the company said, adding that it can be used for enterprise-edge servers, smart home applications and advanced driver-assistance system applications.\nEstablished in 2015, Kneron has raised more than US$140 million, backed by investors including Qualcomm Ventures, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (\u9d3b\u6d77\u7cbe\u5bc6), Horizons Ventures Ltd and Sequoia Capital.\nApart from TSMC, GlobalFoundries Inc and United Microelectronics Corp (\u806f\u96fb) are also Kneron foundry partners.\nMost
