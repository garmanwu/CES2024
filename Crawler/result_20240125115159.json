        "raw_content": "Jump to\nWhy Netflix, Disney, and other Hollywood companies are flocking to CES this year\nNetflix will have its biggest presence in years at tech trade show CES in January, where it will have a booth to promote its new sci-fi drama \"3 Body Problem.\" Attendees will be able to don headsets to immerse themselves in the series, which premieres in March, while the show's creators David Benioff, D.B. Weiss, and Alexander Woo will be on hand to chat with press.\nBut the real action will be happening over at Netflix's private meeting suites, where execs like newly named advertising president Amy Reinhard will court top brand and ad execs who control millions in ad budgets.\nCES, which is produced by the Consumer Technology Association and is known primarily as a showcase for new tech innovations and gadgetry, is making room for a new Hollywood contingent this year. The show takes place January 9-12 in Las Vegas.\nIt's not producers and directors but entertainment sales chiefs who'll be attending en masse, as streamers look to Madison Avenue to turn around their fortunes.\nThe streamers' reps hope to interact with top execs from marketers like L'Or\u00e9al, Chase, and Walmart \u2014 all longtime fixtures of C Space, CES' entertainment and content track. Advertising and marketing pros made up 7% of CES' attendees in 2023, per CES.\nOverall, exhibitors in C Space are expected to be up 10% for 2024. The space will have an expanded footprint to accommodate new players including Disney, Nexstar Media Group, Nvidia, Paramount, Pinterest, and Reddit, said Patrick Pannett, a CTA spokesperson.\n\"The ad sales side of the entertainment business is there because they know the brands are going to be there,\" Michael Kassan, CEO of the advertising consultancy MediaLink, told Business Insider. Kassan is scheduled for a keynote conversation with Snap cofounder and CEO Evan Spiegel.\nLook for topics like the creator economy and the rise of artificial intelligence to dominate the conversation for advertisers, Kassan added. \"Brand safety, AI, direct to creator \u2014 that's going to be the story at CES this year.\"\nRelated stories\nDisney, which is making a bigger run at streaming ad dollars with its newly combined Disney+/Hulu app, is taking its annual Tech and Data Showcase to CES for the first time, with top ad exec Rita Ferro leading the charge. The showcase, which is the company's kickoff to the all-important upfronts TV selling season, is expected to focus on new offerings like shoppable ads and game-like ad experiences.\nNBCUniversal's Mark Marshall will be in attendance to tout the company's new cross-platform selling tool. He'll be joined by groups from NBCU's Peacock.\nNBCUniversal announced January 8 that it would expand access to One Platform Total Audience, a new AI-driven approach to improve ad buying across its linear and streaming portfolio spanning NBC, Bravo, Peacock, and more. As NBCU describes it, the platform uses machine learning to reach advertisers' target audiences in a brand-safe way.\nAlso in attendance will be execs from Amazon Ads, which is getting ready to launch advertising on Prime Video; ad sales VP Tanner Elton and sports partnership lead Amy McDevitt will be speaking, and Ludacris was tapped to perform. Ads chief Jon Steinlauf from Warner Bros. Discovery, which rolled out its mega streamer Max this past year, is scheduled to attend. And Roku, which is closing in on its search for a new ad sales head, is sending a large contingent. Other ad sellers on the show floor for the first time are Walmart and Vizio.\nStreaming continues to grab advertising share from linear TV. IPG's Magna and WPP's GroupM have forecast another year of double-digit growth for streaming in 2024. Magna sees US AVOD/CTV/FAST ad revenue increasing 12.9% in 2024 as linear TV declines 8.5%. GroupM called for CTV+ to increase 13.8% globally in 2024, with traditional TV declining 3%. As streamers push their ad-supported tiers, more than two-thirds of Peacock, Paramount+, and Hulu viewers will subscribe to ad tiers next year, Insider Intelligence predicted.\nThe rosy growth outlook comes with some caveats. The cost advertisers pay for streaming ads is expected to decline as platforms release more inventory, particularly with Amazon unleashing ads on Prime Video. Advertisers also have more options with the fast-growing FASTs (free, ad-supported streaming TV channels), which primarily offer older TV shows and movies.\nStreamers show fewer ads per hour than traditional TV, which will limit the movement of ad dollars in their direction. And advertisers are still proceeding and spending cautiously amid economic uncertainty.\nThat concern will be reflected in attendance, with some agencies sending fewer reps, Kassan suggested: \"We need to be there, but do we need to send 50 people?\"\nThis article was originally published in December.\nDisclosure: Mathias D\u00f6pfner, CEO of Business Insider's parent company, Axel Springer, is a Netflix board member.\nRead next\nWatch: Is the era of the ad agency almost over?

Rita Ferro, president of global advertising at The Walt Disney Company, credited the innovations to the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tech stack.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153We had the foresight to design a state-of-the-art tech stack all from the ground up,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Ferro said. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It was created for the modern advertiser to better reach, match and engage streamers. Our tech stack was intentionally built for streaming, to work seamlessly across the global marketplace.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAmong the highlights, Disney unveiled its first end-to-end shoppable TV ad experience, Gateway Shop. The platform gives consumers a personalized prompt for products on their second screen without disrupting the viewership experience.

(Chief Brand Officer Asad Ayaz focused his segment on the company\u2019s big plans for fan confab D23.)\nRelated Stories\nDisney Shareholder Blackwells Capital Blasts Rival Nelson Peltz For Failing To Come Up With \"A Single Strategic Idea That Would Benefit Shareholders\"\nTop Media Buyer GroupM Names Sharb Farjami North America CEO\nAds are a key component to Disney meeting its closely scrutinized goal of turning a profit in streaming by the end of this year. While the Disney+ flagship reached 150 million global subscribers in the most recent quarter, Iger and his management team continue to face questions about the financial viability of the streaming business. Although scale has enabled the company to implement price increases, ad revenue will take some pressure off the drive to attain subscribers, which Iger himself has conceded was a misstep after the ultra-successful early rollout of Disney+ in late-2019 and 2020.\nAlluding to newer players in streaming advertising (like rival Netflix, though no names were named), Ferro said Disney tech stack was \u201cintentionally built for streaming\u201d many years ago. \u201cWe\u2019re not renting or borrowing our technology,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s no one else\u2019s technology. We own it. And unlike others, who recently decided to get into the advertising business as part of their business strategy, Disney is in it from the beginning.\u201d\nWhile the ad tier of Disney+ is new, having launched a little more than a year ago, Hulu\u2019s roots are deep. The service launched in 2007 as an ad-only streaming outlet before adding a tier for ad-free viewing in 2015. Disney recently took full control of Hulu after buying out Comcast\u2019s one-third stake.\nFerro said half of new subscribers to Disney+ are choosing the cheaper, ad-supported version, with view times on the ad-free and ad-supported tiers thus far nearly the same. That balance \u201cspeaks to the combined quality of our user experience, our content and our advertising,\u201d the exec asserted.\nThe company announced several new offerings for advertisers during the event, including Disney\u2019s first \u201cshoppable\u201d experience, Gateway Shop, and partnerships with Innovid and Lucid Impact Measurement by Cint. Disney is also launching a tech-enabled product it dubs Magic Words, which enables brands to target specific scenes and moments and characters from across the company\u2019s array of networks, studios and platforms. A food advertiser, Ferro explained, could find specific bits of dialogue or segments during a talk show where they could insert their messages.\n\u201cThrough the power of this context, brands can capture a specific moment, mood or emotionand personalize your messaging around that emotion,\u201d Ferro said. \u201cWe believe the combination of being able to reach the right audience in just that right moment or mood has the potential to be magic.\u201d\nThe Magic Words feature is currently \u201cin discovery,\u201d Ferro said, and will roll out at the upfront for beta partners, with full availability by the end of the year.\nMust Read Stories\nSteven Soderbergh\u2019s New Thriller \u2018Presence\u2019 Selling To Neon\nJon Stewart Returning To Host \u2018Daily Show\u2019 On Mondays Through 2024 Elections\nDanny Masterson Denied Bail; Judge Says Actor Has \u201cEvery Incentive To Flee\u201d\nMichael Mann Sets Next Novel After \u2018Heat 2\u2019 At William Morrow Imprint\nSubscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy.\nRead More About:\n6 Comments\nSidebar\nTrending on Deadline\nSignup for Breaking News Alerts & Newsletters\nBy providing your information, you agree to our Terms of Use and our Privacy Policy.\nWe use vendors that may also process your information to help provide our services.

Beet.TV is publishing\u00a0 it courtesy\u00a0of Adwanted Events.\nAn Early Start For Upfronts\n\u201cIn Las Vegas, we\u2019re going to do our tech and data showcase live at CES,\u201d Ferro said. Previously, the presentation was done remotely.\n\u201cSo we do everything tech and data in January because all of that that we roll out as part of what will ultimately be an upfront conversation needs to be put into the planning process.\u201d That doesn\u2019t just include buying plans but also tech and measurement needs, requests for which can be brought to market at the upfronts.\nFerro said the traditional spring-time season when TV companies tout their upcoming offering to secure upfront ad deals remains valuable but is no longer the sole such moment in the year \u2013 now the upfronts is part of a\u00a0process.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not only that May show,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot more that happens. It\u2019s helpful, though, from a overall business (perspective), just in terms of anchoring and getting people focused. But it\u2019s a lot of work.\u201d\nTech Tricks On Show\nDisney\u2019s CES tech showcase will contain previews of new ad formats coming to the platform in 2024.\n\u201cThey\u2019ll be around gamification, around shopification, around how social gets integrated into a broader user experience,\u201d Ferro said.\n\u201cWe know that, when people are streaming, most of that is happening on the big screen \u2013 it is television with more bells and whistles, as I like to say. And so what are those experiences that enhance that? Whether it\u2019s how they purchase, how they interact and have social conversation, community watching, et cetera. So more to come on that, but those are the areas.\u201d\nExperience Creates Engagement\nFerro was speaking a year after Disney+ launched its ad-supported tier.\nShe said:\u00a0It\u2019s going extraordinarily well. We have a thousand advertisers today. \u2026\u00a0Fifty percent of the (US) customers who sign up for Disney+ now are signing up for the ad tier.\u201d\nFerro said Disney was \u201cthoughtful\u201d and \u201ccareful\u201d about its ad tier launch, taking pains to get the experience right. Whereas rivals declared they would launch advertising but lacked an ad-tech stack, \u201cWe\u00a0had Hulu for 15 years prior and we understood audience adoption of an ad supported tier.\u201d\nThat means, for example, ads per brand are capped at two per day, 12 per week. And Ferro likes the results: \u201cFrom March to September, engagement on the ad tier grew 35%.\u201d\nConsolidation Is Coming\nDisney\u2019s new ad offering allows ad buyers to target\u00a02,000 audience segments, but 150 main ones, across Disney+, Hulu and ESPN via streaming TV.\nBut Ferro isn\u2019t throwing out linear just yet \u2013 it remains 50% of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\u201cWhen I look at our linear businesses, average age is somewhere between 50 and 60,\u201d she said. \u201cFor the same show when it\u2019s on a Hulu or Disney+ platform, it\u2019s like 25 to 35. So that opportunity is about incremental reach and that is what advertisers are looking for.\u201d\nFerro is now seeing the emergence of new FAST TV platforms vying for a slice of the CTV ad market.\n\u201cUltimately, you\u2019re going to see consolidation because there\u2019s no way that all of these players can continue to exist without multiple revenue streams,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I do think that you\u2019re going to start to see that (consolidation) in the next 12 to 24 months, pretty aggressively.\u201d\nOpening Up To Buying\nFor its part, Disney+ wants to remain open. While some platforms limit data access like a walled garden, Ferro sees Disney+ as \u201cmore like a hedged garden\u201d.\n\u201cWe have our own tech stack, but we are totally interoperable with 30 DSPs in the market with all of our measurement partners, with all of our clean rooms,\u201d she said.\u00a0\u201cWe have 140 clean rooms set up across the marketplace, whether direct or through agencies.\n\u201cAnd so we\u2019ve created the environment to allow people to buy however they want. And if that means buy directly with Disney, great. And if that means buy through one of our DSP partnerships because that\u2019s the way they want to buy, great.\u201d\nYou\u2019re watching Beet.TV coverage of The Future of TV Advertising Global 2023, presented by Index Exchange.

It was made for you to buy once and deliver everywhere.\u201d\nA procession of executives gave short presentations on innovations and strategic moves made to allow advertisers greater ability to target discrete groups of consumers \u2014 capabilities that Madison Avenue has dreamed of for decades.\nJoe Earley, Disney\u2019s president of direct-to-consumer streaming, sketched out the scope of Disney\u2019s streaming business, which has seen exponential growth since the dawn of ESPN+ in 2018 and Disney+ in 2019. Earley emphasized that while the core Disney brand is synonymous with kid and family-friendly entertainment, with Hulu it also has plenty of options for adult viewers.\n\u201cWe have managed to scale at an astonishing rate,\u201d Earley said, citing 225 million subscribers across Disney+, Hulu, ESPN+ and the Star+ service in India. Disney DTC platforms are active in 150 markets, serving up content in 40 languages. \u201cWe are a top-three global streaming service in every one of these markets where we operate,\u201d Earley said. \u201cA key marketplace differentiator is our unmatched advertising capabilities.\u201d\nDisney is set to launch a fully integrated streaming bundle in the U.S. in March that will bring Hulu content into Disney+. \u201cSince our beta launch began rolling out seamlessly a month ago, engagement with Hulu content in the Disney+ app is beating even our own expectations and continues to grow week-over-week. Consumers are watching more, both in terms of hours and they\u2019re watching a wider variety of programming.\u201d\nDisney brass also unveiled expanded ecommerce functions that will be made available under the Gateway Shop platform to give consumers easy access to buy products seen in content on Disney platforms.\nGateway Shop is \u201cDisney\u2019s first seamless, shoppable TV ad experience,\u201d said Ajay Arora, Disney\u2019s senior VP of commerce, growth and identity. \u201cIt lets the viewer go from interest to action to purchase \u2013 without ever leaving the viewing environment. It\u2019s streaming commerce without disruption.\u201d\nDisney executives repeatedly emphasized the company\u2019s laser focus on brand building to keep engagement high on platforms ranging from ESPN to Disney+ to Hulu.\nAnother announcement was plans to expand the biennial D23 event that courts Disney super-fans for sneak peeks, panels and one-on-ones and other special events.

Disney has launched a beta program for its first native streaming shoppable ad format, which allows consumers to purchase their favorite items without disrupting their viewing experience. With Gateway Shop, these viewers will receive personalized prompts for products that are sent directly to their phones via push notifications or email. Advertisers including Unilever are part of the limited beta, which drives awareness and conversion without disrupting the viewer experience.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153With the most scale in streaming and the strongest audience signal through our foundational data and ad tech stack, Disney is uniquely enabled to power dynamic ad experiences that connect consumer interest and intent to the purchase \u00e2\u20ac\u201c straight from the stream,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Jamie Power, SVP, Addressable Sales, Disney Advertising. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Our goal is to help audiences connect with the brands they love with the least amount of friction, without disrupting the content they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re streaming. Innovation is in Disney\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s DNA, and in a cross-screen world, we believe shoppable experiences not only complement, but elevate, streaming.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nThis next evolution of commerce interactivity taps into the natural behavior of streaming audiences \u00e2\u20ac\u201c which is, most viewers are watching TV with a second screen in their hand or nearby. Research suggests that when given the opportunity to engage with interactive video experiences, consumers choose to do so. According to a survey conducted by Lucid in 2023, 75% of viewers agree they would rather see an interactive TV ad than a standard commercial, particularly when consumers can find out more information about a product or redeem a special discount or offer.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Gateway Shop is a prime example of the holistic approach we take to building viewer-first ad experiences and formats,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Amy Lehman, SVP, Advertising Platforms. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Audience behaviors have changed, and advertising should reflect that and serve both viewers and marketers in new ways. Gateway Shop provides viewers with choice and control, in an engaging and non-disruptive format.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nOver the next few months, Disney will continue to enhance its interactive formats and commerce experiences in streaming, including the ability to send personalized emails and prompts for push notifications for products or offers within a TV ad unit.\nAfter inventing the original viewer-first and choice-based formats with Binge and Pause Ads on Hulu, Disney continues to lead as a longtime innovator in this space. Disney additionally previously introduced GatewayGo, the company\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first iteration of a commerce-enabled ad format, which tapped into the second screen to deliver viewers personalized offers or promotions directly to their mobile device via email, push notification, or QR code. Since its launch in 2020, more than 200 advertisers across all categories have signed on to use this transactional format.\nMedia Contacts\nKelly Liyakasa\nKelly.s.liyakasa@disney.com\nJane Ha\nJane.ha@disney.com\nRelated Articles\nHyundai IONIQ 5 Disney100 Platinum Edition Now Available at Select Dealerships\nJanuary 22, 2024\nJanuary 22, 2024\nJan 22\nDisney Debuts Future of Entertainment and Advertising at Fourth Annual Tech & Data Showcase at CES\u00c2\nJanuary 11, 2024\nJanuary 11, 2024\nJan 11\nDisney Taps Innovid and Lucid to Help Brands See Real-Time Success\nJanuary 10, 2024\nJanuary 10, 2024\nJan 10\nDisney Campaign Manager Continues Acceleration Through Automation and Self Serve\nJanuary 10, 2024\nJanuary 10, 2024\nJan 10\nDisney Expands Award-Winning Clean Room Technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Giving Access to More Cloud Service Providers\u00c2\nJanuary 10, 2024\nJanuary 10, 2024\nJan 10\nHelp\nAbout and Legal"

The daylong Variety Entertaiment Summit on Jan. 10 served up a powerhouse slate of executives, entrepreneurs, movers and shakers and even a TikTok star in comedian Leenda Dong.\nAs ever, Team Variety\u2018s mission is to track trends and new developments in content production and monetization, streaming distributon, brand-building and the seemingly never-ending cycle of speculation about mergers and acquisitions in media. The episode features a post-summit group chat between \u201cStrictly Business\u201d hosts Cynthia Littleton, co-editor in chief of Variety, and Andrew Wallenstein, president and chief media analyst of Variety Intelligence Platform (VIP), along with Todd Spangler, Variety\u2018s longtime digital editor, and Audrey Schomer, VIP\u2019s media analyst and research editor.\nAmong the highlights of the summit was a panel on the future of content monetization with advertising sales chiefs for Disney, Netflix, Warner Bros.

That clip and other panel highlights from the summit are woven into this episode.\nDong, who boasts nearly 18 million followers on TikTok alone, charmed the CES crowd during her one-on-one with Spangler. How do social media creators make money? In a word: sponsors, sponsors, sponsors. To wit, even Dong\u2019s link in her bio includes a plug for Domino\u2019s Pizza.

        "raw_content": "News\nFinance\nSports\nEntertainment\nLife\nDisney is Letting Advertisers Buy Disney Plus, Hulu Together (CES 2024)\nThe Walt Disney Co., which is adding Hulu content to its Disney Plus streaming service, told advertisers that they will be able to buy commercials across both Hulu and Disney Plus in a single campaign.\nDisney has also announced the launch of a new commerce platform, Gateway Shop.\nSpeaking at the Disney Tech and Data Showcase in Las Vegas, where media companies and agencies are beginning upfront conversations at CES, Disney Global Advertising president Rita Ferro urged advertisers to start their streaming strategy with Disney.\nAlso Read: More Coverage From CES 2024\nFerro said that 2023 was Disney\u2019s year for investments in ad technology, including the global expansion of Hulu content into Disney Plus.\n\u201cWe\u2019re not slowing down,\u201c Ferro said. \u201dThis commitment means a better experience for consumers and better performance for you.\u201d\nDisney has built its one ad tech stack to monetize its streaming assets, including Hulu, Disney Plus and ESPN Plus.\n\u201cIt was made for you to buy once and deliver everywhere,\u201c Ferro said. \u201cWe\u2019re not renting or borrowing someone else\u2019s technology. We own it.\n\u201cUnlike others who just recently decided to get into advertising as part of a new business strategy, Disney has been in it since the beginning,\u201d she added in a pointed reference to Netflix, the company Disney\u2019s streaming business is chasing.\nFerro noted that more than half of new subscribers to Disney Plus are choosing its ad-supported tier. Viewers of the ad tier are spending almost the same amount of time with content as those not seeing ads, she said.\nShe added that since Disney began testing the Disney Plus-Hulu combination last year, \u201cbundle subscribers are loving having Hulu and Disney Plus.\u201d\nThe combo will also be good for advertisers \u201csimplifying and maximizing advertiser impact across two of the top streaming services in the world with the best originals, deep libraries and an unmatched commitment to consumers.\u201d\nJoe Earley, who heads Disney\u2019s direct-to-consumer business, said that since the beta launch of Hulu on Disney Plus, engagement with Hulu content in the Disney Plus app is \u201cbeating even our own expectations and continues to grow week-over-week.\u201d\nHe said consumers are watching more hours and a wider variety of programming.\nHulu will officially be a part of the Disney Plus app in March, he said.\nThe foundation of Disney\u2019s tech stack is the dedicated Disney Ad Server, said Ajay Arora, senior VP of streaming for Disney Streaming.\n\u201cA modern technology platform requires more than just state-of-the-art ad decisioning,\u201d Arora said. \u201cThat\u2019s why ours draws on data from a truly unique audience graph, with thousands of audience segments, allowing you to target and reach your consumers.\n\u201cThis stack has to be agile to work in any way you want to do business,\u201d he added \u201dSo we\u2019ve made automation a key part of our offering, with self-service and programmatic opportunities as core features.\u201d\nMeasurement is built directly into the platform as well.\n\u201cWhen you combine decisioning, data, automation and measurement, it gives you a massive competitive advantage in meeting your business needs,\u201d Arora said.\nDisney also announced its latest move into T-commerce with Gateway Shop.\n\u201cIt lets the viewer go from interest to action to purchase without ever leaving the viewing environment, It\u2019s streaming commerce without disruption,\u201d Arora said.\nGateway Shop is in testing mode now, and Disney is seeing a boost of up to 5 times the engagement by using the Gateway capabilities.\nViewers will be able to \u201cShop the Stream,\u201d and Disney will help marketers with the Disney Experience Composer, a set of tools to create immersive ad experiences.\nDisney said that its spending on tech has generated results for advertisers.\n\u201cAcross thousands of campaigns leveraging Lucid, Innovid and Affinity measurement solutions, Disney delivered across the board,\u201d Dana McGraw, senior VP, audience modeling and data science, said.\n\u201cAt the top of the funnel, Disney surpassed industry norms for ad recall, brand consideration, purchase intent and brand favorability in every category,\u201d McGraw said.\nDisney\u2019s lower funnel metrics also look good. She said data from Affinity Solutions shows that Disney delivered a spend rate lift 2 times greater than campaign norms, while measurement by Innovid demonstrated Disney overperforming in campaign response rate across categories like retail, financial services and pharma.\nAdvertisers will be getting results from their campaign in real time through new dashboards.\n\u201cWith Innovid, we\u2019re currently in beta on a customizable solution that gives advertisers the ability to immediately learn whether your creative is working,\u201d McGraw said.\n\u201cWe optimize towards the \u2018winner\u2019 in real time, which increases the return on your investment with Disney,\u201d she explained. \u201cCurrently, we can empower this solution for web/app attribution results. Disney and Innovid are also working together on incorporating other signals as part of this effort including purchase data.\u201d\nSaying the Magic Words\nNo Disney presentation would be complete without a bit of magic, and Ferro introduced ad clients to Disney\u2019s Magic Words, which taps into the moods and emotions its content generates.\n\u201cThis new technology allows us to analyze scenes and visuals across the Disney library,\u201c Ferro said. \u201cThink about every reference, every line of a dialogue, every emotion, the context of each scene \u2026 Through the power of this context \u2014 brands can capture a specific moment, mood or emotions and personalize your messaging around that emotion.\u201d\nFor example, think of a scene with characters at the kitchen or restaurant talking about being hungry.\n\u201cNow imagine you\u2019re a brand running across our portfolio \u2026 or wanting to connect with food culture,\u201d Ferro said. \u201cYou will be able to run an ad buy that optimizes your creative to a contextual mood within these collections of scenes that deal with food or dinner conversation.\u201d\nDisney Magic Words will be available this upfront to beta partners and be expanded by the end of the year, she said."
