That product immediately harvested public attention and went on hot sale afterward.\nAfter one year of research and development based on the C1, Fog Hashing was back at CES 2023 with its latest product, the C2. In addition to the sleek aesthetics inherited from C1, four universal wheels have been added to C2, allowing it to travel around more easily. The sleek 1.35-inch OLED screen allows both touchscreen control and real-time display of the system's operating status, making this hardcore mining machine more like a well-designed modern home appliance.\nBesides its appearance, the C2 model is more pragmatic. As an upgraded model from C1, it optimized more than 30 details. The most eye-catching aspects are:\nFog Hashing comes with its consumer end products, the C1, C2 and B6D, filling the gap in the consumer market.\nA Mind-Blowing Product You May Never Have Seen Before\nApart from deep cultivation in the emerging decentralized consumer end market, Fog Hashing also devotes itself to the large-scale centralized commercial mining market.\nFog Hashing's B6 and B24 tanks are all easily expandable for massive warehouse deployment, and the BC20 and BC40 mega mining containers have two options of external cooling systems to suit various climate environments, from the humid jungles in the Amazon to the dry Sahara, from the freezing Canadian tundra to the blazing Arabian Peninsula.\nAnd the most mind-blowing product is the newly announced M6-56, a milestone in the entire mining industry.\nFog Hashing's M6-56 will cure a headache that mining farms are facing nowadays - the refitting of current air-cooling models to immersion cooling costs labor and time expenses. More consequentially, it leads to the void of warranty.\nBorn to be the world's first all-in-one immersion miner, Fog Hashing's M6-56 is deeply integrated with Whatsminer's M56, its first pure immersion mining rig. Some highlights are:\nUnprecedented Momentum in the Mining Industry\nThough still at a young age, this Singaporean company has operated globally. Its supply chain management office in China provides customers with low-cost products, while its strategic development office in Silicon Valley, USA, not only equips Fog Hashing with state-of-the-art technology but also enhances its cooperation with multiple other companies in or beyond the mining industry.\nFog Hashing collaborated with iBeLink and co-developed the world's first official immersion cooling miner, the iBeLink U series. A joint appearance of Fog Hashing and iBeLink released the latest products, BM-K3 and BM-N3 series, air-cooling models for now, but the immersion cooling version will be available soon.\nThe cooperation with Whatsminer on the M6-56, of course, can't be ignored. Other cross-industry contributions include petrochemistry (the coolant) and chip-making (the next-generation chips targeting the cryptomining industry). Fog Hashing is holding an online launching event to release more information.\nThe past year has been challenging for everyone, but Fog Hashing still seems dynamic and ambitious.
