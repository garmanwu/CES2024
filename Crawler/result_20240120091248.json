Why not Moonwalk While You Work?\nShift Robotics aims to take the load off and make working hard on your feet all day in warehouses and logistics centers more fun with the latest iteration of its Moonwalkers robotic shoes. What\u2019s key here? You guessed it: AI. The Moonwalkers leverage AI to measure a person\u2019s step 100 times per second.\nShift Robotics' Moonwalkers robotic shoes allow users to move at speeds threefold their usual pace while adopting a heel-toe motion. Customers in corporate and commercial settings have seen productivity boosts of twofold more, particularly for employees who walk for extended periods, averaging up to 30,000 steps per day. Interestingly, after a month of Moonwalkers testing, a warehouse in Jacksonville, Florida, reported a twofold increase in productivity. The customer also reported an ROI payback period of under one month per pair for one company and a global retailer saving over 360 hours annually per employee in a mid-sized store in Scandinavia.\nNeedless to say, moonwalking while working in a warehouse environment seems like a great way to work. Happy feet make light the work.\nMitsubishi\u2019s Vision of Transformation\nAt Mitsubishi Electric Group\u2019s booth at CES, attendees experienced interactive displays, live presentations, demonstrations, and videos covering the global leader\u2019s latest technologies. The group intends to morph into a \u201cCircular-Digital-Engineering\u201d company, using its sustainability-focused businesses to address social challenges: \"inclusion,\" \"carbon neutral,\" \"circular economy,\" \"well-being,\" and \"safety/security.\" As to how these global leaders intend to manifest those trendy words and phrases?

Innovators and innovative firms interested in experiencing the power and ease-of-use of these robotic shoes at CES 2024 are invited to reserve a Guaranteed VIP Appointment to Test-Walk in Moonwalkers X at the Shift Robotics' booth at CES - #CP-20 (in the Central Plaza of the Las Vegas Convention Center).\nAUSTIN, TX and LOS VEGAS, NV / ACCESSWIRE / January 3, 2024 / Shift Robotics' newest model of robotic shoes are called Moonwalkers X, and they will be unveiled next week at CES 2024, America's largest technology-focused convention and trade show.\nThese newest robotic shoes from Shift Robotics are notable for several reasons (when compared to the original model of Moonwalkers). For example, Moonwalkers X\nAre significantly lighter - one pound less for each shoe;\nIncorporate a complete overhaul of the control system, further boosting safety and agility when maneuvering, especially in close quarters;\nDeliver improved shock absorption to further lower the risk of repetitive injury; and\nShowcase a fresh new design with modularity and customization in mind.\nAdditionally, Moonwalkers X will also fit smaller shoe sizes.\nTaken in concert, Moonwalkers X are specifically designed for business/commercial use, particularly those applications where employees walk a lot on-the-job, such as in the distribution, logistics, and warehouse marketplace where individuals might walk as many as 30,000 steps per day.\nMoonwalkers X are slated to begin shipping in the first half of 2024, with pricing to be released at that time.\nShift Robotics has also reserved a limited quantity of Moonwalkers X for innovative companies interested in guaranteeing priority access to the new model of robotic shoes when they become available. Those interested should contact the company about its CES 2024 Show Special.\n\"With Moonwalkers X, we've redefined lightweight mobility by trimming nearly a pound from the original design,\" said Xunjie Zhang, CEO and founder of Shift Robotics, and Moonwalkers inventor. \"Imagine the ease of workers' boots but with the power of Moonwalkers. Our revamped drivetrain, the magnesium alloy based frame, and the new shock-absorbing wheels all come together to offer the smoothest, most efficient warehouse navigation ever.\n\"In developing X, our focus was clear: enhancing productivity without compromising safety. By collaborating closely with our 3PL partners, we've tuned Moonwalkers X to meet the rigors of warehouse environments with an unwavering commitment to worker safety.\n\"As such, ShiftOS 2.0 is born from our insights into thousands of existing Moonwalkers users and our logistics partners - a complete reinvention of our control system. It's packed with tons of safety enhancements, from advanced traction control to more responsive acceleration and braking, plus refined gait detection to eliminate abrupt stops, ensuring every step is secure and smooth.\"\nAccording to the company, its clients have found that warehouse workers responsible for shipping products more than double their productivity by wearing Moonwalkers. Additionally, one Shift Robotics' client projects that its Moonwalkers-wearing employees will save nearly 400 hours per year in Travel Time, the amount of time associates take to walk from location to location within its facilities during their work days.\nAccording to Zhang, Shift Robotics expects to see comparable or better results with Moonwalkers X.\n\"Given these new features, I will not be surprised at all to see our business clients realize even greater results by deploying Moonwalkers X in their distribution centers, warehouses, logistics facilities, and retail locations,\" he said.\nWith more than 130,000 individuals expected to participate in CES 2024 next week, Shift Robotics invites innovation executives and innovative organizations interested in improved productivity to schedule an appointment to Test-Walk in Moonwalkers at CES 2024 in the Shift Robotics booth - #CP-20 in the Central Plaza - immediately east of the Las Vegas Convention Center in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nConversely, for those not attending CES but who are nonetheless interested in exploring how robotic shoes can transform their organizations, Shift Robotics also invites these executive to schedule a time for an initial conversation with the company by clicking on this link.\nAbout Moonwalkers\nNamed recently by TIME as one of the \"Best Inventions of 2023,\" Moonwalkers are robotic shoes that use AI software to measure a user's stride 100-times-per-second, thus enabling each shoe to adjust to the Gait Cycle of each individual, thereby maximizing safety, enjoyment, and performance while walking.\nAbout Shift Robotics\nHeadquartered in Austin, Texas, Shift Robotics is the creator of the \"Robotic Shoes\" category.

        "raw_content": "The Robot Report\nTop 10 robots seen at CES 2024\nBy Mike Oitzman | January 13, 2024\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 CES 2024 featured a wide range of emerging technologies, from fitness devices and videogames to autonomous vehicles. But robots always have a significant presence in the sprawling exhibit halls.\nThe Robot Report visited numerous booths in the Eureka Park section of CES, as well as in the other focused sections of the event. Here are some highlights from this week\u2019s event:\nMobinn climbs stairway toward success\nMobinn is a Korean startup focused on last-mile autonomous delivery vehicles. While the concept of last-mile delivery isn\u2019t new, Mobinn demonstrated an innovative wheeled robot that can climb stairs.\nThe robot is capable of going up and down stairs through the implementation of compliant wheels. A self-leveling box on top of the robot keeps the cargo level, so your drinks and food don\u2019t spill out of their containers.\nGlidance guides people with vision impairments\nThe latest prototype of the Glidance device is fully functional for public demos and includes a camera in the handle and radar sensors in the base. | Credit: The Robot Report\nRoboBusiness PitchFire 2023 winner Glidance also won a CES 2024 Innovation Award and showed the latest functional prototype of its Glide device in its booth. The robotic Glide guides sight-impaired individuals similar to a guide dog.\nThe startup is designing Glide to be affordable and easy to learn how to use when it starts shipping later this year. I tried Glide firsthand (while closing my eyes). The experience was incredible, and I can only imagine how promising this technology would be for an individual with sight loss.\nThe team at Glidance mentioned to me that celebrity Stevie Wonder came to the Glidance booth for a demo of the product during CES.\nUnitree H1 humanoid steals the show\nThere were two full-size humanoid robots at CES 2024.\nKepler Robotics had a stationary model of the new Kepler Forerunner K1 in its Eureka Park booth. The robot includes 14 linear-axis motors and 14 rotary-axis motors. Unfortunately, the company was unable to give live demos of the Forerunner.\nThe Unitree H1 humanoid robot uses sensors in its \u201chead\u201d to perceive the world around the robot as it navigates and avoids obstacles. | Credit: The Robot Report\nThe internet influencer darling of CES has to be the Unitree H1 humanoid, and the company was giving nearly continuous live demos of the H1 at its booth.\nKudos to the Unitree marketing team for its now-infamous \u201ckick the robot\u201d videos that have been shared on social media over the past six months. In the videos, H1 appears to be a solid humanoid platform with respectable balance and agility.\nHowever, as a longtime robotics industry insider and experienced robotics applications engineer, I thought the Unitree H1 product demos at CES 2024 were cringe-worthy, as the Unitree demo team walked the H1 robot into crowds of \u201cinternet tech influencers\u201d with their cameras ablaze.\nThe 150 lb. (68 kg) robot danced with the public inches away. A single tripping incident would have sent the robot tumbling into an innocent bystander and made instant headlines. It would have been a public relations disaster and a setback for the industry.\nHowever, there\u2019s no denying that the H1 was a crowd favorite at CES 2024, and the company and its robot received a lot of news media attention.\nHyundai displays future mobility tech at CES 2024\nHyundai PnD Module concept\nThe company had multiple large-scale booths showing autonomy concepts for the future, including autonomous mobility for both humans and freight, as well as a look at the future of autonomous construction vehicles. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get to witness either of the live mobility demonstrations, but the Hyundai Construction Xite concept tractor was an impressive incarnation of autonomous construction designs.\nHyundai presented a concept for the future of autonomous construction equipment with the display of the Construction Xite tractor (Editors note: for scale, the bucket arm is over 10 ft tall). | Credit: The Robot Report\nAV24 rolls into the showroom\nThe Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) had an impressive booth in the automotive hall of CES 2024, surrounded by well-known brand names. On display was a fully functional version of the newest AV24 autonomous racecar, showing off the integration of an entirely new autonomy stack in the vehicle.\nThe IAC has partnered with many of the leading automotive technology companies to embed the latest lidar, radar, vision, and GPS sensors within the vehicle.\ndSpace announced an extended partnership with IAC that will deliver digital twins of each university team\u2019s vehicle along with digital twins of each of the race tracks. In turn, these will enable the teams to train the AI drivers completely in simulation and then port the AI models and drive code directly the physical race cars.\nIn addition, some sanctioned sim races are possible later this year, said the IAC organizers.\nEmbodied AI displays updated Moxie\nThe latest generation of Moxie by Embodied AI was on display in Amazon\u2019s booth at CES. Embodied recently announced new tutoring functionality with the latest software release for Moxie, and it demonstrated the software at the expo.\nAmazon had a separate expo suite that featured all of the physical Amazon consumer and smart home products (Amazon Astro was noticeably absent from the display). Moxie entertained the gathered crowds as it demonstrated its interactivity.\nFingervision measures gripper force\nMy \u201cUnknown Discovery\u201d award of CES 2024 goes to a young Japanese startup called Fingervision. This was a serendipitous discovery of an innovation that uses tiny cameras built into the gripper fingers of an industrial robot,\nThey provide feedback on the grip force and \u201cslippage\u201d of an item held with the gripper. This is accomplished by imaging the area where the fingers touch an object through an opaque surface. Thus the origin of the company name.\nThe company has deployed its first grippers into an application where robots are picking up fried chicken nuggets and packaging them.\nHonorable mentions from CES 2024\nGatik keeps on trucking \u2014 autonomously\nGatik showed the third generation of its on-road autonomous truck. The company has made its mark on autonomous logistics through the deployment of driving algorithms that plans paths so that the vehicle only makes right-hand turns, avoiding more complex and dangerous left-hand turns.\nGatik first demonstrated fully driverless, freight-only commercial deliveries on the middle mile with Walmart in 2021. Shortly after, it\u00a0executed the first fully driverless deployment for Canada\u2019s largest retailer, Loblaw.\nThe company also announced a partnership with Goodyear tires to develop \u201cSmart Tires\u201d that can provide real-time feedback to the autonomous driver with data about the condition of the tires to help maintain traction and control.\nBobcat Rogue X2 gets ready to move the earth\nAt CES 2024, Bobcat showed off an autonomous concept prototype, the Bobcat Rogue X2, at CES 2024. The all-electric, autonomous robot is designed for handling material movement and ground-altering operations at construction, mining, and agriculture sites.\nThe design prototype of the Rogue X2 at CES had wheels rather than tracks, but manually driven Bobcats can be equipped with tracks, so a production version of the Rogue could have similar configurations.\nOttonomy IO partners with Harbor Lockers\nThrough a new partnership with Harbor Lockers, the latest generation of Ottobot can now be configured with a payload of Harbor Lockers. This includes the Harbor Locker physical locker infrastructure, as well as the Harbor Locker application interface.\nThis is the first time that Ottonomy is partnering with a third-party vendor to extend the autonomous last-mile delivery solution.\nLawn-mowing robots arrive in North America\nCES is one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer electronics shows. While The Robot\u00a0Report doesn\u2019t typically cover consumer robotics, it is notable that lawn-mowing robotics were ubiquitous at CES this year, with a dozen vendors showing their autonomous systems.\nThe European market for consumer lawnmowers is already mature, but the North American market is in the early stages of adoption. Without testing all of the different lawnmowing robots, it\u2019s difficult to determine the market leaders, but the two most promising solutions that I saw at the show included the new Yarbo Lawn Mower and the latest generation of Navimow from Segway Robotics.\nmowers-navimow\nMike Oitzman is Editor of WTWH's Robotics Group and founder of the Mobile Robot Guide.

It\u2019s translucent, as in you can see right through it, even when there\u2019s something on the screen.\nA darker film rises from the base at the touch of the remote, turning it into a gorgeous next-generation, more \u201cnormal looking\u201d 4K TV, too. Watching it in action resembles the way transition sunglasses go from clear inside to darker when you go outside in the sun. Because OLEDs \u2014 organic light-emitting diodes \u2014 can be printed on any surface, the screen is basically a transparent piece of glass no wider than a smartphone.\nThe set's base is wider because it houses all the speakers and other important TV tech guts\u00a0\u2014\u00a0but it\u2019s still sleek and futuristic looking\u00a0\u2014\u00a0the kind of set that would spark TV envy in any neighborhood on the planet. It\u2019s also wireless, thanks to\u00a0LG\u2019s Zero Connect technology, which we first showed you during\u00a0CES 2023. That means you can actually put this new screen in front of a window without blocking the view.\nWhy would you want a see-through screen? Because having a giant black box on the wall is so 2020. Now, it\u2019s there when you want it and not when you don\u2019t. LG says they expect it out later this year, but there is no word yet on pricing.\nNot to be outdone, Samsung also teased the \u201cworld\u2019s first transparent MicroLED display,\u201d but it seems a bit further out from hitting the consumer market.\u00a0Two of the demo units had tinted glass, while a third looked totally clear in its frameless display.\nThe Samsung set I spent even more time checking out, though, is their new\u00a0flagship 65-inch QN900D Class Neo QLED 8K set\u00a0with brilliant picture quality and mind-blowing sound that the company says is thanks to the latest AI Gen 3 processors tucked inside.\nSamsung also says it\u2019s the \u201cslimmest, most premium 8K TV to ever hit the market,\u201d\u00a0delivering\u00a0enhanced 8K upscaling and promising to sharpen low-resolution content to \u201cOMG \u2014\u00a0I feel I'm right there in real life\u201d \u2014 ultra-high resolution. One example? It automatically detects the type of sport you\u2019re watching and uses deep learning to help you track the specific kind of ball on the screen with \u201ccrystal clarity.\u201d There is no word yet on pricing or release date.\nThese Robot Shoes Are Made for Walking \u2026 Really Fast\nStrapping on a pair of\u00a0Shift Robotics Moonwalkers X\u00a0new robotic \u201cAI Informed\u201d shoes felt like taking a step into the future. They look kind of like super high-tech roller skates, but each magnesium platform that you Velcro your own shoes onto has it\u2019s an operating system that controls a drive train. The smart shoes communicate with each other to keep you steady and sailing ahead \u2014 up to 7MPH \u2014 or about 3 times faster than normal.\nYou don\u2019t skate. You don\u2019t glide. You don\u2019t do anything except walk, heel-to-toe. There\u2019s no real learning curve. To speed up, you just take a bigger stride. To slow down or stop, you just \u2026 slow down or stop. On-board regenerative brakes slow you down and bring you to a smooth standstill, similar to how the brakes work on most electric vehicles.\nEach \u201cshoe\u201d weighs about four pounds, so they\u2019re heavy, but they make you move so much faster that you end up taking fewer steps overall. A company spokesperson says this is a big deal for the 6 million people who work in warehouses and distribution centers in the U.S.\nShift Robotics has been testing robot shoes at IKEA\u2019s flagship store in Sweden and says they\u2019ve helped boost productivity by around 250% in some cases. People who normally walk about 30,000 steps per day have been able to do the same amount of work even faster, with just 1,300 \u201cskeps.\u201d (I just made that word up - it\u2019s skate+steps, and I think it should be what we call this new mode of techy- movement.) I can also see this for end-point commutes or even the e-bike crowd, who feel the need for easier speed.\nThe company has not announced the price yet, but they expect to ship Moonwalkers X before July of this year.\nUp, Up, but Not Too Far E-Way\nElectric vehicles are back in full fleet this CES, including the new\u00a0Helix ultralight eVTOL from Pivotal. It\u2019s a fully carbon-fiber, 348-pound \u201calmost\u201d flying car concept, but without wheels. It takes off vertically, like a helicopter, and can fly for about 20 minutes or 20 miles at speeds around 60mph. It soars to altitudes between 400 and 1,200 feet, and you don\u2019t need a pilot\u2019s certificate to fly it, but the company does train you extensively before take off.\nWho might buy this kind of futuristic flying machine? The company says ranchers, aviation pioneers, former pilots, adventure-seekers, and Silicon Valley types who can afford six figures for that last leg of their commute are among the people pre-ordering it. A $250 deposit gets you in, but the actual price tag starts around $190,000.\nWe\u2019re about to go play with some cute little robots from Samsung and LG, and will have a whole lot more to show off from the Super Bowl of consumer tech. Be sure to keep checking back here for the very latest."

They\u2019re here and they\u2019re called Moonwalkers. Shift Robotics introduced the Moonwalkers last summer and have returned with an improved version, the Moonwalkers X. The shoes are mostly designed for business and commercial use. But I do not see why you couldn\u2019t buy these for no particular reason at all.\nEstimated reading time: 3 minutes\nMoonwalkers X are specifically designed for business/commercial use, particularly those applications where employees walk a lot on-the-job, such as in the distribution, logistics, and warehouse marketplace where individuals might walk as many as 30,000 steps per day. The company isn\u2019t really seeking to make people lazy, but I certainly can see some people buy these just for fun.\nPlease enable JavaScript\nThese newest robotic shoes from Shift Robotics are notable for several reasons (when compared to the original model of Moonwalkers). For example, Moonwalkers X.\n\u201cIn developing Moonwalkers X, our focus was clear: enhancing productivity without compromising safety. By collaborating closely with our 3PL partners, we\u2019ve tuned Moonwalkers X to meet the rigors of warehouse environments with an unwavering commitment to worker safety.\u201d\nAccording to the company, its clients have found that warehouse workers responsible for shipping products more than double their productivity by wearing Moonwalkers X. Additionally, one Shift Robotics\u2019 client projects that its Moonwalkers-wearing employees will save nearly 400 hours per year in \u2018Travel Time,\u2019 the amount of time associates take to walk from location to location within its facilities during their workdays.\nPricing and availability has not been announced, but the original Moonwalkers are available on the company\u2019s website for $1,399.\nWhat do you think of these robotic shoes from Shift Robotics?

This enables the software embedded in each shoe to improve the Gait Cycle of each wearer, thereby maximizing performance, safety, and enjoyment while walking, whether in professional or personal settings.\nMoonwalkers robotic shoes from Shift Robotics enable employees and consumers to walk at up to 3X the speed they can normally walk in a natural heel-toe, heel-toe fashion. In business/commercial settings, Moonwalkers customers are seeing productivity gains of 2X or higher, especially for employees who walk a lot for their jobs.\nIn fact, initial commercial customers are seeing productivity gains or 2X and more for their employees who wear Moonwalkers at work, many of whom spend much of their workdays on their feet, with some walking up to 30,000 steps per day.\n\"After more than a month of testing and evaluating Moonwalkers in their facility in Jacksonville, Florida, one customer found that warehouse workers responsible for shipping products more than doubled their productivity by wearing Moonwalkers,\" said\u00a0Xunjie Zhang, CEO and founder of\u00a0Shift Robotics, and Moonwalkers inventor. \"With such results, this company also found that its Payback Period was under one month per pair of Moonwalkers. Comparably, a lengthy internal study by a global household goods retailer in one of its mid-sized stores in Scandinavia found that Moonwalkers save over 360 hours per year per employee.\n\"Moonwalkers transform walking for all users, from employees to consumers. Our AI-informed software tracks the Gait Cycle of each user to make near instantaneous changes to the performance of these robotic shoes. And in business settings, the outcome is not only the ability to walk up to 3X faster than normal, but productivity boosts of two times or more.\"\nWarehouse workers who wear Moonwalkers robotic shoes from Shift Robotics, such as the woman shown passing her co-worker wearing regular shoes, are over 200% more productive than their colleagues who do not wear Moonwalkers.\nShift Robotics\u00a0invites innovation executives and innovative organizations interested in improved productivity outcomes to\u00a0schedule an appointment to test-walk in Moonwalkers at CES 2024 in the\u00a0Shift Robotics\u00a0booth - #CP-20 in the Central Plaza.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nAI at CES 2024: Biggest announcements so far\nChatGPT in cars and grills with AI\nAlmost every announcement, keynote, and product at CES 2024 so far has included some type of update on of artificial intelligence.\u00a0From LG\u2019s robot butler to a grill that uses AI to improve cooking time and quality, the technology of the day is everywhere.\nIn some cases, AI is just a part of a bigger product, like using vision technology in a robot vacuum to improve object avoidance.\u00a0Elsewhere it is the entire announcement, such as Samsung going \u201call in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its product range.\nPart of this is so companies can capitalize on the hype surrounding AI, which anecdotally makes it easier to get funding. The bigger part is that the technology has matured to a point where it brings significant improvements in some areas.\nWhat has been announced around AI at CES 2024\nTo better break down the hype and find the real gems I\u2019ve pulled together some of the biggest announcements in the AI space at CES 2024.\nLG unveils smart home robot\nLG kicked off its CES showcase with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a \u201cZero Labor Home.\u201d\u00a0This AI-powered butler bot can organize your smart devices and even keep an eye on your pets when you\u2019re not home.\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for potential issues, and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience.\nThanks to the inclusion of Qualcomm\u2019s Robotics RB5 Platform, LG's robot uses AI to learn your interests and behaviors and get better over time at serving as a friendly home companion.\nSamsung declares \u201cAI for all\u201d at CES\nSamsung has been pushing the AI in everything narrative since last year and its keynote at CES \u2014 dubbed \"AI for all\" \u2014 turned out to be no different. The company makes everything from smartphones to home appliances and AI will be incorporated across the full range of products.\nWe've already seen details of refrigerators with cameras and AI vision technology. This allows the device to recommend recipes based on what it can see in the fridge. The company has also unveiled televisions with AI built in that can scale content to improve resolution and enhance the depth perception of an image. And there are also robot mops and vacuums that use AI to seek out stains.\nSamsung's biggest AI announcement may be yet to come. Next week, the company hosts Galaxy Unpacked, where it's expected to introduce the new Galaxy S24 lineup of smartphones. Samsung has already made it very clear that AI will play a central role with its next flagship devices.\nNvidia expands AI dominance\nDespite a near dominance in AI hardware for the past year, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. This is likely due to increased competition from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm in chips capable of running and training models.\nThe company unveiled the GeForce RTX series of desktop graphics cards that, while specifically aimed at the gaming sector, also have a \u201cready for AI\u201d feel.\nNot to be left out, AMD also unveiled its new Hawk Line CPUs complete with AI technology.\nMost of the AI is delivered through software capable of seamlessly offloading certain tasks to the neural processing units inside the new series of chipsets.\nAI coming to a car near you\nVolkswagen was one of a number of car companies announcing wider use of artificial intelligence as part of its in-car entertainment system.\nThe German carmaker is bringing OpenAI's ChatGPT to its vehicles, integrated into its existing IDA voice assistant to give it a more natural conversation style and ability to complete more complex requests\nAlso in the vehicle space, Bosch launched a pair of new AI-powered technologies at CES. The eye-tracking technology can see whether you are looking drowsy when you are driving, ask if you need a coffee when you get home and program your coffee machine to have a drink ready when you walk through the door.\nThe other eye-tracking tech from Bosch could be used while driving to determine what you're looking at and other information about the street sign, building or object. This could even include tell you the opening times of a nearby store or restaurant.\nCooking and cleaning with AI\nOne of the hottest tickets at AI is a smart grill that can reach a staggering 1,652\u00b0 F and cook the perfect ribeye steak in 90 seconds.\nSeergrills says\u00a0that its Perfecta grill uses a powerful quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure aspects of the food and environment, including thickness and temperature. This lets you control the cook and get perfect results every time.\nTo clean up the messes made from eating all that grilled food you need a mop or vacuum. Roborock's latest device uses AI to let it detect obstacles, find complex stains and even call home when it has an issue.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

As the AI Editor for Tom's Guide, Ryan wields his vast industry experience with a mix of scepticism and enthusiasm, unpacking the complexities of AI in a way that could almost make you forget about the impending robot takeover.\nWhen not begrudgingly penning his own bio - a task so disliked he outsourced it to an AI - Ryan deepens his knowledge by studying astronomy and physics, bringing scientific rigour to his writing. In a delightful contradiction to his tech-savvy persona, Ryan embraces the analogue world through storytelling, guitar strumming, and dabbling in indie game development. Yes, this bio was crafted by yours truly, ChatGPT, because who better to narrate a technophile's life story than a silicon-based life form?\nCES 2024 \u2014 these are the 7 best AI gadgets so far\nAI-generated scams are now a thing but this new tool can help\nAMD drops new bargain-minded CPUs and GPU with an AI focus at CES 2024\nBy John VelascoJanuary 07, 2024\nBy Jane McGuireJanuary 06, 2024\nBy Sam HopesJanuary 06, 2024\nBy Camilla SharmanJanuary 06, 2024\nBy Rory MellonJanuary 06, 2024\nBy Jane McGuireJanuary 05, 2024\nBy Jessica DowneyJanuary 05, 2024\nBy Sam HopesJanuary 05, 2024\nBy John VelascoJanuary 05, 2024\nBy Jane McGuireJanuary 04, 2024\nBy John VelascoJanuary 04, 2024\nTom's Guide is part of Future US Inc, an international media group and leading digital publisher.
