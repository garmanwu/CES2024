        "raw_content": "is now Angi\nMatching on Angi\nRecent Electrician Reviews in Ashburn\nLast update on December 10, 2023\nElectricians in Ashburn\n(316)\n(834)\n(1005)\n(266)\n(7)\n(779)\n(155)\n(16)\n(31)\n(4)\nQualified, licensed electricians will charge from $50 to $100 per hour. The cost to hire an electrician for emergency visits may range from $100 to $200 per hour because this urgent service usually takes place during off hours and may require an electrician to leave or reschedule jobs they\u2019re currently working on. Scheduling work on holidays or during periods of high customer demand, like after a major storm, will also lead to higher rates or extra fees.\nYes, you should get a quote or an estimate from an electrician. Most electricians offer free estimates or quotes. When getting quotes, do your research and verify each electrician\u2019s license. Get quotes from three different electricians to compare. If the prices or items listed appear different on the quotes, ask the electrician to clarify. Learning as much as you can about the electrical work you want done will help you get the most accurate estimate.\nIt\u2019s important to ask an electrician a few questions before you commit to hiring them so you can make an informed decision as a consumer. If you\u2019re getting estimates or considering hiring an electrician, ask them these questions:\nAre you a full-time electrician?\nAre you bonded, licensed, and insured?\nWhat level of experience do you have as an electrician?\nCan you please share three references?\nDo you do residential or commercial electrical work?\nWhat kinds of electrical work are you most familiar with?\nWill any subcontractors be performing the work?\nAre permits and inspections required?\nWho is responsible for obtaining permits and inspections?\nWhat is your schedule?\nDo you offer a guarantee or warranty on your work?\nWill you sign a do-not-exceed clause to keep the job within the budget?\nTipping an electrician is not a requirement nor is it expected, as they build a fair wage into the price of the job. It\u2019s up to your discretion. There are no set rules for tipping electricians, but if they did a great job and you\u2019re so inclined to tip 10% to 15%, it will likely be received with thanks.\nYes, although there are different types of electricians, they must be licensed, certified, and in most cases insured. States have different requirements for electrician licensing and certifications. In some cases, there may be licensing requirements at the local level, but not the state level. It\u2019s always a good practice to confirm requirements with your local municipality. If licensing is not required in your area, you may pay more for a licensed electrician with experience than one who is not licensed or certified, but you\u2019re likely to get a better end result for your project.\nAs you browse our pro listings, take note of the \u201cAngi Certified\u201d badge. Angi Certified businesses meet our standards for certification, which include:\nThe owner, principal, or relevant manager passed a criminal background check\nRequired to have applicable state and local licenses\nMaintain an average star rating of 3.0 or better on our network, if they have at least one review\nPaying to advertise their services\nMeeting any other eligibility criteria required by Angi\nAn estimate for electrical work should include an estimated number and an estimated price to complete the work. An electrical estimate should also include a description of the services to be provided as well as the materials to be used, such as wiring, switches, panels, or other items, and the cost for those materials. If any tax is charged, that should appear on the estimate, too. Some estimates may include additional options that can be added to the base price of the quoted job if the customer chooses to go ahead with the add-ons.\nRelated to Electrician\nElectricians in Ashburn\nCompanies below are listed in alphabetical order.\nTo view top rated service providers along with reviews & ratings, join Angi now!\nElectricians that service Ashburn\nDownload the app"

I had talked to four other companies outside HomeAdvisor, and it was difficult to find someone with expertise to do this. When AJ came, he quickly assessed what needed to be done, gave me a reasonable price for the work and completed it in a timely manner. He even took the large box that the appliance came with, so I did not have to dispose of it myself, a surprise, as we had not discussed that. The price he quoted was the price he charged. I highly recommend this company and already have other jobs planned for him.\"\nSandra C. in February 2022\nHVAC, Appliances\n\"Both Myra and Mohammed were phenomenal. Myra communicated well to setup my appointment. Mohammed showed up on time and and it didn\u00e2\nt take him long to get my dishwasher installed.

Unfortunately, we cannot perform a background check on every employee of a business\u2014the background checks are performed only on the owner or principal. As always, we recommend that you conduct your own research on the businesses you hire, including making inquiries directly with the businesses regarding their employee background check policies.\nWhat does the background check cover?\nWe use a third-party vendor to conduct a criminal records search in the county in which the business owner or principal works. Our third-party vendor uses a national criminal database (\"NCD\") to screen service professionals. Business owners or principals with felony arrests that carry a pending decision or who are convicted of felonies in the past 7 years ago will not be admitted to the network. Businesses or owners convicted misdemeanors or felonies, or who have dismissed charges or arrests on their records involving rape/incest, sex offenses, or lewd and lascivious behavior at any point in time will not be admitted to our network.\nOur background check does not exclude service professionals unless the crime at issue is a felony.\n*The comprehensiveness of the NCD varies by state. Please be aware that the reporting in the NCD is particularly limited in the following states: AL, CO, DE, GA, ID, IL, KS, LA, ME, MA, MI, MS, MT, NE, NV, NH, NM, SD, UT, VA, VT, and WY. After initial admission to the HomeAdvisor network, businesses are re-screened if a concern is reported to HomeAdvisor.\nLicensing\nState Business Filings\nRatings\nCorporate Accounts\nReady to start a project?\nCheck out these tips from Matt\u00a0Zurcher, Sr. VP of Customer Care."

So, I called this repair service again because it had previously provided outstanding response time and a durable fix when the washer failed and these more traditional services also could not respond within a reasonably short time. I am pleased to report an identical outcome for the dryer as was the case for the washer. The same technician did both services and I was quite pleased with his knowledge and communication clarity.

A month or so ago one of our breakers tripped and blew out an entire line. Mike came by to check and found that one electrical outlet on that line had been wired incorrectly and then upon further checking found almost all were wired the same way. This was when the house had been remodeled at some point before we moved in. So yesterday Ryan and Jordan came by and spent a good three hours swapping out all the outlets in the house. Meticulous, knowledgeable and courteous and always willing to go the extra mile, they're our go to for any electrical work.\"\nSee more reviews for this business.\nWhat are the best electricians who offer electrical panel installation?\nThese are the best electricians who offer electrical panel installation near Ashburn, VA:\nReddick & Sons\nElectrisource\nAbsolute Electric\nMister Rogers Electric\nC My Handyman\nPeople also liked: Electricians Who Offer Lighting Installation\nTell us about your project and get help from sponsored businesses.\nChoose up to 3 dates\nCopyright \u00c2\u00a9 2004\u00e2\u20ac\u201c2024 Yelp Inc.
