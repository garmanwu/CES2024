(stylized as c\u0101dence), headquartered in San Jose, California,[2] is an American multinational computational software company, founded in 1988 by the merger of SDA Systems and ECAD, Inc. The company produces software, hardware, and silicon structures[clarification needed] for designing integrated circuits, systems on chips (SoCs), and printed circuit boards.[3]\nHistory[edit]\nCadence Design Systems began as an electronic design automation (EDA) company, formed by the 1988 merger of Solomon Design Automation (SDA), co-founded in 1983 by Richard Newton, Alberto Sangiovanni-Vincentelli, and James Solomon, and ECAD, a public company co-founded by Ping Chao, Glen Antle, and Paul Huang in 1982. SDA's CEO Joseph Costello was appointed as CEO of the newly combined company.[4]\nFollowing the resignation of Cadence's original CEO Joe Costello in 1997, Jack Harding was appointed CEO.[5] Ray Bingham was named CEO in 1999.[6] In 2004, Mike Fister became Cadence's new CEO.[7]\nIn 2008, Cadence's board appointed Lip-Bu Tan as acting CEO, after the resignation of Mike Fister; Tan had served on the Cadence board of directors since 2004.[8] In January 2009, the board of directors of Cadence voted unanimously to confirm Lip-Bu Tan as president and CEO. Tan had been most recently CEO of Walden International, a venture capital firm, where he remains chairman of the firm.[9]\nIn April 2021, following a Washington Post report on the use of Cadence and Synopsys technology in the People's Liberation Army's military-civil fusion efforts,[10] U.S. legislators Michael McCaul and Tom Cotton requested that the United States Department of Commerce tighten controls on the sales of semiconductor manufacturing software.[11][12]\nOn December 15, 2021, Anirudh Devgan assumed the role of president & CEO, and Lip-Bu Tan became executive chairman. Devgan joined Cadence in 2012 and was appointed president in 2017.[13]\nProducts[edit]\nThe company develops software, hardware and intellectual property (IP) used to design chips,[14] systems and printed circuit boards.[15] Cadence also supplies IP covering interfaces, memory, analog, SoC peripherals, and data plane processing units, and develops chip verification technologies including simulators and formal verification tools.\nCustom IC technologies[edit]\nDigital implementation and signoff technologies[edit]\nOther Cadence RTL to GDS II tools: Conformal Equivalence Checker, Stratus High-Level Synthesis, Joules Power Analysis, Quantus RC Extraction, Modus AutomaticTest Pattern Generation.[citation needed]\nVerification technologies[edit]\nIntellectual property[edit]\nChip design IP targeting areas including memory/storage/high-performance interface protocols (USB or PCIe controllers and PHYs), Tensilica DSP processors for audio, vision, wireless modems, and convolutional neural nets. Tensilica DSP processors IP[43] include:\nTensilica Vision DSPs for Imaging, Vision, and AI processing;[44][45] Tensilica HiFi DSPs for Audio/Voice/Speech processing;[46][47] Tensilica Fusion DSPs for IoT;[48] Tensilica ConnX DSPs for Radar, Lidar, and Communications processing;[49][50] and Tensilica DNA Processor Family for AI acceleration[51][52]\nIn 2021, Cadence launched the Tensilica AI Platform to accelerate AI SoC development and improve power, performance, and area\u2014targeting mobile, IoT, automotive, intelligent sensor, and industrial AI SoC designs.[53]\nPCB and packaging technologies[edit]\nSystem analysis[edit]\nRecognition[edit]\nIn 2016, Cadence CEO Lip-Bu Tan was awarded the Dr. Morris Chang Exemplary Leadership Award by the Global Semiconductor Alliance.[63]\nIn 2019, Investor's Business Daily ranked Cadence Design Systems #5 on its 50 Best Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) Companies list.[64]\nIn 2020, Fortune Magazine named Cadence to Fortune's \"100 Best Companies to Work For list\" for the sixth consecutive year.[65]\nAlso in 2020, Cadence was ranked #45 in PEOPLE magazine's Companies that Care.[66]\nSponsorship[edit]\nIn May 2022, McLaren announced a multi-year partnership deal with Cadence.[67]\nAcquisitions[edit]\nTimeline[edit]\nThe company has also acquired High-Level Design (HLD), UniCAD, CadMOS, Ambit Design Systems, Simplex, Silicon Perspective, Plato, and Get2Chip.\nRelated[edit]\nLawsuits[edit]\nNotable persons[edit]\nSee also[edit]\nReferences[edit]\nExternal links[edit]"

This new platform features seamless integration with other Cadence solutions, including the Cadence Spectre\u00ae Simulation Platform, Cadence Allegro\u00ae PCB Design and Cadence Pegasus\u2122 Verification System, removing traditional barriers between different design domains and speeding design closure. Virtuoso Studio is newly integrated with the AWR\u00ae Microwave Office\u00ae solution, and the Pegasus Design Rule Check (DRC) Solution and Layout Versus Schematic (LVS) Solution are now available from within the Virtuoso Layout Suite. These provide advanced mmWave design and interactive signoff quality analysis during layout creation. Additionally, customers can access the Spectre Simulation Platform, including the Spectre X Simulator and Spectre FX Simulator, through Virtuoso Studio, which allows for the analysis of the industry\u2019s largest analog and mixed-signal designs.\nThe new Virtuoso Studio platform offers customers the same great experience they are accustomed to, with the following benefits to address growing complexity:\nProven Solution: Virtuoso Studio continues to offer the secure, proven solutions that industry-leading companies and foundries have trusted for 30 years for their analog, RFIC and mixed-signal designs.\nImproved Productivity: Design teams can leverage comprehensive planar and FinFET-based layout placement automation and new routing solutions to improve engineering productivity.\nCloud-Ready: Virtuoso Studio offers massively scalable, cloud-ready solutions for occurrences when hundreds of simulations turn into thousands. It is optimized for customers\u2019 preferred cloud providers or ready for private cloud deployment.\nGenerative AI for Design Migration: The foundry-supported solutions ease the burden of process migration for schematics and layouts. Tools within the Virtuoso ADE Suite quickly re-center and validate designs post-migration, so customers can achieve aggressive time-to-market goals. Customers can utilize the AI-enabled tools to take existing IP and transform it for their next-generation designs.\n3D-IC Integration: Virtuoso Studio allows the heterogeneous integration of 2.5D and 3D designs for advanced nodes, analog/RF packaging/modules and photonics systems.\nVirtuoso Studio stays at the forefront of delivering designs accurately and on time through innovative improvements in traditional custom design tools. The new Design Space Optimization feature lets customers utilize AI algorithms to navigate competing specifications and aid in design centering, particularly after the process migration of a design. Customers can experience faster interactive editing in both the layout and schematic tools, thanks to optimized code and algorithms, while multi-threading accelerates rendering, connectivity extraction and design rule checks in parallel. Additionally, the Cadence Spectre FMC Analysis is integrated into Virtuoso Studio and provides a complete machine learning (ML)-based Monte Carlo variation solution to deliver a 3-to-6-sigma yield with orders of magnitude speedup over brute force Monte Carlo analysis.\n\"Cadence continues its commitment to providing customers with the most comprehensive set of integrated tools and solutions that make it simpler for our customers to design and verify emerging heterogeneous systems,\" said Tom Beckley, senior vice president and general manager, Custom IC & PCB Group at Cadence. \"Virtuoso Studio sets the new industry standard for doing analog, mixed-signal, RF and photonics design. Customers get access to the same Virtuoso experience they are accustomed to with improvements that address the latest design challenges.\"\nVirtuoso Studio supports Cadence\u2019s Intelligent System Design\u2122 strategy enabling SoC design excellence.
