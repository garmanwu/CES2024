The company offers sustainable solutions that improve the energy and management capacity of companies. It provides solutions for energy self-production with high-tech gas turbines for electricity and heat production. It was founded in 2000 and is based in Klagenfurt am Worthersee, Austria.\nTelesensors is an electronics engineering design firm that provides product design and development, project management, and manufacturing services. It specializes in wireless design services, sensor integration, and energy/power management. It was founded in 2003 and is based in Knoxville, Tennessee.\nPEMF Systems is a company that specializes in the production of Pulsed Electro-Magnetic Field (PEMF) devices, operating within the medical device industry. The company's main products are magnetic pulse generators, which are used for therapeutic purposes such as improving blood circulation, muscle relaxation, and pain relief. The primary market for these products is the healthcare sector. It was founded in 2000 and is based in Los Angeles, California.\nPeregrine Power is a company that received a SBIR Phase I grant for a project entitled: Universal Utility/Customer Interface. Their research project will lead to an electrical panel with modules that provide interfaces between the electrical grid and the residential customer's on-site loads and other energy systems. Through the use of interactive solid state meters, the utility will be able to intelligently regulate loads and dispatch on-site energy systems. The on-site energy systems include, but are not limited to, controlled loads (e.g., water heating), pluggable EVs, generation systems (e.g., PV panels), and energy storage (e.g., spent EV batteries). The panel and modules represent the most integrated and economic system attempted so far to enable more intelligent energy management and will encourage renewable energy and conservation. In addition, new grid stabilization opportunities will be created for the utility. The proposed approach will use advanced power electronics, along with state-of-the-art communications techniques. The broader impacts of this research are (1) to enable utilities and over 50,000,000 residential customers to implement safe, convenient and economic energy management techniques, (2) to encourage renewable energy, and (3) to provide distributed generation and storage systems that assist the utility in stabilizing the grid. This would lead to more reliable and less costly energy for the customer, along with reduced greenhouse gas.\nLawrenceville Plasma Physics (LPP) is conducting peer-reviewed research into a low-cost nuclear fusion generator that would provide clean, abundant and safe electricity to a worldwide market.\nOur patented technology combines a device called the dense plasma focus and the advanced fusion fuel hydrogen and boron-11 (p-B11) in an approach we call \"Focus Fusion.\"\nUpon demonstration of scientific feasibility in 2011, we anticipate a clear engineering path towards the commercialization of what will amount to unlimited energy with no radioactive waste.\nIn addition to valuable spin-off applications in non-destructive inspection and medical isotopes, LPPs commercial product will be compact, mass-manufactured 5 MW generators with costs less than any competing energy source.\nIn 2009 LPP was granted US Patent #7,482,607, \"Method and apparatus for producing X-rays, ion beams and nuclear fusion energy,\" with international patents filed, in support of our Focus Fusion technology.\nLPP has met with and expects NJs Board of Public Utilities and Department of Environmental Protection to declare that Focus Fusion is an Approved Alternative Technology for Class I Renewable Energy.\nEngineering estimates project the cost of a 5 MW generator at around $300,000, with minimal maintenance costs and hydrogen-boron fuel requirements of only a kilogram per megawatt-year.\nTherefore, installation costs will be about $60/kW, and generation costs are estimated at about two tenths of a cent per kWh, many times cheaper than current costs.\nLoading...\nAbout\nHow We Help\nWhat We Offer\nPopular Research\nCopyright 2024 CB Information Services, Inc.
