Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\nFollowing the landmark over-the-counter hearing aid legislation passed in 2022, consumers have easier access to dozens of options to ameliorate mind-to-moderate hearing loss. We\u2019ve tested many different hearing solutions over the past year, but as expected, the show floor at CES 2024 will be full of innovative alternatives that may very well shape our review calendar in the months ahead.\nFrom super-customizable hearing aids to wearable caption glasses, here are six of the coolest hearing innovations being showcased at CES 2024.\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\n1. XanderGlasses\nThe Xander Captioning Glasses offer an innovative, hands-free way for people with hearing loss to follow conversations.\nXanderGlasses are a Reviewed AccessABILITY Award winner in 2024, and we\u2019re especially excited to learn initial shipments will be in consumers\u2019 hands as soon as this month. Diverging from the hearing aid path altogether, XanderGlasses are a pair of self-captioning eyewear.\nWhether watching TV or making conversation in a crowded restaurant, captions of the spoken word appear right in front of the wearer\u2019s face for easy reading through Vuzix augmented reality technology.\nA single pair costs $4,999, including all the cables, cases, and maintenance supplies you need. For techies who want to try a unique way to solve an age-old problem, Xander offers an interesting opportunity.\n2. ClearSense Audio\nThe CleanSense Audio app subscription is $3 a month.\nFor those feeling a bit of sticker shock from the price of XanderGlasses or over-the-counter hearing aids, ClearSense Audio may offer a more approachable solution. Priced at just $3 per month, this intuitive smartphone app selectively reduces environmental noise by about 25 dB to maximize clarity of sound.\nThe app functions well with standard headphones or Bluetooth hearing aids, lowering the barrier to entry considerably. Especially for those who may be shy about using assistive devices, this software-based solution helps in whatever form factor the user chooses.\nWe tested a beta version of ClearSense Audio and liked it enough to honor it with a 2024 AccessABILITY Award.\n3. Amadeus Powered By Absolute Audio Labs\nThe Amadeus Powered By Absolute Audio Labs is set to debut as an OTC hearing aid in Q2 2024.\nUnderstanding speech is hugely important to those with hearing loss. That\u2019s precisely why so many hearing aid manufacturers target their tech to offer the best speech quality possible.\nThe Amadeus Receiver-in-Canal hearing aid takes a different route by offering a system on a chip not unlike the ones powering high-quality music earbuds. This distinction, its tech partners at Absolute Audio Labs suggest, offers the \u201cbest of both worlds\u201d in producing excellent speech and music quality alike.\nThis product is expected to make its debut as an OTC hearing aid in Q2 2024.\n4. Concha Labs hearing aids\nConcha Labs hearing aids have not been FDA approved yet in the United States.\nWhile Concha Labs hearing aids must be FDA approved before being sold in the United States, the combined technology and discreet profile of this product presents some exciting possibilities.\nNot only is the lineup sold to blend into four different skin tones, but it also features patented Soundscope technology that allows users to create a series of hearing profiles to match specific situations. Many similar hearing aids have preset sound profiles, but this is the most emphasis we\u2019ve seen on actually making your own.\n5. BeAware Conference Live Captioning V4\nScan the QR code t0 download the BeAware Conference Live Captioning V4 smartphone app.\nConferences and convention halls often aren\u2019t overly accessible for attendees who may be deaf or hard of hearing. BeAware Conference Live Captioning is a free app that allows conference speakers to auto-generate caption streams that can be quickly accessed by anyone in the area.\nHosts simply start and name a stream using the app, and then tap a button to start a caption stream. That stream can be found by others on the app via the provided name. This free app is more suitable for larger clients than individual consumers, but it\u2019s still an inventive and necessary hearing solution.\n6. Clearcast\nThe Clearcast is great for on the go.\nNot quite a hearing aid, ClearCast is the first new FDA-registered Assistive Listening Device since 2004. This product is meant for those who need occasional hearing help in certain situations. Just slip on the neckband, pop in the included earbuds, and you can be hearing conversations and voice with a greatly improved signal-to-noise ratio.\nFor those with more substantial hearing loss, an external microphone can be placed closer to the source of the desired sound.\nRelated content\nPrices were accurate at the time this article was published but may change over time.\nThe product experts at Reviewed\nhave all your shopping needs covered.\nFollow Reviewed on Facebook,\nTwitter,\nInstagram,\nTikTok,\nor Flipboard for the latest deals, product reviews, and more.\nUp next\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\n\u00a92024 Reviewed, a division of Gannett Satellite Information Network LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n7 best audio products at CES 2024\nMy pick of the top audio highlights to look out for in the year ahead\nCES 2024 may be wrapping up, but this year's event has been an amazing insight into what to expect in the world of consumer tech for the year ahead. The five-day monster Consumer Electronics Show held in Las Vegas allows tech industry visitors to gaze into future development plans from all kinds of tech companies ahead of the official product releases.\nSo far this year we've seen some remarkable tech developments. From massive strides in the world of display technology to artificial intelligence and the robotic invasion that's expected to take over our homes, gardens and workspaces over the next 12 months. More excitingly for me as audio editor though, is the riot of new audio products on the horizon, from the mind-blowing $750,000 (no, that's not a typo) Sonus faber Suprema speaker system, to the latest products helping to streamline our audio setups and deliver the highest quality listening experiences.\nHere's a rundown of my favorite audio picks announced at CES 2024 set to energize our ears with great sound in the year ahead.\nLuxury speaker system\nSonus faber Suprema\nPriced at\u00a0$750,000 / \u00a3695,000 / AU$1,119,980 for the full loudspeaker system, these are without exception the most expensive speaker system I've ever seen. Announced by luxury Italian loudspeaker specialist Sonus faber at CES 2024, they're easily one of the most expensive products at the Las Vegas event, and the new Suprema embodies the height of luxury and the ultimate experience for audio and design enthusiasts.\nTom's Guide readers will already know of the sumptuous $1,999 Omnia wireless speaker system, one of the best one-box music systems available. But by some margin, this is the high-end speaker company's most ambitious project ever.\nBuilt to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, the Suprema demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship.\nThe lavish Suprema speaker system is built to celebrate the company's 40th anniversary, and demonstrates Sonus faber's dedication to unparalleled audio excellence and meticulous craftsmanship using luxurious materials including carbon fiber,\u00a0wood,\u00a0solid aluminum, and genuine Italian leather.\nThe Suprema system features 2 main lute-shaped columns weighing in at 242.5 pounds each (around 110kg) configured as a 4/5-way system\u00a0with\u00a08 front-firing speakers plus 2 back-firing drivers. The full Suprema system's matching elliptical subwoofers weigh 227 pounds (around 103kg) each. They are fitted with 2 powerful 15-inch (38cm) transducers\u00a0featuring forged carbon fiber membranes and\u00a0a neodymium magnet motor system\u00a0to ensure it delivers powerful bass notes down to 16Hz.\nLastly, the dual mono and fully balanced electronic crossover manages the integration between the Suprema main columns and subwoofers and offers\u00a0versatility while maintaining the maximum integrity of the audio signal.\nIf you have pockets (or a bank vault) deep enough, the remarkable Suprema speaker system is produced on request and available to order from the Sonus faber website.\nBest desktop audio solution\nFiiO R9\nAlthough FiiO launched several new products at CES 2024, the most eye-catching is the flagship R9 desktop streamer and headphone amp/DAC. Aimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices, including wired and wireless headphones, active speakers, smartphones and PCs.\nIt supports 6.35mm and balanced 4.4mm wired headphones connections and there's a balanced 4-pin XLR output. With a power output of up to 7300mW, FiiO says that the R9 is capable of driving both low-and high-impedance headphones.\nAround the back, there's an HDMI ARC port, SD and USB ports, plus optical, coaxial, and ethernet inputs, with the FiiO R9 also supports 2.4GHz/5GHz Wi-Fi and has Bluetooth 5.0 on board with support for high-quality codec including aptX HD and LDAC.\nAimed at streamlining your digital music and connectivity for home desk jockeys like myself, the FiiO R9 has been designed to work with a host of devices.\nWith 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DACs, the FiiO R9 is equipped to handle full hi-res PCM audio files up to 32-bit/768kHz, native DSD512, and features MQA decoding. The 64GB of onboard storage is expandable to 2TB via SD card, meaning your personal collection of audio files can be played back using the FiiO Music app. Streaming applications for all the best music streaming services (and more) can be downloaded and installed via either the Google Play Store or FiiO Store apps to deliver audio in its native quality.\nThe Full-HD 6-inch color touchscreen display on front is designed to provide easy system navigation, and the R9 comes supplied with a Bluetooth remote control too.\nThe FiiO R9 will be available from mid-January, priced at $1,499 / \u00a31,399 (around AU$2,239). For more information head to the FiiO website.\nBest soundbar audio partnership\nKlipsch Flexus series\nSpeaker specialist Klipsch and AV amp maker Onkyo unveiled a surprising partnership at CES 2024 with Klipsch's new Flexus series of soundbars, subwoofers and satellite speakers. The new lineup includes the Flexus Core 100 ($299) and 200 ($499) soundbars as well as the Sub 100 subwoofer and Surr 100 surrounds.\nOnkyo is probably most frequently associated with some of the best AV receivers that use power amplifiers and surround-sound decoders, both of which are crucial for soundbars.\u00a0According to a Klipsch representative, \"all of the non-passive components\" \u2014 amp included \u2014 are made by Onkyo, which bodes well for integrated speakers systems and quality control thanks to the company's technical know-how.\nThe Flexus series of products are due out by April with further innovations to the lineup coming sometime in the future. Read the full Klipsch Flexus story on their debut at\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0and what we made of the new series during a private listening demo.\nBest home cinema speaker series\nFocal Aria Evo X series\nPriced a little less lofty than Sonus faber's made-to-order Suprema loudspeaker system (top), French audio specialist, Focal, unveiled new iterations of its Aria series speakers earlier this week at CES 2024. They're still high-end though compared to majority of the best Bluetooth speakers we cover at Tom's Guide, and the updated series builds on the original Aria 900 passive loudspeaker series launched in 2013.\nThe new Focal Aria Evo X collection consists of five speakers designed for both music and home cinema, making them ideal options for the best AV receivers, although there's no mention of Dolby Atmos height speakers. The new series of speaker models includes the Aria Evo X N\u00b01 ($2,398 / \u00a31,299) compact bookshelf speaker, Aria Evo X N\u00b02 ($4,798 / \u00a32,999), N\u00b03 ($5,198 / \u00a33,499 ), N\u00b04 ($5,998 / \u00a33,999) floorstanding speakers, and Aria Evo X ($999\u00a0/ \u00a3699) center speaker.\nAs you'd expect from any new loudspeaker series, the next-gen Evo X incorporates sonic improvements said to upgrade performance including a woofer redesign for more powerful lows. The new line\u2019s midrange and bass speaker drivers are all made from Focal\u2019s iconic flax cone said to achieve a natural sound and a rich, immersive listening experience, and includes that \u2018M\u2019-shaped inverted dome tweeter for extended high frequency performance.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X speaker range is available already in black high gloss, walnut and moss green high gloss finishes. More information can be found at the Focal website and via specialist dealers.\nBest wireless streaming turntable\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nThe new Victrola Stream Sapphire record player comes with a modern day tech twist that offers better-than-Bluetooth wireless integration with high-quality vinyl playback to wirelessly connected speakers and devices over Wi-Fi. It looks like an ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience, as well as possibly enticing a few vinyl fans to return to the format, too.\nBuilding on the DNA of its flagship\u00a0Stream Carbon\u00a0turntable, the Victrola Stream Sapphire includes multiple wireless connectivity options (as well as wired Ethernet connectivity) \u2014 all controlled via the Victrola app. There's the ability to stream vinyl to a Sonos speaker or multiple Sonos speakers simultaneously around the home. You can also opt to stream to UPnP networked devices such as\u00a0KEF's LSX II Wireless\u00a0Hi-Fi speakers (pictured) and Roon systems (a music management solution that integrates networked storage devices and music streaming service to connect via AirPlay, Chromecast, and Roon Ready connectivity) with support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nAn ingenuous solution that will further the joy of playing records to a whole new audience.\nDespite offering comprehensive wireless connectivity, there are also RCA outputs at the back that allow you to connect the Victrola to wired systems or powered speakers. The Stream Sapphire turntable has a traditional MDF plinth with walnut veneer and is fitted with adjustable-height aluminum feet with vibration isolation. There's an upgraded motor design, too, that powers the belt-driven record platter. A carbon-fiber tonearm with removable head shell and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge (worth $240) complete this turntable's audiophile credentials.\nVictrola says that the Stream Sapphire is for the vinyl lover seeking more options for high-quality wireless audio fused with beautiful design and premium components. It's expected to sell for $1,499 (around \u00a31,180 / AU$2,800) when it goes on sale in spring 2024 at\u00a0Victrola.com.\nBest wireless earbuds with audiophile sound\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nSennheiser unveiled three new products at CES 2024, but the most interesting to audiophiles like myself is the Momentum True Wireless 4. The new premium earbuds will bring the popular series bang up to date for 2024 with stacks of new features and audio enhancements incorporated into a slightly smaller design. Sennheiser bills the new version as its most capable earbuds yet, and from what I've seen, they could easily be set to rank among our\u00a0best audiophile headphones\u00a0of 2024.\nWith improved connectivity that's built on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology with aptX lossless sound quality and ultra-low latency, the new flagship will be able to stream music at higher quality via compatible devices, beating the AirPods Pro 2 in the race to lossless audio. There's Auracast support too, along with improved Adaptive ANC, evolved signature sound tuning, and an upgraded battery system. Plus, there's a Qi charging case and quick charging over USB-C.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds are expected to be available to pre-order from the\u00a0Sennheiser website\u00a0from next month, and will cost $299 / \u00a3259 (approx. AU$499).\nBest bone-conduction headphones\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra\nStraddling the line between audio, fitness and AI verticals, the Mojawa's HaptiFit Terra is an integrated smart sports device that combines haptic technology, bone conduction audio and AI Sports Trainer. As someone who's always listening to a motivational playlist when training at the gym, this Mojawa could help fitness fans to the next level.\nAlthough I haven't managed to try them out just yet, I am intrigued by Mojawa\u2019s claims that the HaptiFit Terra delivers a first-of-its-kind integrated smart sport experience for athletes to up their game, shifting fitness tracking from post-workout to real-time. The over-ear design is said to be lightweight and comfortable, providing dynamic sound and sports tracking. Mojawa says: \"The audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals with insights such as heart rate, pace, step count, calories, swimming lap and distance, and more for users to adjust their speed, set new personal records, and achieve more.\"\nThe audio-haptic interaction enables runners, swimmers, and cyclists to improve on and crush their fitness goals.\nLike the new Shokz OpenSwim Pro that I mentioned in my best headphones and earbuds at CES 2024, the Mojawa connects via Bluetooth and has 32GB of storage so users can train without their phone, and it's protected to IP68 making it a useful all-in-one option for swimmers. Battery life runs to 8 hours and recharges are said to complete in just one hour.\nThe Mojawa HaptiFit Terra will be available in March for $299 and is available for pre-order now via the Mojawa website with $100 off.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: What\u2019s New in Hearing Aids, Hearables, and Hearing Healthcare Tech\nThe Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas is expected to be attended by about 130,000 people, with more than 4,000 exhibitors and 1,200 start-up companies across 2.5 million square feet of exhibit space. This 2023 photo shows the entrance to Eureka Park which is a hotbed for seeing startups and new ideas, along with innovations often grouped into countries or regions from around the world.\nCES never disappoints when it comes to new ideas in technology. The annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas on January 9-12 will showcase new hearing devices and hearing-related technology. Over the past three years, over-the-counter (OTC) aids, captioning glasses, and innovations in hearables, processing strategies, sensors for health and fitness monitoring, and components have taken the stage of the CES show floor.\nThis year, there are dozens of new and established companies with products at CES 2024 that will doubtlessly impact the future of hearing care. Below is a quick overview of what we think are some of the most exciting technologies featured at this year\u2019s expo. Stay tuned to HearingTracker for more about their innovations.\nOTC Hearing Aids and Hearables\nConcha Labs receiver-in-canal (RIC) hearing aid.\nConcha Labs is unveiling an OTC hearing aid with hearing personalization technology called Soundscope to help people hear more clearly. Amy Li, who has a bioengineering degree from UC Berkeley and worked at Eargo, heads the company. Currently, only a little information is available about the product. Concha\u2019s website shows receiver-in-canal (RIC) hearing aids and addresses the need to \u201chelp users control their hearing settings from their phone, anytime, anywhere.\u201d We expect more information to come soon! For details, visit the Concha Labs website. See it at: Venetian Expo, Eureka Park, Hall G, Booth #60448.\nELEHEAR reports it uses the \u201cgroundbreaking voClear technology platform\u201d that uses Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms trained with 18 million scenarios. The product is an FDA-registered OTC hearing aid that features rechargeability (up to 20 hours of use, with an extra 7 charges from the Premium charging case), Bluetooth streaming for iOS and Android, and a 32 kHz high-definition sampling rate and directional microphones. The company\u2019s Alpha Pro OTC hearing aids are offered now on the company\u2019s website for $699 (discounted from $999). See it at: LVCC, North Hall, Booth #8137.\nELEHEAR launched its AI-powered hearing aids and audio solutions in September, introducing the ELEHEAR Alpha and ELEHEAR Alpha Pro.\nNuheara is the Australia-based maker of the HP Pro OTC hearing aid, Nuheara IQBuds2 MAX hearable, and IQstream TV listening system. HearingTracker has consistently cited IQBuds2 MAX as one of the best values in hearables and personal sound amplification products (PSAPs). And, like the MAX, HP Pro uses Nuheara's Ear ID\u2122\u00a0system to automatically calibrate the devices to your individual hearing configuration; the HP Hearing App measures your hearing thresholds for both ears in just 10 minutes or less. The hearing aid is Bluetooth-compatible with both iOS and Android. See it at: LVCC North Hall, Booth #8425.\nNuHeara's 2023 exhibit booth displaying the HP Pro OTC hearing aid.\nSwitzerland-based Sonova, the world\u2019s largest hearing aid manufacturer and parent company to Phonak and Unitron hearing aid brands, is showcasing its Sennheiser headphones and hearables, as well as enhanced hearing solutions and soundbars for audiophiles at CES 2024.

Additionally, Alango offers advanced technological solutions for hearing enhancement and personalizing sound. At CES 2024, see Alango's technologies for hearing enhancement including its patent-pending user's own voice attenuation, external sound acquisition for cars that can help alert people with hearing loss to emergency vehicles while driving, and sound personalization including experiencing a real-time hearing loss simulator that allows hearing loss experience of different levels and audiometric configurations. See it at: Flamingo Suite and Knowles Venetian Resort, Toscana Suite #3805.\nAlango is showing its variety of assistive devices and technologies at CES 2024.\nHard of hearing and deaf e-gamers can now visualize key sounds like footsteps and alerts with Audio Radar, a product from Airdrop Gaming designed to transform game sounds into audio signals. It visualizes directional game audio events and is reportedly easy to use, with plug-and-play compatibility and customizable features like sensitivity and light behavior. It\u2019s a versatile addition to any gaming setup; the product is designed to work with Xbox, PlayStation, and PC, making games more accessible and enjoyable for all. See it at: Venetian Expo, Eureka Park, Booth #60704.\nAudio Radar helps level the playing field for e-gamers by providing them with directional cues about the sound in the game.\nBeAware, the creator of free and fast transcription apps for people who are deaf and hard of hearing, is launching two new apps at\u00a0CES\u00a02024. The BeAware Conference Captioning app is designed to provide Deaf and hard-of-hearing people with quick accessibility to any in-person event within 15 seconds for real-time captioning for speeches, live events, press conferences, and trade shows.\u00a0Event organizers can capture live transcriptions, allowing\u00a0Deaf\u00a0attendees to stream captions in real-time on their smartphones, ensuring an inclusive experience for all participants\u2014especially important for emergency press conferences\u00a0and alerts.\nHealthScribe is a tool used in hospital emergency rooms to provide offline fast and privacy-safe live transcriptions for Deaf and hard-of-hearing patients, as well as translations for patients with limited English proficiency (LEP). The live transcriptions and translations are available while the patient is offline, making it ideal for geriatric hospitals and medical institutions with a diverse patient language base.\u00a0It\u2019s free for patients, and licensed and paid by hospitals depending on the implementation scale.\u00a0See it at: Venetian Expo, Eureka Park, Hall G, Booth 60464.\nPriced at $3 per month, ClearSense is a noise-canceling app that improves hearing in noisy environments for many users. Using a smartphone and earphones, it has been developed as a cost-effective substitute for pricier professional hearing aids and uses Korea-headquartered mpWAV\u2019s technology for noise reduction without distorting target sounds, says the company. See it at: Venetian Expo, Eureka Park, Hall G, Booth #62813.\nYouTube video featuring ClearSense app.\nSound Oasis has developed and marketed a wide variety of tinnitus remediation and sound therapy machines for people dealing with tinnitus, insomnia, stress, and a variety of chronic health issues.

KG (Sennheiser). The Sennheiser Consumer Division, which concentrates on the business of headphones and hearables for private customers, is an excellent fit with Sonova\u2019s strategy to lead innovation in hearing experience and to engage consumers early on their hearing journey. The strength of the brand and the well-established complementary distribution network of the Sennheiser Consumer Division represent strong assets to further the strategy of Sonova. The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and expected to close in the second half of calendar year 2021.\nHighlights:\nArnd Kaldowski, CEO of Sonova, says: \u201cI am very pleased that Sennheiser has chosen Sonova to further develop the well-renowned Consumer Division. We look forward to welcoming our new colleagues and to building on the combined strengths of both organizations to successfully shape our joint future. The fast-growing market for personal audio devices is rapidly evolving. Combining our audiological expertise with Sennheiser\u2019s know-how in sound delivery, their great reputation as well as their high-quality products will allow us to expand our offering and to create important touchpoints with consumers earlier in their hearing journey. Combining our market-leading technology with the strong brand and well-established distribution network of Sennheiser creates a strong foundation for future growth.\u201d\n\"We couldn't have asked for a better partner than Sonova for our Consumer Division,\" says Daniel Sennheiser, co-CEO at Sennheiser. \"Sonova is a strong, well-positioned company. Not only do we share a passion for unique audio experiences, we also share very similar corporate values. This gives us an excellent foundation for a successful future together.\" Co-CEO Dr. Andreas Sennheiser adds: \"The combination of our strengths provides a very good starting point for future growth. We are convinced that Sonova will strengthen the Sennheiser Consumer Division in the long term and capture the major growth opportunities.\"\nSennheiser\u2019s portfolio of personal audio devices fits well with Sonova\u2019s vision to foster a world where everyone can enjoy the delight of hearing. Sennheiser stands for extraordinary sound and a unique audio experience \u2013 always tailored to the needs of its customers. The strong product offering of its Consumer Division includes premium headphones \u2013 especially in the True Wireless segment \u2013 as well as audiophile headphones, enhanced hearing solutions and soundbars. They are sold through a well-established complementary distribution network by Sennheiser\u2019s own subsidiaries and long-established trading partners in more than 50 countries, both online and in-store, further expanding Sonova\u2019s channel presence and customer base.\nThis acquisition supports an important element of Sonova\u2019s strategy \u2013 to reach ever more consumers, wherever their journey towards better hearing begins. Personal audio devices have become an integral part of everyday life as people interact with their digital devices increasingly through sound. As hearing loss occurs in most cases as a normal part of ageing, first remedial steps may include non-medical solutions to enhance hearing in specific situations. Sonova believes that such complementary solutions will ultimately expand the traditional hearing aid market by increasing adoption rates. The acquisition significantly accelerates Sonova\u2019s own efforts in this area.\nThe purchase price for the Sennheiser Consumer Division amounts to EUR 200 million, which will be financed through the existing cash balance. A licensing agreement on customary terms for the Sennheiser brand will be in place in perpetuity. The deal is expected to be EPS accretive immediately. Closing is foreseen in the second half of 2021 after obtaining the relevant regulatory approvals.\nSonova was advised by Goldman Sachs International, Fieldfisher, and KPMG.\nAbout Sennheiser\nFounded in 1945, Sennheiser is one of the world\u2019s leading manufacturers of headphones, microphones and wireless transmission systems.

Our strategic product priorities include a focus on the premium audiophile segment, building on Sennheiser\u02bcs strong brand and state-of-the-art transducer technology; extending our offering in premium True Wireless in-ear headphones that match superior sound quality with custom fit and sensor expertise; and shaping the emerging consumer hearing market with early-entry hearing solutions that bridge the gap between audio products and hearing aids.\nThe acquisition of the Sennheiser Consumer Division closed in March 2022, and since then the transition into a combined business has proceeded quickly and smoothly. The joint senior leadership team is in place and has successfully integrated our teams supporting consumer hearing solutions in product development, operations, and sales organizations worldwide. Sonova\u02bcs vision and culture have proven to be a close and natural fit with the Sennheiser brand and people. The Sonova X business system of continuous improvement, including process optimization, lean manufacturing, and growth tools, has started to generate meaningful productivity gains, supporting our planned margin expansion for the Consumer Hearing business.\nA combined innovation roadmap has generated an impressive 12 product launches in this financial year, four of which represent significant steps forward in key business areas and are described below. Despite global supply chain challenges shared with other electronics industries at the beginning of the year, all Consumer Hearing products are fully available in all significant markets, and sales have grown year-on-year well beyond the consumer audio industry growth average. This outperformance is due both to our innovative product portfolio and to our emphasis on high growth sales channels and regions.\nSTRATEGY AND BUSINESSES\nAmong the seven strategic initiatives defined by the Consumer Hearing team, three focus on our go-to-market priorities, aiming to secure the advantages that have helped to generate this year\u02bcs sales performance. We aim to increase the proportion of online sales from 50% to 75% over time, allowing us to get ever closer to our consumers and control our brand and pricing destinies. We are investing in data analytics and CRM automation to optimize our digital marketing, performance insights, and digital consumer experience, extending each contact into a full hearing journey. We are also continuing to build our audiophile leadership positions in key growth markets, specifically the US and China, increasing brand awareness along with our online sales activities.\nOur consumers, like us, take sound seriously: they expect each new Sennheiser branded product to extend the boundaries of their audio experience. The market response to our product launches in this financial year \u2013 covering all our strategic product categories \u2013 shows that we have achieved this goal.\nIn True Wireless, a particularly high-growth segment, we introduced in April 2022 the MOMENTUM True Wireless 3 earbuds, which set new standards for sound quality, adaptive noise cancelation, and wearing comfort \u2013 along with long battery life, wireless charging, and a splash-resistant design that makes them the perfect companion for an active life. They are rated \u201cBest True Wireless Headphones\u201d by Trusted Reviews and have boosted our share of the True Wireless market in all key countries.\nThe MOMENTUM 4 wireless noise-canceling headband headphones, launched in August 2022, are an audiophile\u02bcs dream, defining \u2013 once again \u2013 the standard for sophisticated listening with superior sound. An entire acoustic system in a compact, beautifully-designed package, they feature brilliant dynamics and clarity, user-controllable sound modes, supreme comfort, and effortless phone and voice assistant interaction, coupled with an unprecedented battery life of more than 60 hours. The audiophile press regularly rates them as top in their class.\nOur AMBEO soundbar range harnesses sophisticated signal processing and self-calibration to create the sensation of a vast 3D soundscape in a compact package, turning the smallest room into a concert hall, a stadium \u2013 or a savannah. Launched in October 2022, the AMBEO Soundbar Plus and AMBEO Sub extend this remarkable performance in two directions: a smaller format and, thanks to the AMBEO Sub\u02bcs clear and powerful bass response, a deep and immersive sound experience \u201cdesigned to give you goosebumps.\u201d\nThe first Sonova-developed product launched under the Sennheiser brand was the TV Clear Set, which reached the market in May 2022. Building on Sennheiser\u02bcs leading position in the television listener market, TV Clear Set adds enhanced speech clarity, easy connectivity with multiple devices, extra wearing comfort, and a straightforward but powerful app that allows users to personalize their experience.\nWatching television, however, is only one situation where enhanced speech clarity can enrich the consumer\u02bcs sound world. We therefore launched in January 2023 our first speech-enhanced hearable device: the Sennheiser Conversation Clear Plus. These compact earbuds establish a new category of early entry hearing solutions: devices that support and enhance hearing in specific situations, such as busy restaurants or noisy worksites, while at the same time providing an excellent sound experience. They can be used whenever the user wants to enjoy effortless clear conversations, by detecting and analyzing the sound scene, adjusting their response, and activating adaptive noise cancelation. An independent study shows that 95% of users experienced significant speech enhancement in noisy situations when using the product\u00a01).\nOne year in, the Consumer Hearing business is off to a good start, delighting consumers with a great sound and hearing experience, and pursuing the aim of reaching consumers wherever their hearing journey starts.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 Sonova Holding AG."
