        "raw_content": "Ukrainian Delegation at CES 2024: Techstars in Human Capital Management and Logistics\nThis year\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show will welcome a delegation of Ukrainian tech innovators. CES is a leading global technology conference, which serves as a pivotal platform for countries to showcase their technological innovation on an international stage. The event not only offers a space for networking and collaboration but also serves as a gateway for Ukrainian companies to forge partnerships, attract investments, and position themselves as key players in the global tech landscape.\nRead about medtech and startups in robotics which will represent Ukraine at CES 2024 in our previous article.\nContinuing the series of materials about Ukrainian startups that will represent our country at CES 2024, we are pleased to present you Ukrainian Techstars in Human Capital Management and Logistics: Meet the Shiny Club and Meredot.\nShiny Club\nShinyClub is a desktop gadget combined with an artificial intelligence service to improve the productivity of remote teams. Currently, Shiny Club has two founders, Igor and Viktor. Igor is in charge of software and promotion, and Viktor is in charge of the hardware part. They already had experience in manufacturing gadgets. Before that, they made a portable light for photographers, turned it into a business, and raised $100K in orders on Kickstarter.\n\u201cNowadays, AI devices appear like mushrooms. But we learned from our last project to do most of the production in Ukraine. It\u2019s a bit more expensive than in China, but we can control every stage of the process, so the quality is higher. In addition, the speed of production of the first batches is significantly accelerated. So we are betting on the speed of iteration and believe that at this stage we will be able to succeed due to this. We chose this niche because we work remotely a lot ourselves and need to manage our team. And as we see, remote work has become the norm even in hard-core startups. So this niche correlates well with the problems we have ourselves and with our experience in gadget production. I think we have found the so-called \u201cFounder market fit\u201d here,\u201d \u2014 commented Igor, CEO and co-founder at Shiny Club.\n\u201cThe American market is, of course, our main goal. It is difficult and interesting at the same time, because working there you work with the latest technologies and achievements. But both in the last project and in this one, we have most of our clients from the US, so I hope that we will be able to use this experience and understanding of this market,\u201d \u2014 Igor added.\nMeredot\nMeredot is a Ukrainian startup that creates wireless charging stations for micro mobility vehicles. Initially, they focused on electric scooters, but in 2022 they made a pivot and expanded their focus to electric shopping carts, scooters, wheelchairs, food delivery robots, and other similar equipment.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been an inventor since childhood, holding a soldering iron in my hands since the age of 10. Before starting my startup, I and my team developed innovative products for Schneider Electric in the smart home sector. Once, I envisioned the future in 30-50 years and asked myself: how will people charge their gadgets and transport? I wouldn\u2019t want to live in a future where we still use wires for charging electrical devices. The future is about innovation, where people engage in what they love without wasting time on trivialities. Therefore, I started small, developing technology for wireless energy transfer over distances. Of course, I wasn\u2019t the first, as there\u2019s a company in the U.S., Witricity, with $160 million in investments, but we managed to catch up and even surpass some of their solutions. We are now focused on the micro-mobility market and became the first company to launch a product in this segment. But this is just the beginning, we have a four-point strategy, and the last of them is dynamic wireless charging \u2013 electric cars will be able to charge while moving,\u201d \u2014 comments Roman Bysko, CEO at Meredot.\nAn excellent technology, a skilled team, and strong partners, such as Techstars, Alabama Power, USF, and the European Commission, stand behind them. As a startup, they have the ability to develop rapidly and avoid the time-consuming bureaucracy and protocol approval that large corporations face. While larger entities make decisions, they are already bringing their product to the market. Meredot doesn\u2019t fear change; Meredot creates it.\n\u201cThe American market welcomed us warmly. America is a nation of innovation, and it currently has the largest market for electromobility. We have already closed several deals and signed partnership agreements with major corporations, and we hope to start our expansion in the U.S. by 2024,\u201d \u2014 Roman added.\nWe wish Ukrainian innovators great success, new customers and strengthening of Ukraine\u2019s reputation as a tech country at the Consumer Electronic Show 2024!\nThe trade mission is organized by the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine together with the Ukrainian Startup Fund and UVCA \u2013 Ukrainian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association. The Ukrainian delegation will participate in the event with the support of the USAID Competitive Economy Program.

Deloitte Ukraine and CTS joint project.\nBringing us together in pursuit of a common goal\nNews\nUkrainian Venture Capital and Private Equity Market Outlook\nIn April 2019, the Ukrainian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (UVCA) held a presentation to announce the results of its annual research into the venture capital and private equity market, conducted jointly with Deloitte Ukraine\nThe Ukrainian investment market keeps growing. In 2018, venture investments in the IT sector totally reached $333.9 million, which is 1.5 up year-on-year. The number of agreements concluded considerably increased \u2013 from 89 in 2017 to 115 in 2018. Among them were seven M&A agreements for $25.2. For the most part, we observe particular interest the companies take in the so-called disruptive M&A, which bespeaks the interest of business in changes and implementation of innovations.\n\u201cThe volume of investments attracted to Ukraine by venture funds keeps growing in line with the private equity market, irrespective of some political uncertainty. This signifies that the IT and innovations sector is least exposed to political risks. The research results only substantiate the competitiveness of Ukrainian startups in the international market, the professionalism of Ukrainian specialists and the quality of Ukraine-produced goods. We are convinced that improvement of the geopolitical situation in the country will also boost investments in other sectors,\u201d noted Volodymyr Yumashev, Tax & Legal partner at Deloitte Ukraine, during the presentation.\nThe event included a panel discussion with the participation of Andrii Kolodiuk, co-founder and Managing Partner of the AVentures Capital venture fund, Oleksandr Sopronenkov, Director of Financial Advisory at Deloitte Ukraine, Olha Afanasiieva, Executive Director at Ukrainian Venture Capital and Private Equity Association (UVCA), and Iryna Cherniavska, Editor-in-Chief at Investory News, as moderator.\nDuring the panel discussion, Oleksandr Sopronenkov pointed out, \u201cIncreased number and cost of venture investments in 2018 is definitely a positive signal in terms of further development of the IT sector in Ukraine. From experience with our clients, we can see that foreign strategic and portfolio investors are taking greater interest in this sector\u201d.\nAndrii Kolodiuk voiced his opinion that the venture investment market is now undercapitalized. The majority of agreements barely exceed $100 thousand. Olha Afanasiieva is convinced that this relates to the fact that the better part of new startups are at their development stage. Importantly, it is not enough to develop a product, it is essential to be capable of selling it.\nIt is the improvement of marketing and communication capabilities of startup owners that can significantly strengthen the promotion of Ukrainian products and talent in the international arena. The Ukrainians should be ambassadors of their success stories so that foreign investors can form their opinion about the country not only on the basis of political publications in the media.\nOdessa, Dnipro and Lviv are among the regions of Ukraine where the number of startups is expected to increase. However, many more cities have good chances to get under the radar of investors if they enhance their marketing activities.\nAccording to Andriy Kolodiuk, in a 2-3 year perspective, Kyiv has every chance to get into the three cities of startups, and Ukraine may witness the emergence of five \u201cunicorns\u201d in 2-2,5 years. Artificial intelligence, blockchain, and big data analytics were flagged by the speakers as popular investment areas.\nVolodymyr Yumashev encouraged business and the Ukrainians to use this kind of reports by Deloitte, UVCA, and other reputable international companies to disseminate objective and relevant data among investors and other stakeholders.\u00a0\u201cDeloitte's mission is to make an impact that matters. Such initiatives help potential investors and other market players gain an insight into the real picture of developments in the sector. Ukraine does have a claim to fame! This is precisely what our next Ukrainian venture capital and private equity market\u00a0report is about,\u201d said Volodymyr.\nRecommendations\n\u00a9 2023.
