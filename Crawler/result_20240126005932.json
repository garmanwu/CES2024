        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Best of CES 2024: From 4K Projectors to Neural Headphones, Here Is the Best Tech to Look Forward to This Year\nThe Consumer Electronics Show features thousands upon thousands of tech products and we narrowed it down to the best.\nBy\nRudie Obias\nRudie Obias\neditor\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\nEvery year, the best and brightest companies in tech come to Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show \u2014\u00a0otherwise known as CES \u2014\u00a0to announce and showcase new entertainment, audio & video, wellness, household and transportation products for the year ahead.\nOver five days at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels and casinos, we visited booths, press conferences, presentations and participated in countless tech demos to find the best of the best of CES. These brands and products were chosen based on usefulness, function, innovation and overall cool factor.\nWe narrowed down the winners in a number of categories from laptops to robot vacuums and smart home devices to 4K TVs. We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar. The LG Soundbar S95TR is a 9.1.5-channel sound system that comes with 65-inch soundbar with three up-firing speakers, rear speakers and a subwoofer for your TV, while the system is Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and DTS:X compatible for immersive and detailed audio. It also connects wirelessly to just about any LG 4K TVs via WOWcast.\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nIf you\u2019re alone, but needed a portable solution to dynamic Zoom video calls or just making a TikTok video, the Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit is a very cool and useful way to make self-tracking videos with your Apple iPhone.It\u2019s MagSafe and NFC (Near Field Communication), so all you have to do is attach your iPhone and Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro will track and follow your body and face. During our time with the product, it appeared to move smoothly and effortlessly with 360-degree rotation and 90-degree tilt. wMeanwhile, it has up to five hours of use per charge and works in-app with TikTok, Zoom, Instagram and more.Belkin has it priced at $179.99, while the tech company has yet to announce availability.\nMaster & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic partnered with a neuroscience company called Neurable to deliver a pair of wireless headphones that can your track work sessions and measure your stress levels through your brain waves through a mobile app. They can even recommend when you should take a break when you\u2019re deep into your work.Aside from their focus capabilities, Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones offer premium audio quality with active noise cancellation and up to 32 hours of battery life per charge. The headphones are available for pre-order for $649 with delivery in early 2024.\nJBL Live 3 Earbuds\nNot only do the JBL Live 3 Earbuds feature world-class audio that crisp, clear and rich with active noise-cancellation, they offer something that most premium wireless earbuds do not \u2014\u00a0a charging case with a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen display. Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line. It has an AMOLED touchscreen display that comes in three case sizes (42mm, 47mm and 51mm), while the watch comes with an LED flashlight, a heart rate monitor, blood oxygen monitor, step and calorie counter and a built-in GPS with up to a whopping 16 days of battery life per charge.In our brief testing period, the Garmin Epix Pro appeared to be durable and solid since it\u2019s made with premium materials, such as stainless steel, a fiber-reinforced polymer, a steel rear cover and Corning Gorilla Glass. It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels. It has a 1000R curvature, 7680 x 2160 4K resolution with up to 120Hz for smooth motion and action when gaming, while it has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits. The monitor has dual 10-watt speakers for audio, as well as AMD\u2019s FreeSync Premium to reduce screen tearing or distortion. It\u2019s ideal for PC consoles, Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5.Acer will have it ready for retail sometime during the first half of 2024 with pricing starting at $2,499.99.\nRoboRock S8 MaxV Ultra\nThe new Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is a hybrid cleaner that vacuums up dirt, dust and grime from carpets, rugs, and hardwood floors with powerful 10,000Pa of suction pressure, while it also mops tiles in kitchens and bathrooms with dual sonic vibration scrubbers.The smart home robovac has a versatile charging dock that\u2019s self-emptying with up to a seven-week capacity of debris storage, self-filling water tank for mopping, and self-cleaning reservoir for maintenance on itself. The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is perfect for larger rooms and homes.Roborock has it priced starting at $1,800 with an expected release date sometime in spring 2024.\nXgimi Horizon Max Projector\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is an IMAX Enhanced-certified projector, which means it fits the criteria for the resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio from IMAX at home. This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. It has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode, so you can have different settings for different walls in your home. So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action. The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6. Devices, peripherals, and accessories\nOf the hundreds of new products revealed at CES 2024, Spiceworks gives a shoutout to the following for\nWhat was your favorite CES 2024 highlight?

Why Trust Us?\nThe 2024 edition of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) \u2014 one of the biggest annual consumer tech industry events \u2014 wraps today. Virtually countless new products debuted at the show over the past four days, and they ranged from computers and TVs to various home appliances and small gadget accessories. CES has always been a venue for brands to display concepts and ultra-premium offerings. (Take, this year, the stunning and transparent LG Signature OLED T TV.) But among the outstanding design and engineering, the most noteworthy trend this year was AI making its way into more and more of our tech.\nThe products at this year\u2019s trade show proved that in the years ahead, artificial intelligence will do a lot more than just help with productivity. AI will also enable a TV to deliver pristine picture quality, tune a speaker for optimal sound, and even make sure a meal is perfectly cooked, to name just a few tasks. AI-powered tech in everyday appliances looks bound to become a norm in the years ahead as well, if you\u2019re looking to give someone or yourself the gift of an extra pair of (virtual) hands around the house.\nAs we do every year, we spent days tuning in to product briefings and combing through press releases and spec sheets to handpick the best new gadgets that debuted at CES 2024. We focused on products that will actually go on sale and have the potential to make their way into consumers\u2019 daily routines in the weeks and months ahead. (There can be a lot of vaporware at the show, after all.)\nWe broke down the most exciting products that captured our attention into the following major categories: Entertainment & Audio, Computers & Accessories, Mobile Gadgets, Home & Appliances, and Family. Since most of these products are not available for purchase just yet, be sure to come back in the months ahead to learn more about these gadgets once we\u2019ve had hands-on experience with them.\nEntertainment & Audio\nThe TCL QM8 was our favorite TV of 2023, and its 2024 sequel is even more exciting. The latest iteration of the 4K TV brings a quantum dot mini LED panel with more local dimming zones for superior contrast and a peak brightness of a whopping 5,000 nits. That translates to double the brightness of the 2023 model, ensuring the 2024 TCL QM8 will deliver striking visuals even in brightly lit spaces.\nThe 4K TV will become available to order in the months ahead. We don\u2019t know the pricing details yet, but given TCL\u2019s track record, we expect it will be super reasonable. The tech giant also unveiled a TV with a stunning 115-inch mini LED screen \u2014 the largest of its kind.\n\u2014 Stefan Vazharov, Senior Technology Editor, Reviews\nIn addition to delivering a sleek design, comfy fit, and the iconic brand's signature sound and top-tier noise cancellation, the Momentum Sport true wireless earbuds by Sennheiser pack heart rate and temperature sensors for next-level activity and wellness tracking. The sensors' readings can integrate with the user's preferred health- and fitness-tracking platforms like Apple Health, Garmin Connect, Strava, and Peloton, to name a few.\nThe sweat- and water-resistant earbuds will become available to order in April for $329.99. There will be three colors to choose from: burned olive, polar black, and metallic graphite.\n\u2014 SV\nJBL\u2019s Live 670NC and Live 770NC wireless headphones are our favorite to arrive at CES 2024. Like their excellent predecessors, the newcomers deliver a mixture of elegant design, high-quality sound with spatial audio capabilities, reliable noise cancellation, and superb battery life, all at an agreeable price. The Live 670NC cans have an on-ear fit, while the 770NC has a traditional over-ear layout.\nThe latest JBL headphones will hit the shelves in March. The Live 770NC and Live 670NC will cost $199.95 and $129.95, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Samsung Music Frame, like the legendary TV with the same, is a tech product that can effortlessly blend into any home decor via customizable covers. Equipped with Samsung Q-Symphony tech, the speaker will sync perfectly with its maker\u2019s TVs and soundbars for an immersive surround sound experience.\nDetails about the pricing and retail availability of the Samsung Music Frame have yet to be made available, but we don't expect the wait to be too long.\n\u2014 SV\nThe JBL Xtreme 4 is a sequel to one of our favorite waterproof Bluetooth speakers and an instant best-in-class contender. The gadget is capable of blasting AI-enhanced sound that\u2019s customizable via an app and up to 30 hours of audio playback between power-ups. Its replaceable battery pack sets it apart from all rivals.\nWe like that JBL manufactured the speaker using 70% recycled plastic and 100% reclaimed fabric. The Xtreme 4 will hit the shelves this June in several colors with a $379.95 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nThe EarFun Wave Pro wireless headphones are the audio maker's first and a rock-solid contender for the best budget set in the game. Like the brand's stellar wireless earbuds, the over-ear cans offer an appealing combination of sleek design, customizable sound with support for Hi-Res Audio, and strong noise cancellation. To top things off, the headphones can rather impressively deliver 80 hours of wireless playback between charges.\nSales of the EarFun Wave Pro headphones will begin this spring. The headphones will cost $79.99 \u2014 an incredible design given their design, specs, and onboard features.\n\u2014 SV\nComputers & Accessories\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo is an exciting new addition to the PC laptop realm not only for its striking dual-screen design but also for its affordable price. The notebook will start below $1,500 when it becomes available to order this spring. Combined with its versatile design and high-end specs, the price makes a serious case for choosing the new ZenBook Duo over a premium touchscreen laptop with a conventional form factor.\nHardware-wise, the ZenBook Duo features a pair of high-resolution OLED touchscreens with a high refresh rate and a cutting-edge Intel Core chip with Arc graphics. Of course, the product will be bundled with a Bluetooth keyboard with an integrated trackpad.\n\u2014 SV\nHP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 gaming laptop impressed us by delivering top-tier hardware specs \u2014 an Intel Core Ultra chip, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics, a high-performance OLED display panel, and a rich set of connectivity features \u2014 in a compact and elegant package that weighs just a feather above 3.5 pounds. That\u2019s on par with the weight of a 14-inch MacBook Pro, making the Omen Transcend 14 incredibly lightweight and portable for a high-performance PC gaming rig.\nThe versatile Omen Transcend 14 is already available to pre-order from HP with a $1,500 starting price. That\u2019s quite a bargain, especially considering its striking design and futureproof specs.\n\u2014 SV\nThe detachable keyboard on Lenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid made it our favorite Android tablet of CES 2024. Because it features a full-blown PC with an Intel chip and Windows 11 on board, it gives you two devices (a laptop and a tablet) wrapped into one \u2014 not just a feature-rich tablet with a bundled keyboard.\nRemarkably, the two components can work together or separately, depending on your needs. The product will hit the shelves in the spring with a hefty $1,999 price tag.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 4K gaming monitor by Samsung deserves your attention for being great at, well, everything \u2014 from high-performance gameplay to delivering your favorite streaming content with incredible picture quality via the tech giant\u2019s smart platform. Combined with a minimalist design, the product\u2019s 32-inch display panel with millions of individually backlit pixels and antireflective finish makes it a great upgrade option for work and play.\nSamsung also equipped the monitor with a SmartThings Hub for controlling connected home gadgets. An ultra-wide Odyssey OLED G9 monitor with a curved 49-inch screen debuted as well for those who need to replace two screens.\n\u2014 SV\nNVIDIA launched the GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs during CES. The latest-generation graphics cards pack dedicated cores for AI processing, ensuring the cutting-edge tech will take the users\u2019 experience \u2014 from heavy workloads to in-game visuals \u2014 to a whole new level. The latest components deliver a significant performance bump over their top-shelf GeForce RTX 30 series predecessors.\nPricing of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs will start at a reasonable $599 for an RTX 4070 Super version. The range-topping RTX 4080 SUPER, dubbed a \u201c4K monster\u201d by its maker, will cost $999.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Razer Aetner monitor light bar is a handy desktop accessory that will give your work and gaming sessions a bright, colorful upgrade. The attachable dual light consists of an adjustable white strip and a back-facing row of color LEDs that are customizable via the excellent Razer Chroma RGB suite. The white light will illuminate your workspace, while the colorful backlight is a must for gaming.\nWe like that the Razer Aetner is compatible with the Matter smart home standard and that its LED lights have a lifetime of 25,000 hours.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Clutch Tanto Mini Xbox controller by HyperX \u2014 the maker of our favorite budget gamepad \u2014 stands out with an incredibly compact design. Its compact footprint is tailor-made for younger gamers. I tip my hat to HyperX for creating the product, as I still remember how unwieldy the three-button Sega Genesis controller was back in the early 1990s.\nThe tiny gamepad has a standard Xbox layout and a built-in audio jack. It will launch this spring with an attractive $39.99 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nDo you have a teenage gamer that's very amenable to bribery? RCA\u2019s new gaming monitor might just do the trick to get them to agree to study. My son, the gamer of our house, watched the press release and was blown away by the \u201cdamn fast\u201d 240Hz refresh rate, the 2-millisecond input lag, 1 millisecond GtG response time, cool swiveling features, USB-C 90W charging and DisplayPort Alt-Mode, and \u201csick backlighting.\u201d\nThe whole thing is on a pivot stand and seamlessly switches between PS5, computer, Xbox, or any other platform you choose to use it for. Personally, I\u2019m hoping some English homework makes it on the monitor between bouts of GTA. RCA is new to gaming monitors, but being the grandad of the electronics industry gives them a great leg-up, and we\u2019re excited to see more innovations like this from the brand in the future.\n\u2014 Cat Bowen, Senior Editor, Reviews\nMobile Gadgets\nOtterBox launched a lineup of elegant and sustainable iPhone cases made from sustainable cactus-based leather. Dubbed Desserto, the leather-like material is stylish, great to interact with, and, crucially, eco-friendly. The accessory giant also unveiled a MagSafe wallet and an Apple Watch band from the same material.\nThe MagSafe-compatible case will become available in several colors this spring for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro family. It will cost $59.99, while the MagSafe wallet and the Apple Watch band will go for $49.99 and $39.99, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nZagg launched a version of the iconic mophie juice pack battery case for the latest iPhones during CES 2024. A synonym for iPhone backup power for well over a decade, the nifty gadget will significantly extend the charging independence of the Apple smartphone while keeping it pocket-friendly. It will be available for iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nYou'll be able to pre-order the mophie juice pack in late February for $99.99, which will come with a robust two-year warranty.\n\u2014 SV\nBelkin's Stand Pro is not just yet another sleek MagSafe iPhone stand from the well-known accessory maker. Thanks to support for Apple's DockKit standard, the motorized accessory offers 360-degree movement tracking. This means that whether users are on a video call or capturing content for social media, they will always be perfectly framed.\nThe accessory has a button for enabling and disabling tracking. Of course, it also doubles as a fast MagSafe charger. You will be able to snag one in the months ahead for $179.99.\n\u2014 SV\nHome & Appliances\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight is a noteworthy, low-key addition to the maker\u2019s excellent lineup of lighting fixtures that were showcased at CES 2024. In a manner befitting its name, the smart home product consists of light panels that are flush-mountable on a ceiling. It\u2019s easily expandable and adaptable to any space and usage scenario.\nLike all Nanoleaf products, the Skylight can glow with millions of customizable colors and shades of white. It\u2019s controllable via an app or through voice commands from your preferred virtual assistant.\n\u2014 SV\nLG\u2019s latest Styler is a home appliance that will make the chore of storing and maintaining your favorite clothes in perfect condition a breeze. Thanks to a high-tech Moving Hanger system and an available Fine Dust cycle, the Styler will remove dust particles. What\u2019s more, the product\u2019s integrated high-pressure steamer can remove wrinkles and sanitize clothes.\nOther key Styler features include a room dehumidification functionality and a ventilation system. Pricing and availability details are yet to be revealed.\n\u2014 SV\nThe eufy X10 Pro Omni robot vacuum impressed us by offering a ton of desirable features at a price point that\u2019s well below $1,000. The versatile cleaning robot can vacuum and mop floors with the help of its sophisticated navigation setup feature. Better yet, it can empty its bin, refill its water container, and even clean and dry its mopping pads by docking into its Omni station.\nAnker will begin offering the eufy X10Pro Omni in February for $799.99. That\u2019s considerably less than big-name rivals with comparable features.\n\u2014 SV\nThis Wi-Fi-equipped smart deadbolt by Philips will replace your keys or smartphone with your palm. The convenient gadget has a sophisticated palm reader, which will unlock it by scanning your hand\u2019s vein patterns. The latter are unique for everyone, guaranteeing that only authorized users can unlock it.\nUnsurprisingly, the Philips deadbolt is also compatible with virtual assistant voice commands, allowing you to control it or keep tabs on its status. The product will be available to buy in the coming months for $359.99.\n\u2014 SV\nFamily\nWith the BeamO multiscope, Withings treated us to the best health and wellness gadget of CES 2024. The device sets a new standard for wellness monitoring by merging a contactless thermometer, a digital stethoscope, an ECG, and an oximeter in a sleek package that\u2019s easy to use at home or anywhere else.\nGetting the readings will take about a minute, and users will be able to share the results with their doctor via a sleek companion app. The BeamO will become available to order this summer for $249.95.\n\u2014 SV\nMasimo\u2019s monitoring technology is used in over 10 million babies annually in hosptials worldwide, and now they\u2019re bringing their powerful tech to parents with an FDA-approved-for-prescription wearable baby monitor. Utilizing a sock/boot style device, it monitors your baby\u2019s pulse, skin temperature if your baby has rolled over, alerting parents if anything is outside normal limits. It can be used when your baby is asleep and awake for continuous monitoring if your baby requires that.The Stork Baby Wearable Monitor can also share your baby\u2019s data with their health providers. For parents of medically fragile children, this little device could help bring a lot of peace, and because it\u2019s by-prescription, insurance may cover it, though insurance plans are not yet in place.\nThe non-prescription version is sold at major retailers, and it also includes a high-resolution video camera along with all of the monitoring available in the prescription monitor, without the immediate alerts.\u2014 CB\nMaxi Cosi is one of our favorite baby brands at Best Products. They\u2019re known for their high-quality, innovative, affordable baby products, and as of CES 2024, they've entered into the electronics space. With the See Pro 360\u00ba Baby Monitor, they\u2019re taking their affordable and innovative reputation and applying it to a very pricey realm.The See Pro 360\u00ba is a combination of a handheld monitor and camera and a smartphone monitor, giving parents choices of how to view their baby. Like last year\u2019s debut, the Q-Bear, this monitor uses CryAssist technology not only to detect when your baby\u2019s crying but also to translate the sounds to determine if your baby is sleepy, hungry, wet, or just plain cranky.\nIt has everything you\u2019d expect in a modern monitor: two-way talking, temperature and humidity sensors, a high-definition camera with clear color, night vision, and a long battery life on the monitor itself. It\u2019s doing this all for just $199.\u2014 CB\nThe Owlet is not new to the wearable baby monitor game, but they\u2019ve recently stepped up their game, and they\u2019re showing it off at CES. Like Masimo, they\u2019re offering an FDA-cleared-for-prescription wearable baby monitor for parents of babies with a need for clinical monitoring outside of the clinical setting. The Owlet offers something unique from Masimo in that your child\u2019s pediatrician can set the parameters for the alerts sent to them and the parents.\nThe BabySat measures oxygen levels, heart rate, and levels of motion. Stats are easily viewable through Owlet\u2019s straightforward app. Like their original sock, it\u2019s a wireless monitoring device designed to stay put on your baby\u2019s foot all night (and day) long.\u2014 CB\nTikiSmart just finished a wildly successful crowd-funding campaign, and now they\u2019re showcasing their kid-safety system at CES. TikiSmart is a first-of-its-kind whole-home child monitoring device. It\u2019s a wearable device that tracks when your child gets near something dangerous, like if they\u2019re submerged in water or if they fall suddenly.The system includes a receiver, bracelets, and monitoring tags. You use the tags to determine danger areas, and if your child approaches it while wearing the monitoring bracelet, it alerts your phone and speaks the alert aloud over the receiver.\nYou can also buy a \u201crepeater\u201d that extends the coverage much in the same way a wifi extender extends your wifi coverage. The TikiSmart is bound to get a lot of buzz, likely both negative and positive, but for parents with family pools, a pond, or even a fire pit, the allure will likely be hard to resist.\u2014 CB\nThe Toniebox is one of the best storytelling devices, in our opinion, and they\u2019re coming out with some fantastic new characters that they\u2019re debuting at CES.Sara Llama is the Yoga Tonie, and she\u2019ll guide your child through four stories, each with a theme central to yoga, like friendship and confidence. There\u2019s Juniper, the potty training Tonie that uses stories to help your child prepare for potty training. And finally, there\u2019s Mo, the mindfulness Tonie that walks your child through mindful activities through his stories.\u2014 CB\nStefan is the senior technology editor for Best Products, where he\u2019s been covering the tech industry and testing the latest gadgets since 2015. He is an award-winning editor with more than a decade of experience reporting on and reviewing consumer tech products, especially smartphones, tablets, laptops, and audio gear like headphones, earbuds, speakers, and soundbars. Stefan was previously the U.S. editor for GSMArena.com. His work can also be found on Popular Mechanics and other Hearst publications.\nCat Bowen has been covering parenting and home for over a decade. At Best Products, she has tested hundreds of products for parents and for the home, often spending dozens of hours per product to ensure her reviews are accurate and informative. Prior to joining the team, she was at Romper where she covered everything from breastfeeding to child sleep habits to abortion rights access. You can find her work on Bustle, Romper, and more. Cat is a bit of an intellectual magpie and perpetual student, most recently receiving a graduate degree in gender studies where she examined a topic that vexes so many \u2014 pockets in women\u2019s clothing.\nBluetooth Tech\nThe 100 Coolest Tech Gadgets of 2024\nThe 7 Best Bluetooth Headphone Adapters of 2024\nTested: 1More PistonBuds Pro Q30 Wireless Earbuds\nThe 7 Best Trackpads for More Intuitive Control\n6 Best Smartwatches for Kids at Every Price Point\nHow to Protect Yourself From Bluetooth Hacking\nThese Waterproof Speakers Don\u2019t Slack on Sound\nApple AirPods 3 Are Down To $139 at Amazon\nGoogle\u2019s Pixel Buds Pro Are 30% Off At Amazon\nAmazon Echo Buds Are Up To 39% Off\n7 Best Sleep Headphones for a Better Night\u2019s Rest\n8 Best GPS Pet Trackers to Keep Tabs on Your Pet\nA Part of Hearst Digital Media\nWe may earn a commission for purchases made through our links.\n\u00a92024 Hearst Magazine Media, Inc.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

        "raw_content": "Inside-Out Phones, Folding TVs: Behold The Eye-Popping Tech of CES 2024\nThe world's largest consumer tech show is a showcase of incredible innovation, and this is the cream of the crop.\nWe got an eyeful of a 137-inch TV that folds and unfolds, here at CES 2024.\nCES 2024\u00a0is full of innovative delights,\u00a0futuristic concepts, practical products you can\u00a0preorder or buy today\u00a0and some of the\u00a0strangest tech to stumble across our paths. Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives.\nAs we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of\u00a0ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies,\u00a0new car tech, gaming gear and robots\u00a0-- there's even a robot for your dog.\nHere's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.\nRead more: \u00a0The Best of Show at CES 2024.\nAR/VR glasses that fit in one room\nApple may have stolen the show in absentia announcing that the Vision Pro would be available next month, but the headset is still insanely expensive at $3,500. While it's yet to be seen whether\u00a0AR/VR technology will take off, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, including the intriguing-looking Xreal Air 2 Ultra ($699). The Xreal is a lot more compact than the Apple behemoth, the price is relatively competitive and CNET's Lisa Eadiciccio was impressed by its image quality. However, she says the headset still needs to be tethered to another device, and it'll need third-party developers if it's to have a chance against Apple or even Google.\nA portable, add-on OLED display that folds\nSecondary displays are a productivity godsend, enabling the kind of multitasking that isn't possible even with the widest monitors. While portable solutions are available, the best solutions tend to be tethered to your desk. Maker Asus says the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH is the first portable OLED display -- and as the name suggests, it also folds! With the superior image quality of OLED, this 17.3-incher should be great for on-the-go movies or gaming, when it hits later in 2024.\nHitch a ride on a flying EV taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the debut of the Supernal S-A2.\nBanish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design\u00a0and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter. As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.\nThe future is electric\nHonda promises that the Saloon will match \"the joy of driving\" with steer-by-wire technology.\nAs we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle that could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the \"board room on wheels\" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs!\nThe most impressive, and most-likely concept to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing \"steer-by-wire\" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new \"floating H\" logo.\nFoldable phones? How about a foldable TV?\nThe C Seed N1, unfolded.\nWhat to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch C Seed N1 showed off at CES 2024.\nThe custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture,\nand its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk\nin about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV.\nOh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nSteam Deck has a new challenger\nMSI's new game handheld runs Windows but has Intel inside.\nAfter years of near misses such as the Steam Machine, the Steam Deck was an unexpected success for Valve, and the console is the current standard for mobile PC gaming. While the competing\u00a0Asus ROG Ally looked cool, using Windows on it was apparently pretty clunky. Now that situation might change with the help of Intel -- the company has a lot of experience making Windows machines. MSI's Claw handheld obviously owes a debt to the Steam Deck, but it has Intel's new Meteor Lake chips onboard instead of AMD chips. CNET's Scott Stein says this development means more manufacturers will have the opportunity to design their own Steam Deck-alikes that can also run Windows.\nWhat's old is new\nIf\nyou consider yourself an old-school smartphone user, you may yearn for\nthe physical keyboards that used to be a mainstay of the phones of\nyesteryear. The iPhone's on-screen keyboard ushered out the full\nphysical keyboards that were popular on\u00a0BlackBerry\u00a0devices.\nThe Clicks keyboard,\nfrom Clicks Technology, will transform your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15\nPro and Pro Max, adding a keyboard that's actually integrated into a\nwraparound case. This $139 wraparound slides onto your device and runs\noff the phone's battery, so no charging required. Be sure to check out our hands-on review.\nThis phone bends over backward for you\nAs phones with screens that fold in half get more consumer attention, Samsung appears to be poised to flip the market again. The electronics giant showcased a concept handset at\u00a0CES 2024 called the Flex In & Out Flip that can fold in both directions and completely backward, allowing you to use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nWhen bent backward, one side is slightly shorter than the other, to avoid covering the camera, while the larger side was big enough to show several icons in the phone's quick settings menu, media playback controls and the time and battery level. Although the handset is only a concept design right now, CNET's Lisa Eadicicco points out that it might offer a hint at the future of devices that roll, flex, bend, fold and otherwise contort to adapt tech to our unique needs.\nGet to work with this gaming laptop\nMore and more, we're asking our laptops to do double duty. In addition to strong gaming performance, we want to be able to use these thinner, lightweight devices for work or school. The HP Omen Transcend 14, which made its debut at CES 2024, is light enough for a daily commute but sports a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display with a 48-120Hz variable refresh rate backed up by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070.\nThe 14-inch laptop weighs only 3.6 pounds (1.6 kilograms) -- light for a gaming laptop and has battery life good for up to 11.5 hours with the integrated graphics and an Eco mode. The new 14-inch size starts at $1,500. A 16-inch version will also be available with the option for a 4K 240Hz OLED starting at $1,900.\nThis thermometer also checks your heart and lungs\nIf you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer,\nelectrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was\nunveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you \"beam it,\" the device can give you clues about your health.\nThe device, which Withings describes as being \"portable and smaller than a smartphone,\"\ncombines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of\nthe wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like\nblood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used\nas a \"digital stethoscope.\"\nFollowing expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nForget a projector, get a huge TCL instead\nThe TCL 115QM891G is a 115-inch TV that's 8.5 feet wide and around 6 feet tall on its stand.\nCNET's projector reviewer Geoff Morrison has been extolling the benefits of projectors for many years, but even he has come around to technologies like OLED and Mini-LED of late. What would he think of the new TCL 115QM891G? This is a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's up to five times brighter than most TVs, and with better blacks too, according to TV reviewer David Katzmaier.\nAs TV reviewers ourselves we've seen large TVs, but in the old days they were stuck at HD. The pixels on Panasonic's\u00a0103-inch 1080p, for instance, were huge and easily noticeable. This is why 4K technology is so great -- it means you can install a TV as big as a wall, and not see black lines between the pixels. The TCL is also going to be a lot cheaper than that $100,000 Panasonic too, at under $20,000.\nStained glass gets a new lease on lifelong power\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nSolar panels are great -- they produce electricity from one of the most abundant resources we have, and they pay for themselves in quick order -- but no one has ever called them pretty. Fear not! Japanese company inQs has worked out a way to make solar cells out of colored glass. The company is exhibiting a number of objects at CES 2024, including a\u00a0stained glass pane that generates electricity. The devices are small, and one was able to power only a desk fan, but we like how they point to a rethink of how solar panels should look and work.\nDisguising weird-looking things has been a perpetual trend at CES, as with LG's ArtCool air conditioners. And this year the Samsung Music Frame lets you put art inside a smart speaker.\nHey, Ida, which is better: Alexa or Siri?\nAI is already everywhere here at CES 2024 -- and adding to the list of products it'll be appearing in is cars. Volkswagen has announced a deal with ChatGPT that\u00a0enables users to ask all sorts of questions of their car, in the same way they would of a traditional digital assistant. At the moment, VW's voice assistant lets users say, \"Hey, Ida,\" to ask a question about something basic, like requesting tire pressure. But the automaker's cars are incapable of answering more advanced questions like, \"When did the New York Jets last win the Super Bowl?\" Under the new deal, if the car's assistant can't answer the question, it'll hand off the query to ChatGPT. (Yes, the Jets did win one. But it was a very, very long time ago.)\nIt's worth noting that competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri have been completing these queries natively for many years, so teaming with ChatGPT is an easier way for VW's Ida to catch up.\nMust-see-through TV\nThis transparent display, currently showing fish, can transform into a 77-inch TV.\nTVs are getting bigger every year, which means there's a bigger slab of black plastic taking up a significant portion of the living room wall when it's not in use. But what if we could make it disappear, without actually pulling it off the wall?\nLG has apparently done just that with a\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0that converts from a \"fish tank\" to a 77-inch television (pictured above). Unlike Samsung's competing technology this will apparently be a real product, shipping later in 2024.\nMeanwhile Samsung is showing off the first transparent version of its\u00a0Micro-LED display tech\u00a0at\u00a0CES 2024. While transparent OLED and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, Samsung says its Micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the current tech. But Samsung says its transparent Micro-LED tech isn't available in the market, so what Katzmaier saw (or didn't see?) is essentially a concept.\nA 2-minute ice cream maker\nWe scream for ice cream.\nComing soon to a restaurant near you: freshly made ice cream, ready from start to finish in just 2 minutes.\nWe've loved trying the vanilla ice cream churned out by the speedy ColdSnap -- first in 2021 and then again this year. We're still a year away from being able to buy one of these innovative ice cream makers for our homes, but the company came to CES this year with the news that its restaurant partners will have hold of the machines much sooner.\nThe countertop ice cream maker uses Keurig-like pods to make a bowl of the cold stuff in less than 2 minutes. The finished result has a gelato-like consistency that had us coming back for more every time we passed the ColdSnap booth.\nRobot stain fighter\nSamsung is set to unveil its Bespoke Jet Bot Combo this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nHere's a product sure to clean up -- literally. Samsung's new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, a smart robot vacuum with a mop, does more than just get rid of dust bunnies and dog hair. It's designed to roam your rooms scouting for stains on hard flooring and scrub them out so you don't have to.\nThe robot taps AI-powered object recognition to identify stains on hard flooring. Yes, it can tell the difference between the surfaces, presumably making adjustments to its cleaning technique accordingly. You can also tell this likely $1,000-plus household helper where it can and can't go as it attacks stains as bad as a puppy piddle or a zinfandel spill with a spinning mop that hits 170 rpm. (Pricing details aren't yet available.)\nTeeth tech\nAI isn't just helping keep your floors clean, it's also being used to make sure your teeth are as clean as they can be. The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush features an algorithm-controlled motor, five brush modes tailored to specific needs, an interactive touchscreen that shows you areas you missed and, brilliantly/weirdly, an AI voice guide that speaks into your brain via bone conduction to help you improve your technique.\nIt also features Wi-Fi connectivity so you can pair it with your home network, and it will store information about your brushing history until you can download it to your app. It also offers 40 days of battery life through wireless charging. It will go on sale in the US in the fall for $130.\nIt's all in the wristwatch remote\nWhat if your smartwatch could also control your lamps, your Netflix programs and more?\nImagine using your wrist to control everything around you. A flick this way, and you can turn off the lights or scroll through the offerings on Netflix. Finnish startup Doublepoint has developed software that can turn an Android watch into a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection.\nThe software will come to developers in the first half of this year,\nbut it's up to developers and app-makers to decide what a small gesture, such as tapping fingers or rotating your wrist, will actually do.\nSteven Musil, Sareena Dayaram, Katie Collins and Ty Pendlebury contributed to this article.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

While the car itself may not be any closer to moving out from being a concept, Sony had some fun with it: they drove it onto the stage with a PlayStation controller.\nPresident of Sony Honda Mobility Izumi Kawanishi was quick to point out that Afeela owners likely won\u2019t be driving cars using controllers in the future.\n\u2014\u2014\nHYUNDAI SEES A FUTURE IN HYDROGEN\nJose Munoz, president and global CEO of Hyundai Motor Company, speaks during a Hyundai news conference before the start of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung have unveiled transparent TVs at the show, with LG having just announced its OLED-powered display will go on sale later this year.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u2019s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode.\n\u201cThe unique thing about OLED is it\u2019s an organic material that we can print on any type of surface,\u201d explains David Park from LG\u2019s Home Entertainment Division.\n\u201cAnd so what we\u2019ve done is printed it on a transparent piece of glass, and then to get the OLED picture quality, that\u2019s where we have that contrast film that goes up and down.\u201d\nContent is delivered wirelessly to the display using LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box which sends 4K images and sound.\nWhy would you need a transparent TV?\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, the OLED T can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\nSamsung\u2019s transparent MICRO LED-powered display showed off the technology as a concept.\n___\nADS COMING TO SHOPPING CARTS\nFood companies advertise all over the grocery store with eye-catching packaging and displays. Now, Instacart hopes they\u2019ll start advertising right on your cart.\nThis week at CES, the San Francisco-based grocery delivery and technology company is unveiling a smart cart that shows video ads on a screen near the handle. General Mills, Del Monte Foods, and Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream are among the companies who will advertise on the carts during an upcoming pilot at West Coast stores owned by Good Food Holdings.\nInstacart says a screen might advertise deals or show a limited-edition treat, like Chocolate Strawberry Cheerios. It might also share real-time recommendations based on what customers put in the cart, like advertising ice cream if a customer buys cones.\nInstacart got into the cart business in 2021 when it bought Caper, which makes smart carts with cameras and sensors that automatically keep track of items placed in them. Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

        "raw_content": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

        "raw_content": "Biggest Trends of CES 2024: AI, Transparent Screens and Off-Grid Tech to Power Your Home\nThe trends emerging from the Las Vegas tech show are setting the tone for the year to come.\nAI is one of the most persistent themes at CES 2024.\nThere's an element of predictability when it comes to what we'll see every year at the Las Vegas tech bonanza CES. Big TVs? Tick. Home robots that never go on sale? Tick. An unnecessarily overdesigned toothbrush? Tick.\nEvery CES also brings its standout trends that dominate the big, flashy press conferences, the show floor and the late-night chatter at casino bars. Some of the biggest trends at this week's CES 2024 were easy to foresee; a massive emphasis on AI, for example. Others, such as transparent screens and new solutions to take your house off the grid, were only discernible once we'd scoured the show floors of the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nHere are our key takeaways, distilled for you based on everything CNET's editors have seen, tested and played with.\nAI in everything\nYou have about as much chance of winning at the slot machines as finding a company that doesn't boast of its AI prowess at CES 2024. This is far from the first time AI-powered products could be found amid the booths, but this is truly the year that AI is dominating the show.\nRead more: The Most Captivating Tech at CES 2024\nThe way it's showing up, says Forrester principal analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee, is \"a layer of intelligence that sits atop a traditional product or service to enhance the customer experience.\" He points to products such as bird feeders to identify birds and pillows that adjust to reduce snoring as key examples.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nWhat we're witnessing right now is the integration of major breakthroughs in AI that have occurred in the past year or so -- such as OpenAI's ChatGPT -- into devices. \"There's no question that AI -- specifically generative AI -- is going to be a big driver of new products and services,\" says CNET's AI guru Connie Guglielmo.\nGuglielmo highlights Microsoft's decision to change up the Windows keyboard for the first time in nearly 30 years, adding a button that provides a direct link to launch its AI Copilot, as a key example. Another is\u00a0Volkswagen adding ChatGPT as a standard feature in its vehicles later this year. \"You can literally talk your car in a Knight Rider kind of way,\" she says.\nAlong with the AI products we've experienced firsthand, companies are dropping hints left, right and center at CES about what we can expect to see from them in the year ahead. In an\u00a0interview with CNET Senior Editor Lisa Eadicicco, Google's Sameer Samat, general manager and vice president of Android, Google Play and Wear OS, said that AI will play a key role in the evolution of how we interact with our phones.\nThat supports Guglielmo's take that \"we're just starting to see how this foundational tech is going to change the way we work, live and engage with the world.\"\nWe're already curious to see how this rapidly evolving technology will have changed the game again by the time CES 2025 rolls around.\nThe VW Golf will get chatbot technology from Cerence and OpenAI.\nThe screen, reinvented\nScreen technology is always a big deal at CES and this year is no exception, with exciting display advancements seen in everything from massive TVs to concept bendable phones. As CNET's TV expert David Katzmaier puts it, \"TVs are even bigger and brighter this year. Hisense and TCL, both made their mini-LED lineups twice as bright for the same money as last year, and both introduced huge, expensive models with eye-watering specifications at 110 and 115 inches.\"\nNeither model has been priced yet, but they're expected to cost many thousands of dollars. New screen tech never comes cheap, and nowhere is that more obvious than in C Seed's wild, folding N1, which splits its 137-inch display into five sections to neatly fold away -- and which comes with an astonishing $200,000 price tag. What cost-of-living crisis?\nCrazy displays for days.\n\"A new trend this year is transparent displays\" Katzmaier says. \"LG has made transparent OLED screens for the last few years for businesses, but its newest model will go on sale later this year for consumers.\"\nThe idea behind that new model, the OLED T, is to allow a screen to blend more seamlessly into the surrounding room when it's not in use, rather than simply being a gigantic black rectangle. When not in use, the display looks more like a window, with fish, stars or other objects dancing across the glass and a black film rising to cover the rear when you want it to function as a regular TV. As Katzmaier puts it: \"It's one of the coolest TVs I've ever seen.\"\nNot one to let LG have all the fun, Samsung showed off its own transparent display technology using micro-LEDs which look brighter and more colorful than OLED screens. While the demo was cool, it's more likely we'll see Samsung's see-through screen in commercial applications in the near future, rather than for your next TV.\nSamsung showed off new screen tech for its phones, too. Its Flex In & Out Flip concept caught Eadicicco's eye. \"The concept is a Z Flip-style phone that can bend both ways,\" she says. \"With a device like this, you'd be able to use the screen whether the device is opened or closed, potentially making your phone much easier to use in one hand.\"\nTerrible product name aside, the Flex In & Out Flip shows that companies like Samsung --\nalong with Motorola and its awesome rollable phone concept shown last year -- aren't ready to settle on one folding phone design just yet.\nNext-gen gaming technology\nGaming tech remains a staple of the show floor at this year's CES. New Intel 14th-gen mobile chips were found inside new laptops from Alienware, Lenovo, Asus, Razer and others along with expected updates across the board for higher performance. Many products, including HP's new Omen, are eschewing the typical \"battlestar\" aesthetic of many legacy gaming machines, instead giving options for those of us wanting a \"one size fits all\" machine for working during the day and fragging noobs at night.\nWe've also seen new graphics cards from Nvidia, vibrating gaming seats from Razer and refreshed gaming-focused phones from Asus.\nMSI's The Claw is one of the most powerful handheld game consoles yet.\nBut we've also been treated to the first handheld PC gaming console using Intel chips. Valve's SteamDeck gave us our first experience of playing PC games in a hand-held format when it launched back in 2022, and both Asus and Lenovo were quick to bring out their own versions. But while the models from Valve, Asus and Lenovo all use AMD processors, MSI's new Claw handheld packs Intel Core Ultra 5 or 7 processors, which CNET Principal Writer Scott Stein reckons could make it the most powerful PC handheld around.\nWindows-based PC handhelds have been generally well received, allowing keen gamers to enjoy their polygon punching from the comfort of their couches without having to always fire up a gigantic, LED-strewn gaming rig. MSI's Intel-based model will bring a fresh injection of competition to the burgeoning category.\n\"What the Claw symbolizes may be even more important than what it does,\" Stein says. \"Intel is joining the party on new handheld-ready gaming chips, which suggests that hardware manufacturers should be even more able to create Steam Deck-like handhelds running Windows.\"\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nEnergy tech evolution\nAt previous editions of CES, the lack of home energy tech and serious solutions to help us tackle the environmental crisis has left us a little puzzled. There's no time like the present to right those wrongs and declare green technology a major trend of the show this year.\nOver the past few years, we've been buffeted by cost-of-living and environmental crises, amid skyrocketing energy prices, a greater need for more sophisticated heating and cooling tech, pressure on the electrical grid and waves of power outages. Smart homeowners everywhere are more aware that they need to take their energy management into their own hands, and CES 2024 has shown us how tech companies are responding.\nProducts such as a portable, whole-home backup battery from EcoFlow and new solar technology in the form of electricity-generating stained glass are just some of the innovations in energy technology. Meanwhile, our road to increasing self-reliance is being paved with things like\u00a0moisture-farming tech that can generate water from thin air and smart energy services that let you switch between on-grid and off-grid energy sources with a single button.\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nAre the products at CES 2024 enough to make a serious statement about the tech industry's commitment to sustainability? No. But as Forrester principal analyst Thomas Husson said ahead of the show, it's \"a small step in the right direction.\"\n\"The next stage would be to embed sustainability and circular economy principles into the very design of new technology and product offerings,\" he added.\nIn the meantime, the new technologies we've seen this year can help us imagine what a livable future looks like as the realities of climate change, particularly extreme weather, continue to set in.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

LG showed off their Signature OLED T, which is built with a stunning transparent OLED panel that changes to opaque at the push of a button. Hisense and TCL unveiled some of the largest TVs ever made, and Samsung talked about updates to their OLED flagship line, the S95D.\nCES 2024\nWith so few TVs discussed at the event, it was easy to find what truly stood out. I chose the LG Signature OLED T as my best overall TV from CES 2024 for its innovative transparent OLED panel, modular design, and excellent picture and sound quality. At the time of writing, only the TCL S5 is available for sale or pre-order, but I and other ZDNET experts will work to include retail links as they become available.\nLG OLED T\nBest overall\nLG Signature OLED T specs \u2013 Screen size: 77 inches | Panel type: Transparent OLED | Resolution: 4K | Refresh rate: Not specified | HDR: Not specified | Audio: Not specified | Voice controls:\nNot specified\nLG certainly caught everyone's attention at CES 2024 with the dramatic unveiling of their Signature OLED T model. It aims to revolutionize televisions with a transparent (yes, it's actually transparent) OLED panel that allows you to seamlessly meld the TV with your decor or the actual construction of your space.\nThe panel goes opaque with the touch of a button, so you can place the TV in front of a window in transparent mode to take in the scenery and then watch your favorite shows and movies in opaque mode at any time. The TV also utilizes an entirely wireless setup with the Zero Connect Box which beams video and audio signals directly to the OLED T regardless of where it's plugged in, giving you almost endless placement possibilities. And with a modular display design, you can completely customize a wall-mount shelving system or TV stand display tailored exactly to your space and entertainment needs.\nAnd while the Signature OLED T isn't up for pre-order just yet, you can read more on LG's official site and stay up-to-date on release information.\nTCL S5 98-inch\nBest mid-range\nTCL S5 specs - Screen size: 98 inches, more TBA | Panel type: LED | Resolution: 4K | Refresh rate: 120Hz | HDR: Dolby Vision IQ | Audio: DTS Virtual: X | Voice controls: Alexa, Hey Google\nTCL updated their mid-range S-Series with the S5, finally bringing the brand's AiPQ processing engine to the model. The S5 uses the AiPQ engine to analyze movies and shows scene-by-scene and run each image through an AI-assisted algorithm for enhanced contrast and detailing. It also supports Dolby Vision IQ HDR for better color and more lifelike images.\nWith a 120Hz refresh rate, you'll get buttery-smooth motion in fast-paced or action-filled scenes in sports broadcasts, movies, and shows. And DTS Virtual: X audio support gives you clean, clear sound. The S5 uses the Google TV platform to give you access to thousands of streaming apps like Netflix, Hulu, and Disney+ as well as built-in Hey Google voice commands; though you can connect the TV to your Alexa account if you prefer.\nAt the time of writing, the TCL S5 is only available in the extra-large 98-inch version, though more options are on the way in 2024.\nTCL QM8\nBest big-screen\nTCL QM8 specs - Screen size: 115-inches | Panel type: QD-Mini LED | Resolution: 4K | Refresh rate: 120Hz streaming/144Hz gaming mode | HDR: Dolby Vision | Audio: Not specified | Voice controls: Not specified\nTCL took the phrase \"go big, or go home\" literally, unveiling their largest-ever flagship model, the 115-inch QM8. I reviewed the 65-inch version in 2023 and was impressed with the price-to-feature ratio as well as the picture and audio quality. With the new screen size also comes an all-new QD-Mini LED panel for even better color, contrast, and detailing.\nThe dedicated gaming mode returns with support for AMD FreeSync VRR technology to prevent screen tearing and stuttering, but you'll also get 144Hz refresh rates for even smoother motion during fast-paced and action-packed gameplay and cutscenes.\nHisense 110UX\nBest for bright rooms\nHisense 110UX specs - Screen size: 110 inches\u00a0| Panel type: Mini LED | Resolution: 4K | Refresh rate: 120Hz | HDR: Dolby Vision | Audio: Dolby Atmos | Voice controls: Alexa, Hey Google\nThe Hisense 110UX is set to be the brightest TV you can get for your living room, offering up to an impressive 10,000 nits of brightness. This means that you'll have almost zero visibility issues in harsh overhead lighting or direct sunlight. It also boasts a 110-inch screen, one of the largest revealed at CES 2024, offering 4K resolution and a 120Hz refresh rate as well as Dolby Vision support for superior picture quality.\nYou'll also get great audio with Dolby Atmos support, which creates virtual surround sound for a more immersive experience while streaming music, movies, and TV shows. And with built-in support for both Alexa and Hey Google virtual assistants, you'll get hands-free controls over the TV for launching apps, searching for something new to watch, and even things like checking the weather or setting a timer.\nWhat is the best TV of CES 2024?\nMy choice for the best TV unveiled at CES 2024 is far and away the LG Signature OLED T. It features a truly innovative transparent OLED panel that can go opaque at the touch of a button. It also utilizes an entirely wireless connectivity scheme, bundling with the Zero Connect box which beams video and audio signals directly to the TV no matter where it's plugged in. This means you can put the TV just about anywhere and have it blend seamlessly with your d\u00e9cor or be incorporated into the design of your home as a room divider or window.\nIt also features a modular display design which can be tailored to your exact needs for your space whether you decide to wall-mount or use a more traditional stand display.\nBest TV of CES 2024\nPre-order?\nScreen size\nPanel type\nLG Signature OLED T\nNo\n77 inches\nTransparent OLED\nTCL S5\nAvailable now\n98 inches\nLED\nTCL QM8 QD-Mini LED\nNo\n115 inches\nQLED (available now), QD-Mini LED TBA\nHisense 110UX\nNo\n110 inches\nMini LED\nWhat special features do TVs at CES 2024 have?\nOne of the most popular themes of CES 2024 is \"bigger is better.\" Both Hisense and TCL unveiled 110- and 115-inch models (respectively) for true big-screen entertainment. LG also wowed the crowd with their Signature OLED T, which features a transparent-to-opaque panel and modular display design. And just about every new TV that was introduced will use some sort of AI-assisted processor chip for better upscaling of non-4K content and more consistent picture and audio quality.\nCheck out this CES 2024 TV...\nIf you want...\nLG Signature OLED T\nAn innovative, transparent-to-opaque OLED TV for seamless integration with your decor or home construction.

It used to be held twice a year, once in Las Vegas and once in Chicago. But in 1998, CES found a permanent home in Las Vegas for a once-yearly technology and electronics expo.\nRelated\n5 exciting Android features Google just announced at CES 2024\nProtect your dog's AirTag with a new collar designed to hold a waterproof case\nAlexa just got three new generative AI skills - here's how to try them"

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Another key question will be around attendee numbers, which recovered post-pandemic to 115,000 visitors in 2023, according to show organiser, the Consumer Technology Association (CTA).\nCES 2024: What to expect\nHere we\u2019ll take a look through a selection of the biggest media and tech launches at the show, some of the key trends, and what impact these are likely to have throughout the coming year.\nCES has always been a key moment in the AV calendar, when the biggest manufacturers in panels come together, promote their various enhancement technologies and announce the newest ranges. With Samsung, LG, Sony, all vying for the same space, there will be some serious innovation on show. The big news will be in the 100-inch TV segment (a fact that was also true way back in 2019), but there will be plenty of OLED and Mini-LED activity too, as well as a slew of transparent displays from both LG and Samsung in particular, which look to be moving from the prototype stage of former years towards a more production-ready design.\nLG\u2019s new OLED lineup makes much of an updated Alpha 11 AI processor that offers four times the performance of last year\u2019s models, upscaling objects and backgrounds to reduce blur and claims to analyse and adjust colours to \u201cbest convey the mood and emotional elements intended by filmmakers.\u201d While the resolution remains at 4K, refresh rates have increased to 144Hz.\nRead more\u00a0The Best Stories of IBC2023\nSamsung, meanwhile, is sticking to the \u2018bigger is better\u2019 UHD playbook, with two new 8K TV lines at CES, along with an 8K home theatre projector. The Neo QLED QN900D relies on Samsung\u2019s 8K AI Upscaling Pro image processing engine to convert 4K content into 8K, and also upscale lower-res content to 4K. The flagship QN900D supports variable refresh rate (VRR) at up to 240Hz, while the QN800D offers a 120Hz refresh rate and no AI upscaling.\nSeparately, Samsung Display has also teased that the 2024 QD-OLED TV panel will be capable of \u201cutilising advanced panel drive technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve a maximum brightness of over 3000 nits. This makes it the brightest OLED TV panel available\u2026\u201d The new S95D QD-OLED TV also features an unusually competent glare-free display that minimises reflections.\nThe projector market continues to diversify too, with Xgimi\u2019s Horizon Max - claimed to be the world\u2019s first IMAX Enhanced long throw projector, debuting at CES2024. The projector follows last year\u2019s Xgimi Horizon Ultra, the world\u2019s first Dolby Vision-compatible long throw projector. Both devices have Google TV onboard, ensuring they\u2019ll be relatively plug-and-play.\nOf course, the battle for eyeballs is not restricted to the living room, with the world of esports commanding vast engagement. In clear recognition of this market, LG is demonstrating what it claims is an \u2018industry first\u2019 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display, an ultra-high refresh rate coupled with the fastest response time (0.03ms) of any panel on the market today.\nCES 2024: LG Display unveils industry\u2019s first 480Hz QHD gaming OLED display\nLG Display is set to launch the 27-inch 480Hz QHD Gaming OLED display during the first half of the year. The company will unveil its full lineup of Gaming OLED displays in sizes 27, 31.5, 34, 39, and 45 inches at CES 2024 as it announces its entry into the high-end gaming display market.\n\u201cTo strengthen our leadership in the high-end gaming display market, we will continue to harness the power of OLED\u2019s distinctive qualities such as ultra-high refresh rates, fast response times, and perfect black for next-level viewing experiences,\u201d said Won-seok Kang, Vice President and Head of the Large Display Product Planning Division at LG Display.\nMeanwhile, gaming brand Razer is promising two gaming world firsts at CES2024, in the shape of a brace of laptops with a 18-inch 4K display that\u2019s capable of running at up to 165Hz and a 16-inch 240Hz OLED respectively.\nAlso worthy of note is Acer\u2019s Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition, which offers glasses-free 3D at a more affordable level than ever before - though whether this will attract developers and buyers is another matter.\nInterestingly, LG is also tackling the content side of the equation, displaying a\u00a0new lineup of \u2018LG MyView\u2019 smart monitors. The monitors have\u00a0webOS platform\u00a0baked in, so that users can stream content and listen to music without connecting to a PC, and feature\u00a0LG IPS 4K displays to boot.\nThey might not be new technologies, and certainly the hype around mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) has proved to be a slow-burner, but 2024 is set to be the year of XR. With Apple\u2019s Vision Pro set for launch early in the year, the market will be on tenterhooks to capitalise on the renewed interest, which will also centre around the Qualcomm XR2+ Gen2 VR chip. That chipset is apparently at the heart of a Samsung/Google XR headset, of which much is rumoured and little known for sure, but a launch date of late 2024 is often mentioned.\nUnsurprisingly, AI is set to be a key player at CES2024 - \u2018front and center\u2019 as the organisers put it, with examples from exhibitors as diverse as Garmin, Intel, Qualcomm and Walmart - the latter three likely to incorporate AI into their respective keynotes. Other touchpoints include a presentation on \u2018Great Minds, Bold Visions: What\u2019s Next for AI?\u2019, \u2018Emerging Technologies Shaping the Tech Workforce\u2019 and research that will outline \u2018Technology and AI Building a Sustainable, Secure, Superior Future\u2019.\nAI may be big business, but the classic Asimov-era artificial intelligence requires a humanoid automaton, which might not be particularly practical, but always steals the show, as Tesla has proved several times, most recently with the Optimus 2.\nCES2024 will star the Kepler Humanoid Robot, a 178cm (5 \u201910\u201d), 85kg (187 lbs.) humanoid bot with a dexterous hand capable of 12 degrees of freedom. Kepler\u2019s series of humanoid robots are apparently poised to enter mass production and commence shipping in Q3 2024, priced at approximately US$30,000.\nCES has long been a guiding light in the automotive tech sphere, and 2024 looks to be no different, with Honda announcing that it will be showing off new EVs at the event. Toyota and Hyundai are likely to make a splash too.\nCES 2024: LG M4\nOne announcement from set-top boxes (STB) and smart TV software firm 3SS features the integration of Dolby Atmos into an automotive entertainment platform, 3Ready Automotive, highlighting the potential applications for immersive entertainment in-vehicle.\nThe CES2024 demo will feature German VOD service maxdome\u2019s Dolby Atmos-enriched programming and will allow automakers to bring premium studio content via maxdome to all their cars with streamlined technical integration and certification. The Dolby Atmos-capable 3Ready entertainment platform can be deployed and scaled across Android Automotive OS, Linux, QNX and AOSP (Android Automotive Open Source Project).\n\u201cTogether with Dolby and 3SS, we\u2019re enabling carmakers to bring the latest premium video content to their customers with the most immersive audio experience,\u201c commented Hans D. Henseleit, CEO at maxdome.\nAs well as big tech names, a selection of media industry stars are also set to shine at the show, with the prospective cast including Robert Downey Jr, Game of Thrones Producers David Benioff and Daniel Brett Weiss, Blake Griffin and Ryan Kalil of Mortal Media, Chiara and Bianca D\u2019Ambrosio of Mirror Image Films, entrepreneur Mark Cuban, content creators from T-Pain to Wu-Tang Clan, Ludacris and almost inevitably, Will.i.am.\nRead more\u00a0What to Expect in 2024: Womens Sport Bid Wars, AI and the Olympics\nTopics\nAdvertisement\nNo comments yet\nOnly registered users can comment on this article.\nRelated articles\nCES2024 Review: What We Learned\n2024-01-18T13:31:00Z\nBy Mark Mayne\nThe established bellwether of the tech industry, CES2024 has delivered in its usual frenetic style.
