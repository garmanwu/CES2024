        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Hands On: Lenovo's ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid Is Two Systems in One\nLike a Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing, this detachable hybrid features both a second processor and even a second OS with seamless switching between the two.\nIf you\u2019re after laptop buying advice, I\u2019m your man. I\u2019ve been reviewing PCs and technology products for more than a decade. I cut my teeth in PC Labs, spending several years with PCMag.com before writing for other outlets, among them LaptopMag.com and Tom\u2019s Guide. While computers are my main focus, I\u2019ve also written at length about topics ranging from fitness gear and appliances to TV and home theater equipment. If I\u2019ve used it, I have opinions about it, whether somebody\u2019s paying me to write them up or not.\nLAS VEGAS\u2014Lenovo just put the \"two\" in 2-in-1 in an all new way at CES 2024 with the Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid system, which combines a Windows 11 laptop with a detachable Android tablet. That's right, it's got Windows and Android devices combined, and the results are deeply intriguing.\nAs a laptop, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid uses an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, running Windows 11. With up to 32GB of memory and 1TB of SSD storage, it's a capable laptop and not so different from other 2-in-1 designs we've seen. With the display attached, the laptop has a 14-inch 2.8K-resolution OLED display to show off. The port selection looks decent enough, with two Thunderbolt 4 connections and an audio jack, and the touch-screen display supports both finger and pen input.\nBut the top half of the detachable is more than just a display: It's also a standalone Android tablet. The 14-inch, 2.8K OLED tablet has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ processor inside and runs Android 13. With 12GB of memory and 256GB of storage in the tablet alone, it's a formidable device in its own right.\nLenovo Brings the Voltron Dream to Life\nThe two systems then merge, Voltron-like, with a magnetic docking connection at the laptop hinge. When paired and docked, they function as a standard Windows laptop. Pull it off of the laptop, and it functions as a standalone Android tablet, but with a twist: You can still use the base and tablet together.\nAndroid has its own ecosystem of apps and capabilities, but Lenovo has added a special operating system (OS) streaming feature that lets you continue to access apps and files from your Windows machine when the tablet is in Android mode.\nThe Windows PC half, on the other hand, can either run as a standalone PC, connected to an external monitor, or be used as a wireless keyboard and touchpad for the Android tablet. The tablet can access the files on your Windows machine (the keyboard), so you have no need to worry about losing data access when you switch to tablet mode.\nYou'll also find a screen mirroring option that lets you use the detached tablet as a separate display for the Windows system, or a picture-in-picture option that lets you access the Android apps and functions of the tablet when the two halves are docked together in laptop mode.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nComputing Duality Without Dichotomy\nIt's a dizzying number of hardware and software combinations, with the choice of OS, and various options for pairing the laptop and tablet halves for continuous use, whether together or apart. The result of all these options is hopefully a new level of usability and seamless capability no matter how you want to use your machine.\nThe question for any dual-OS system, of course, is whether the interactions between the two are smooth and useful enough to justify dealing with whatever rough spots remain. We will withhold judgment until we get a chance to test it ourselves, but that factor should be kept in mind by anyone intrigued by this dual-system 2-in-1.\nWe're looking forward to getting this into the labs for hands-on testing, but we might wait a while. The Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is coming sometime this summer, with an expected starting price of $1,999. That's actually not a bad price considering that you get both a powerful Windows laptop with an OLED display and a 14-inch Android tablet, with keyboard and pen support.

Additionally, these new laptops will take advantage of Lenovo's Smart Power feature that boosts performance and battery life, as well as the Smart Wireless feature that improves Wi-Fi strength and minimizes lag.\nAmong the new laptops, you'll find the IdeaPad 5 2-in-1 and the IdeaPad 5i 2-in-1, both of which are offered with a smaller 14-inch display or a larger 16-inch display. Then, there's the incredibly thin IdeaPad Slim 5i, the first 15.3-inch (16:10) display form factor in Lenovo's IdeaPad lineup. All laptops except for the Slim 5i can be decked out with a gorgeous OLED display.\nWe're on the scene in Las Vegas to check out the latest tech at this year's\u00a0CES\u00a02024 showcase. Be sure to tag along on our CES 2024 journey by following Laptop Mag on\u00a0TikTok,\u00a0Twitter/X,\u00a0Instagram,\u00a0Flipboard, and\u00a0Facebook\u00a0for the most up to date hands-on impressions and news coming from the convention floor.\nLenovo IdeaPad Slim 5i\nThe IdeaPad Slim 5i is an upgrade over Lenovo's IdeaPad Slim 3i in every way.

All IdeaPad Slim 5i models will be equipped with Windows 11, Intel Integrated Graphics, a dual microphone array, two 2W user-facing speakers with Dolby Audio, and a 76Whr polymer battery.\nThere's an HDMI 1.4 port, two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, an audio jack, and a microSD card reader.

The 14-inch IdeaPad 5i offers similar display options, letting users choose between a WUXGA (1920 x 1200) OLED display (60Hz, 400 nits) and a WUXGA (1920 x 1200) IPS display (60Hz, 300 nits).\nBoth laptops are equipped with two 2W user-facing speakers with Dolby Audio, two USB-C ports, two USB-A ports, a microSD card reader, an HDMI 1.4b port, and an audio jack.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nLenovo's Slims and Yogas get Intel and AMD refreshes at CES 2024 with new chips.\nSome use Intel's latest 15W parts.\nLenovo's high-end Yoga laptops are seeing a significant refresh thanks to a slew of new chips. At CES 2024, the company revealed eight new laptops in the Yoga lineup, with six using Intel's new Intel Core Ultra processors, while the other two are relying on AMD's Ryzen 8040 series and Intel's latest U-series chips.\nLenovo's flagship Yoga devices for this year are the Yoga Pro 9i and Yoga 9i 2-in-1. The laptop is a 16-inch device that pairs up to an Intel Core 9 Ultra H-series processor with a discrete GPU up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070, along with up to 64GB of LPDDR5X RAM and 1TB of SSD storage. The 16-inch, 3200 x 2000 touchscreen display runs at 165 Hz and comes in either Mini-LED or IPS options.\nThe 2-in-1, which is Intel Evo certified, uses a Core Ultra 7 155H with integrated Arc graphics, along with 16GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. Its 75 WHr battery is smaller than the 84 WHr cell on the vanilla Pro 9i. It also uses a smaller 14-inch OLED display. You can get it either at 2880 x 1800 at 120 Hz or 3840 x 2400 at 60 Hz. The 2-in-1 comes with a stylus and a sleeve in the box. Both of these notebooks are sticking with Wi-Fi 6E and offer 5-megapixel IR webcams, and they both get Dolby Atmos speakers, keyboards with 1.5 mm of travel, and noise-canceling microphones.\nBoth the Yoga Pro 9i and Yoga 9i 2-in-1 are planned to ship in April, with the Pro starting at $1,699.99 and the 2-in-1 beginning at $1,449.99.\nOne step down, you can find the Yoga Pro 7i and Yoga Pro 7, a pair of 14.5-inch clamshell laptops that have identical chassis designs, but some spec differences you'll want to be careful considering. The 7i, however, won't \u00a0be available in North America \u2014 Lenovo says it is \"expected\" to be available in the EMEA region, but hasn't announced price. The Yoga Pro 7 is also set for April beginning at $1,349.99.\nThe Yoga Pro 7i (the I is for Intel) you get up to an Intel Core Ultra 9H series chip with graphics options up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4050 Laptop GPU, along with up to 32GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage, as well as a 73 WHr battery. There are three display options: 2560 x 1600 at 90 Hz with a matte finish, 2880 x 1800 OLED at 120 Hz, and a 3072 x 1920 touchscreen at at 120 Hz.\nThe AMD version, the Yoga Pro 7, goes up to an AMD Ryzen 8845HS, but with a last gen discrete graphic option, the RTX 3050. It also tops out at half the RAM of the Intel model (16GB), but shares the same storage (up to 1TB) and battery (73 WHr).\nThe Yoga Pro 7's display options are ever-so-slightly different. While the first 2560 x 1600 option is the same, there is a second version with a touch screen. The AMD version doesn't have a 2880 x 1800 OLED option like Intel, and its 3072 x 1920 display is matte rather than being a touchscreen.\nBoth laptops are the same size (3.2 pounds, 0.61 inches thick), have the same teal and gray colors, and support 1080p webcams and Wi-Fi 6E. Of course, Intel's model supports Thunderbolt 4 alongside USB Type-C, while the AMD version swaps it out for USB 4.0.\nSlims, Dual Screens, and Intel 2-in-1s\nLenovo is also using the new chips announced here in Las Vegas to revamp its dual-screen laptop, the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. The new generation goes up to Intel's latest U-series processor, paired with integrated Iris Xe graphics, up to 32GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage. You get two 13.3-inch 2880 x 1800 OLED touch screens on either side of a rotating soundbar, just like what we saw on last year's model. The new version will ship in April starting at $1,999.99.\nThere's also one premium laptop outside of Lenovo's Yoga family: the new Lenovo Slim 7i. \u00a0This notebook is 0.6 inches thick and packs up to an Intel Core Ultra 7 155H, Arc graphics, up to 32GB of RAM and up to 1TB of storage and is powered by a \u00a065 WHr battery. The 14-inch screen is a 1920 x 1200, 60 Hz Dolby Vision panel, with both matte and touch options. Expect to see it in April starting at $1,049.99.\nLastly, there are two mid-level Yoga 7i 2-in-1s: a 14-inch (starting at $849.99) and 16-inch (starting at $899.99) machine, both set for April. Both are Intel Evo certified and go up to Intel Core Ultra 7 processors, with up to 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage, as well as 71 WHr batteries. (Lenovo's spec sheet suggests a U15 chip, perhaps suggesting the new Core 7 150U as an option.) Both of these laptops also feature dedicated keys to utilize Microsoft's Copilot in Windows 11.\nThe 16-inch 2-in-1 has a 1920 x 1200, 60 Hz touchscreen as the sole option, while the 14-incher is more complicated. There's a 2880 x 1800, 120 Hz OLED screen, a 14-inch, 1920 x 1200, 60 Hz OLED screen, and a 1920 x 1200, 60 Hz standard LCD as options.Both share the same speakers, Wi-Fi 6E support and 360-degree hinge, but the 16-incher has a 2MP webcam, while the 14-inch version is stuck at 1080p. Both come in gray, but the 14-inch 2-in-1 will also be available in teal, which I appreciate.\nBeyond all of these laptops, Lenovo is also launching a series of new IdeaPad 2-in-1s and clamshell laptops with Intel's new Core U series and AMD's latest processors.\nStay on the Cutting Edge\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

These noise-canceling headphones incorporate electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, tracking brainwaves and stress levels. It is a fusion of audio technology and health monitoring.\nFor gamers, the ASUS ROG Falchion RX Low Profile keyboard presents a full-size mechanical keyboard with reduced click noises. Compatible with both Windows and Mac, it offers volume and media controls along with a touch panel for added functionality.\nStepping into the augmented reality realm, Asus AirVision M1 stands out with its smart glasses that connect to smartphones or PCs, offering a 1080p Micro OLED display with built-in speakers and a touchpad.\nJBL wowed the audience with the JBL Clip 5, a Bluetooth speaker boasting 10% more bass and an impressive 24-hour battery life on a single charge.
