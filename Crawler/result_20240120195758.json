        "raw_content": "SHARGE Flow Mini Hands-On at CES 2024: A Tiny yet Mighty \u2018Power Backpack\u2019 for your Smartphone\nPower banks have a reputation for being bulky. Nobody really likes carrying them in their pockets given how large and heavy they can be, which often means most power banks spend all their time inside backpacks and purses. The Flow Mini, from Sharge (formerly Shargeek) has a different story to tell. It\u2019s extremely handy, with a compact design that fits into pockets and even around your belt loop (should you choose) and a 5000mAh battery that\u2019s enough to charge your phone. It also boasts a nifty transparent outer design that makes it the kind of power bank you wouldn\u2019t mind flaunting to people around you. Measuring just about as wide as your smartphone, the Flow Mini practically \u2018piggybacks\u2019 onto your smartphone\u2019s form factor, blending right into its design in ways that most power banks don\u2019t.\nDesigner: SHARGE\nClick Here to Buy Now\nOver the years, Sharge has pretty much nailed its core design DNA, focusing on functionality combined with a unique design that uses transparency to help create curiosity and a feeling of being able to see products for what they are. Sharge\u2019s products aren\u2019t for mere masses, they\u2019re more aimed at people with a distinct penchant for design and power-use, as seen with their Shargeek 170, a whopping prism-shaped 170W charger with a transparent design and an LCD screen that lets you accurately measure the power output delivered to each port (along with things like battery percentage and other data-points). The Flow Mini, albeit too small to have its own display, comes with a transparent outer housing and a cylindrical base that\u2019s reminiscent of pencil batteries or a roll of camera film (if you\u2019re from that generation).\nDesigned to plug right into the base of your phone, it comes with an integrated port that lets the power bank itself attach to your device. This makes things a lot easier because you don\u2019t need to hunt for a charging cable to connect your phone and power bank. However, the Flow Mini DOES have a cable that doubles as a lanyard or loop-grip when not actively in use.\nThe Sharge Flow Mini comes equipped with a tiny yet mighty 5000mAh battery that\u2019s more than enough to take your dead smartphone from 0 to 100, or to juice your battery multiple times in the day for that extra boost.\nThe tiny design blends right into your phone\u2019s overall form factor, allowing you to hold/ use your phone even with the Flow Mini attached. Perfect for people who prefer not carrying around a 10,000mAh brick along with them everywhere.\nGiven the fact that the world is still divided by USB-C and Lightning users (and will be for at least the next 4-5 years), the Flow Mini offers the option to alternate between USB-C and Lightning variants. The battery unit stays the same between both designs, with the only change being the primary port on the front. However, Sharge lets you detach the primary port and swap between USB-C or Lightning variants. Meanwhile, a lanyard/loop cable sits on the side, letting you charge another device simultaneously, or charge the Flow Mini itself by directly plugging it into a power outlet.\nTh Flow Mini is Sharge\u2019s smallest charger, but its size shouldn\u2019t be taken for granted. While Sharge does make larger, powerful, and more feature-rich charging banks for the tech-nerd and power-user, the Flow Mini is perfect for on-the-go battery. In fact, the folks at Sharge call it your phone\u2019s second battery, because plug it in place and it sits flush against your device, adding power to it without adding all that extra bulk and weight!\nClick Here to Buy Now\nRelated Posts\nMinimalist wall-hanging CD Player visualizes your music in a unique way\nAlthough digital music, especially through streaming channels, has become the most common way to listen to music these days, they are hardly the only options\u2026\nTop 10 Minimalist Japanese Design Gifts to Enhance Your Daily Life\nThe Japanese design philosophy is appreciated and loved by everyone as it is efficient, detailed, and super organized.

        "raw_content": "SHARGE Icemag Hands-On at CES 2024: A Cool-looking MagSafe Power Bank that Cools your Phone\nTouted as the world\u2019s first power-bank with its own turbo-cooling feature, the Icemag power bank keeps itself (and your phone) breezy while charging. An ultra-silent fan moves at speeds of 8000 RPM, actively cooling the battery pack inside while the Icemag wirelessly charges your phone, preventing anything from heating up during the charging process.\nSharge has pretty much solidified its reputation for building some of the most incredible-looking charging equipment of our time. Whether it\u2019s the transparent 170W power bank with its own LED display, or the tiny yet indomitable Flow Mini power bank that\u2019s small enough to blend right into your phone\u2019s design, becoming its dedicated second battery, Sharge\u2019s built a rather wonderful ecosystem of charging gear that\u2019s both powerful and unmistakably eye-catching. The Icemag joins that ecosystem as a first for both Sharge and the world \u2013 the 10,000mAh MagSafe battery pack comes with its own active cooling system that pushes hot air out from around the lithium-ion battery, increasing its life and overall efficiency as it charges your phone. It also comes as a rather opportune time, as Apple silently killed its own MagSafe power bank, leaving a void in the marketplace.\nDesigner: SHARGE\nClick Here to Buy Now\nThe Icemag has the same proportions as Apple\u2019s MagSafe power bank, albeit with that aforementioned cooling system and a whopping 10,000mAh battery that charges your entire phone twice over with enough extra juice left to spare for a third charge. It sports Sharge\u2019s unmistakable aesthetic, with a transparent panel on the front that lets you peer into the electronics inside \u2013 namely the lithium ion battery, the PCB, and that active cooling system.\nThe active cooling system kicks in the second the Icemag is connected to a device (whether through MagSafe or via USB-C cable). The tiny fan outputs an impressive 8000 RPM, helping circulate air within the Icemag to keep the battery actively cooled (rather than relying on a metal heat-sink like other charging apparatus). The fan operates at a deadly silent <25dB, and it was practically inaudible in the buzz and chatter of the CES floor. What was noticeable, however, was the RGB lighting around the fan that changed colors as the Icemag juiced your device. It served as a nice visual indicator of the Icemag\u2019s activity, especially given Sharge\u2019s tech-geek and gamer-centric audience.\nThe compact power bank snaps satisfyingly onto the back of your MagSafe phone, beginning the charging process instantly. An indicator on the side shows exactly how much power the Icemag\u2019s battery still has, while a USB-C port on the base supports both power in as well as out. This means the USB-C port can be used to charge the Icemag itself or can be used to connect the Icemag to another phone to charge it conventionally (without using the MagSafe wireless charging feature). The Icemag supports pass-through charging too, letting you charge it while it wirelessly juices your smartphone, and as far as charging speeds go, the Icemag\u2019s wireless charging coil outputs a maximum 7.5W. If you want to tap into higher speeds, connecting your phone/device via USB-C gives you an output of 20W, charging your gadgets significantly faster for when you\u2019re in a bind.\nThe Icemag balances its responsibilities of being handy, eye-catching, and functional rather well. It\u2019s compact for its capacity and weighs just 223 grams (7.9 ounces), allowing it to securely attach to the back of your phone without any problems. The 10,000mAh battery is absolutely perfect for people who blow through their phones during the day, giving you an extra battery that can support your phone multiple times. The transparent aesthetic and active cooling system, however, steal the limelight for the gorgeous nerdy-cool aesthetic they give the Icemag. The term nerdy-cool probably gets used literally in this sense because of the Icemag\u2019s ability to keep itself at manageable temperatures as it charges your phone. I dare you to find a MagSafe power bank that\u2019s as gorgeously functional as this one\u2026\nClick Here to Buy Now\nRelated Posts\nMinimalist wall-hanging CD Player visualizes your music in a unique way\nAlthough digital music, especially through streaming channels, has become the most common way to listen to music these days, they are hardly the only options\u2026\nTop 10 Minimalist Japanese Design Gifts to Enhance Your Daily Life\nThe Japanese design philosophy is appreciated and loved by everyone as it is efficient, detailed, and super organized.

        "raw_content": "Navitas and SHARGE Upgrade 100W Fast Charging: 60% Smaller than Legacy Silicon\nby Navitas | Aug 27, 2021 | Front Page, In the Media, Latest News, Press Releases\nNext-generation gallium nitride design delivers simultaneous fast-charging for 4 mobile devices.\nDUBLIN, IRELAND \u2014 (PRNewswire) Navitas Semiconductor, the industry leader in gallium nitride (GaN) power ICs, announced the launch of the upgraded SHARGE 100W GaN Charger Pro. This exciting, powerful fast charger is a huge 60% smaller than legacy silicon 4-output chargers. The next-generation design is also another 12% smaller than the 2020 GaN model, with optimized design and performance to bring consumers an even better charging experience. With 3x USB Type-C and 1x USB Type-A outputs, the GaN Pro can simultaneously fast-charge 4 mobile devices, from earbuds and smartphones up to the 16\u201d Apple MacBook Pro using dynamic power sharing to optimize charging speeds.\nGallium nitride (GaN) is a next-generation semiconductor technology that runs up to 20x faster than legacy silicon chips. Navitas\u2019 proprietary GaN power ICs integrate GaN power (FET) and GaN drive plus control and protection in a single SMT package. These \u2018GaNFast\u00ae\u2019 power ICs become easy-to-use, high-speed, high-performance \u2018digital-in, power-out\u2019 building blocks and deliver up to 3x faster charging in half the size and weight, and with up to 40% energy savings compared with earlier silicon solutions. An estimated $13.1B electrification opportunity includes mobile fast chargers and adapters, data centers, solar energy, and EV.\nBy exploiting the high-speed, high-efficiency performance of GaNFast technology, the 100W GaN Pro measures only 77 x 59 x 29 mm (131 cc) to achieve a power density of 0.76 W/cc at a lightweight 220 g, and retails for only 535 RMB (approx. ~$83). The 100W GaN Pro shares the same, \u2018industrial\u2019 design style as its predecessor, now with a bold, bright yellow and gray color scheme.\nThe 100W SHARGE GaN Charger Pro features three USB-C ports and one USB-A port, supporting PD/QC/PPS and other common protocols. The C1 and C2 ports alone can deliver up to 100W of power, while the C3 and A1 ports alone can deliver up to 20W and 22.5W respectively. When multiple interfaces are used simultaneously, the GaN Charger Pro can provide power to different devices through dynamic power distribution. With four charging ports, users can replace four, regular silicon single-port chargers with one charger, saving bulk, weight and precious AC-outlets.\n\u201cAs a company pursuing the ultimate in products, SHARGE has always wanted to provide consumers with a more extreme product experience,\u201d said Bo Zhang, founder of SHARGE. \u201cThanks to the world-leading integrated GaNFast power IC from Navitas, and the efforts of engineers from both SHARGE and XinSPower, the 100W GaN charger Pro can maintain full 100W power while further reducing its size, allowing consumers to further enhance their charging experience.\u201d\nThe powerful SHARGE 100W GaN Charger Pro uses GaNFast power ICs in two high-speed, \u2018soft-switching\u2019 topologies to achieve the impressive size and weight reductions. The first is a CrCM boost power-factor correction (PFC) circuit, using Navitas NV6127 (125m\u03a9) GaN power ICs to convert rectified AC power to a stable 400V DC rail. This is followed by a high-speed, isolating, \u2018LLC\u2019 DC -DC stage with two NV6115 (170m\u03a9) ICs to efficiently step-down the voltage to ~20V for the USB-PD output stages. A single system-controller IC (MPS HR1211) operates both circuits. The GaNFast ICs are rated at 650/800V, and up to 2MHz switching frequency in small QFN SMT packages. Thanks to the integration of GaN FET, GaN drive, protection and control, no external drivers are needed which saves PCB space, and high-speed (switching-frequency) operation shrinks the size and cost of transformers, filters and capacitors.\n\u201cWhether it\u2019s the 100W GaN Charger Pro or the Super Mobile Power, announced at the same launch event, SHARGE pushes the limits of product specification, design and quality,\u201d said Stephen OLIVER, VP of corporate marketing and investor relations at Navitas Semiconductors. \u201cGaNFast delivers considerable room for innovation in the hands of manufacturers like SHARGE, who pursue the ultimate in product designs, bringing consumers a charging experience beyond imagination.\u201d\n\u201cAs a pioneer in GaN fast charging, with rich experience in design, production, certification and launch, XinSPower has become the \u2018go-to\u2019 partner for Asus, IDMIX, Baseus, SHARGE, ZENDURE, MOMAX and other brands,\u201d said Xianqing LIU, General Manager of XinSPower. \u201cGaN will be used in more high-power charging and more diversified charging devices in the future. XinSPower and Navitas will jointly come up with GaN-enabled products \u2013 e.g. wireless charger, power strips, mobile power and other more diversified charging applications \u2013 to help major brands to create breakthrough models.\u201d\nAbout SHARGE Technology:\nFounded in 2020, SHARGE (\u95ea\u6781, Shine Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd) is an industry-leading innovator in charging and energy storage products. With advanced technology, accurate demand insight, and excellent component partners, the US crowdfunding project planned by SHARGE broke through $150,000 in sales when it was first launched.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 CES, the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s annual trade show of all-things tech, is kicking off in Las Vegas this week.\nThe multi-day event, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, is set to feature swaths of the industry\u2019s latest advances and gadgets across personal tech, transportation, health care and more \u2014 with burgeoning uses of artificial intelligence almost everywhere you look.\nThe Consumer Technology Association bills CES as the world\u2019s largest audited tech event held in-person. Organizers hope to bring in some 130,000 attendees this year. More than 4,000 exhibitors, including over 1,200 startups, are also expected across 2.5 million net square feet of exhibit space.\nThat\u2019s still below the headcounts of pre-pandemic years and would mark a 24% dip in attendance compared to the show held in early 2020, just before COVID-19 consumed much of everyday life. But 2024 is on track to beat more recent years. The anticipated numbers would surpass 2023\u2019s nearly 118,000 attendees, for example.\n\u201cPeople are pumped for this. They\u2019re pumped because it\u2019s post-COVID (and) they\u2019re coming back,\u201d Gary Shapiro, president and CEO of the Consumer Technology Association, said. \u201cAnd the CEO level support from around the world has been amazing.\u201d\nBig names set to exhibit at CES this year range from tech giants and automakers to leading cosmetics brands \u2014 including Amazon, Google, Honda, Mercedes-Benz and L\u2019Oreal. The show will also spotlight the Consumer Technology Association\u2019s partnership with the United Nations Human Security for All campaign, which recently added technology as its eighth human security pillar.\nAfter two days of media previews, CES will run from Tuesday through Friday. The show is not open to the general public -- it\u2019s a business-to-business event often used for industry professionals to network and connect.\nThe Associated Press spoke with Shapiro about CES 2024 and what to expect this week. The conversation has been edited for clarity and length.\nCES 2024 IS HERE. WHAT ARE THE MAIN THEMES OF THIS YEAR\u2019S SHOW?\nThe overall theme of the show, in a sense, is sustainability. It\u2019s green. It\u2019s the U.N. human securities \u2014 including those that focus on clean air, clean water, food as well as health care. And the U.N. just added a new one, which is technology itself. The show is built around these human securities.\nFrom mobility to health care, the exhibiting companies are providing solutions in the post-COVID world. We\u2019re also getting older, we\u2019re living longer and there\u2019s fewer people to take care of us. Technology is the answer.\nAI IS EVERYWHERE THIS YEAR. HOW MUCH SAFETY OVERSIGHT IS THERE ON THE DEVICES WE\u2019LL SEE IN THE COMING DAYS?\nAI is like the internet itself. It\u2019s a huge ingredient that will propel so much innovation. The difference is now generative AI, which can learn from what you\u2019ve done. And you can apply that to so many different aspects of what we do that will make our lives better \u2014 especially in a health care area.\nLike any tool since the invention of fire, the government plays a very big role in making sure there are certain safety barriers. We\u2019ve been working with the U.S. Senate and they\u2019ve been hearing from every interested party about what we need \u2014 including a national privacy law. AI is a tool and it can be used for doing tremendous good, or it could be used for doing harm. And we want to focus on the good.\nAUTOMAKERS ALSO HAVE A BIG SPOTLIGHT AT CES. CAN WE EXPECT ANY IMPACT FROM THE RECENT UAW STRIKE?\nIn terms of a trade event, this is like the biggest car event in the world. We see car companies from all over the world on the floor.\nThey will be there in different ways, and some choose not to be here for one reason or another. Certainly the strike had an impact for some of the Detroit companies, but the rest of the companies from around the world are very strong \u2014 notably from Europe, Vietnam and Japan.\nWE SAW VIDEO GAME EXPO E3 BITE THE DUST LAST MONTH. WHAT ROLE DO TRADE SHOWS PLAY TODAY AND HOW CAN CES\u2019S FUTURE BE ENSURED?\nSince COVID, trade shows have actually become more important for business leaders \u2014 because they understand and appreciate that relationship-building. That face-to-face time is very important. A person who goes to CES, for example, has on average 29 different meetings. What is more efficient than that?\nAnd then there\u2019s something you can\u2019t get online, which is serendipity. It\u2019s discovery. It\u2019s learning what you don\u2019t know and it\u2019s being inspired. Someone said to me on the way here, \u201cI love going to CES because I come back optimistic for the world. I come back with 50 ideas and it energizes me.\u201d And that\u2019s what\u2019s so important. I think we have a great future, and innovation is going to be what fuels us. And we will get there by gathering the world\u2019s innovators together.\n_____________\nVideo producer James Brooks contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.
