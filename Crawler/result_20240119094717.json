        "raw_content": "Yeyian Gaming shows their latest Gaming Solutions at CES 2024\nIntroduction\nYeyian Gaming is a custom boutique PC builder offering a variety of custom gaming PCs either was a pre-configured option or fully custom using their online configuration tool.\u00a0 As with most boutique system builds they are using off the shelf components which can make their systems great for upgrades later but, also allows Yeyian Gaming the opportunity to include a number of personalized components in their builds to really make them stand out.\nAt CES 2024 Yeyian Gaming was showing many of their custom hardware options including one-of-a-kind chassis designs and several branded components from power supplies to gaming headsets and monitors.\nThe highlight for me was the Yeyian Gaming Conquer headset and headphone stand.\u00a0 Conquer is a fully wireless dual mode headset with Active Noise Cancelling.\u00a0 This is an on ear design with extremely soft to ensure a great fit and good clamping force for users on the go.\u00a0 When used in wireless mode the battery can last up to 35 hours and offers a range up to 10m.\nOf course to add some lighting outside your computer the RGB headphone stand is a nice accessory and acts as an extension hub for charging and data access.\nAnother highlight for me was the Mirage X PC gaming chassis.\u00a0 This case is like most cases,\u00a0 it supports triple fan radiators , has the power supply at the bottom and comes with RGB however,\u00a0 the front bezel is rather unique featuring six edge lit acrylic panels instead of a full coverage bezel.\u00a0 From a cooling standpoint this is provides minimal restriction while also offering maximum RGB.\nAssuming you are into that sort of thing.\nThe build on display featured a Core i9 14900k, Strix RTX 4090 and Yeyian Orion 1300w PSU.\nOne component that is often overlooked is the power supply and Yeyian Gaming offers a branded solution called Orion.\u00a0 The Orion series comes with a custom chassis design and is color matched to their custom PC cases.\u00a0 As you would expect the 1600w also comes with dual 12VHWR connections.\nWhile a proper gaming computer is a key component the individual accessories are what transform the experience into something enjoyable.\u00a0 For this, Yeyian gaming offers an entire range of accessories which can cater to just about anyone.\nTheir latest stream ready microphone is very compact and features dual connections including standard USB for most everyone and XLR for those using a professional audio interface.\u00a0 This is also a dynamic microphone which can offer a natural noise reduction and comes with easily accessible controls.\nMonitors included the 25\u201d Proact series.\u00a0 This monitor is offering the popular 1440p resolution in a much smaller form factor and features a 360hz IPS panel.\u00a0 For those looking at a widescreen curved monitor Yeyian had this 45\u201d OLED featuring a 240hz refresh rate on display.\nThe new Yeyian Gaming ergonomic gaming chair features a refreshing design that has a racing seat aesthetic but with unique pad placements.\u00a0 These thicker pads are surprisingly comfortable and make the chair feel like a traditional high-back while retaining that racing look.\nBy: Dennis Garcia\nConnect With Us\nCopyright \u00a9 2011 - 2024 by Hardware Asylum, Ninjalane LLC\nAll trademarks used are properties of their respective owners.\nAll rights reserved.\nSite design and front-end production by Ninjalane LLC\nPrivacy Policy and Terms of Use"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 \u2013 Yeyian Showcases Exciting Components\nKnown mainly for their pre-built gaming systems, Yeyian was showing off a wide array of components and peripherals at CES 2024. We have been following this brand closely as they work to grow their brand in the US market, and think that they have a successful future ahead of them. Check out these new products that we encountered while visiting them at the show.\nPalette Series Monitor\nWe have seen a lot of different monitors this year at CES, and Yeyian is part of that assortment. Their 45\u2033 Palette OLED monitor sports a QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution on an 800R curved screen. A 240Hz refresh rate and 0.1ms response time should provide a smooth gaming experience for gamers looking for fast paced action, while the 1000 nits of brightness, 10-bit color, and 99% DCI-P3 rating will ensure there are great visuals to boot from this LG-made panel. For those looking to connect a laptop or mobile device, 65 watts of power delivery is available for keeping those devices charged during use. Input options include a single DisplayPort 1.4 port, two HDMI 2.1 ports, a single USB Type-C with Power Delivery, and three USB Type-A (USB 3.2 Gen1). We expect to see this monitor sometime in Q3 for right around $1,400.\nProact Series Monitors\nAdditionally, Yeyian was showing off a 25\u2033 FHD (1920 x 1080) IPS display from their Proact series. This display has a 360Hz refresh rate paired up with a 1ms reaction time for those fast FPS and MOBA gaming titles. Connectivity options include a single DisplayPort 1.4 port, and two HDMI 2.1 ports. This monitor is already available for purchase, but we wanted to make sure we highlighted it here.\nARGB LCD Panel AIO Cooler\nAnother product that Yeyian is bringing out is an all-in-one liquid cooler for your CPU. Mounted on the pump housing is a 2.1\u2033, 480 x 480 resolution IPS display that can be used to show off your system stats, temperatures, and more. Adding a bit of additional color to this cooler are RGB fans with a maximum speed of 2,600 RPM and up to 72 CFM of airflow. Multiple sizes of this cooler are expected to launch this year starting in April, including 240mm, 360mm, 420mm, and a 480mm version coming later on. Initial pricing for the 240mm is $120, while the 360mm pricing will be set at $139.\nUltra Compact Transparent Keyboard\nDesigned with their own switches inside, Yeyian is bringing out their very own 65% keyboard. The model we saw in person had an awesome transparent body, as well as clear pudding-style keycaps in multiple colors. This wireless keyboard packs an internal battery that can last up to 10 days in standby mode, and also has a one hour fast charging function as well. Wireless connectivity comes in the way of either 2.4GHz wireless via a USB dongle, or Bluetooth with support for connecting up to three different devices. Set to launch in May, this keyboard should retail for $89.\nMechanical Keyboard \u2013 Cherry Switches\nIf you want to go the route of having a keyboard with tried-and-true switches, then Yeyian will also be offering a 75% model with Cherry MX2A Speed Silver switches. Again, this keyboard offers wired, Bluetooth, or 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, giving you plenty of options for integrating this keyboard into your setup(s). Pre-lubricated switches offer an upgraded typing experience compared to non-lubed switches, which is always a nice bonus. With RGB lighting not only on the switches themselves, but surrounding the body of the keyboard, you are able to light up your gaming area as you see fit. A small control dial is placed at the top right of the keyboard for your standard volume control function when needed. No word just yet on pricing or availability.\nDrift Mouse\nIn addition to the keyboards, Yeyian also had two gaming mice on hand to check out, the first being the Drift. Weighing in at just 52 grams, this lightweight mouse features PixArt\u2019s 3395 26k DPI sensor with support for up to an 8,000 Hz polling rate and 0.125ms of latency when using it in the wired mode. If you switch over to the 2.4GHz wireless mode, you get access to a 4,000 Hz polling rate and 0.25ms latency. Available in early 2024, the Drift will sell for $79.\nDominate Mouse\nWith the same Pixart 3395 26k DPI sensor, 8KHz wired polling rate, 4KHz wireless polling rate, and matching 2.4HGz wireless connectivity as the Drift, the Yeyian Dominate gaming mouse is slightly larger, but still comes in at just 58g. With a more extreme cutout pattern in the body of the mouse, the Dominate has a magnesium alloy body for a unique take on gaming mouse design. Coming some time in late March or early April, we should see the Dominate priced at $129.\nMirage X Case\nWhile Yeyian is most well known for their pre-configured systems, they do offer some of their cases for sale as standalone products, including the Mirage X. The Mirage X will be available in both a full ATX size, as well as an mATX size. With room in the larger case for up to 360mm radiators, the coolest part of the Mirage X is the louvered tempered glass front panel. Instead of a flat panel that allows no air to enter via the front of the case, Yeyian has designed the Mirage X to have multiple angled tempered glass strips that run up and down the front of the case. These panels are illuminated by LEDs, and look quite nice, while also allowing for airflow where other cases cut it off due to their solid front panels. The larger version of the case will be ready sometime in February or March of 2024 and will sell for around $150. No word on availability for the smaller version, but expect it to come in right around the $130 mark.\nOur CES 2024 coverage is brought to you by Yeyian!\nYou May Also Like\nThinkComputers \u00a9 2024.
