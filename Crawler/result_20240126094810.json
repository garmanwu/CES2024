        "raw_content": "Mercedes-Benz Shows Off Next-Generation Cars And Tech At CES 2024\nAt CES this year, Mercedes-Benz has shown off a host of updates for its next-generation vehicles and its MBUX infotainment systems. These changes include the use of an AI-powered MBUX Virtual Assistant, a new MB.OS architecture with 3D graphics, and two new collaborations. The first is with will.i.am for in-car audio and sound effects, and the second is with Amazon and Audible, bringing podcasts and audiobooks into Mercedes models.\nA new virtual assistant for MBUX was also shown at CES, with the brand calling it its most \u201chuman-like\u201d interface yet. The system uses generative AI and four different \u201cemotions\u201d to augment the experience, which is also supplemented with \u201cgame engine graphics\u201d and a showcase for Mercedes-branded NFTs. There\u2019s very little substantive information on features this early on, but the brand does say that the system will bring more personalization and that the graphics will be used to further enhance the brand\u2019s excellent Surround Navigation.\nMercedes\u2019 partnership with will.i.am, which is part of an ongoing relationship between the two, has resulted in the creation of MBUX Sound Drive. Again, there\u2019s very little real information about what exactly the software does, but the brand\u2019s press materials suggest it will alter and produce music based on the driver\u2019s inputs - steering, braking, accelerating, and the like. Speaking of in-car audio, the brand\u2019s partnership with Audible and Amazon Music will enhance audiobooks, podcasts, and music with a \u201cconcert-hall sound experience.\u201d\nMercedes-Benz still does cars, and to showcase its new infotainment technology, the Concept CLA-Class is present at CES this year. The new concept rides on the brand\u2019s modular architecture, bringing with it a claimed \u201cmore than 466 miles\u201d of range, new electric motors, 300+ kW fast charging, and of course, the brand\u2019s latest infotainment systems and tech. Mercedes says four vehicles will be based on this modular architecture, including a four-door\ncoupe, a wagon (though this may not come to the States), and two SUVs.\nFinally, the 2024 EQS and S-Class are now available with Drive Pilot, Mercedes\u2019 SAE Level 3 automated driving software. The brand has also said the software can be ordered retroactively via the Mercedes me store, and while the software is only legal and usable in California and Nevada, deliveries will start early this year.\nBecome an AutoGuide insider.

        "raw_content": "AI Assistants, In-Car Gaming And Tons Of Range: Coming To Your Next Mercedes-Benz\nMercedes has some bold, experimental ideas for how your driving experience could feel in the next few years. Will customers bite?\nThe fight for automotive supremacy in the future won't come down to horsepower or mechanical specs. It will probably come down to software; at least, that's what the car companies tell us. That idea may seem radical to anyone driving a car from the last decade who's just happy that their Apple CarPlay or Android Auto setup works so well, but all of the automakers have much bigger, grander plans for what we experience inside their cars than we currently do.\nCase in point: Mercedes-Benz's big announcements at CES 2024 aren't about performance or even electric range this time, but the future software-driven features coming to its cars very soon.\nGallery: Mercedes-Benz CES 2024 Tech Announcements\nThe giant Las Vegas tech show served as a preview for a bevy of Mercedes technologies coming to both its EVs and internal combustion-powered cars starting next year, including its smartest voice-controlled virtual assistant ever thanks to AI; more expansions into in-car gaming; a taste of its new all-encompassing suite, MB.OS; the North American debut of its future electric sedan and Tesla Model 3 competitor; and a unique system co-developed with musician\u00a0will.i.am that \"allows music to react to how the car is being driven,\" in Mercedes' words. (More on that in its own story right here.) Let's dive in.\nGet Fully Charged\nIn-car software and AI is the big story at CES this year\nAfter years of EV and concept car debuts, automakers like Mercedes, Volkswagen and BMW are focused on upping their software game at the tech mega-show in 2024. All car companies have huge plans for revenue through software features, including via subscriptions.\nMB.OS' Party Trick Is Its Virtual Assistant\nIf you've been fortunate enough to experience Mercedes' MBUX software system across all three parts of the Hyperscreen on certain EQ electric cars, you know how powerful and graphically impressive it is. (At least, that's my take.) Equally impressive are the voice controls, where you can say \"Hey, Mercedes\" and get a swift response to most things you need without having to fish through the Hyperscreen's menus when you're on the road.\nTo that, Mercedes says: \"You ain't seen nothing yet.\" The MB.OS system coming soon to the company's all-new MMA platform is a\u00a0purpose-built chip-to-cloud operating system that brings a number of diverse functions under one roof: in-car content, charging, maps, car setting controls and\u00a0automated driving.\nA big part of that will be the MBUX Virtual Assistant, which Mercedes calls \" the most human-like interface with a Mercedes-Benz yet.\" Powered by ChatGPT\u2014something Volkswagen announced today at CES as well\u2014Mercedes' Chief Technology Officer\u00a0Markus Sch\u00e4fer said the system can do more than\u00a0just follow your voice commands. It can have a\u00a0\"dialogue\" with users, and even pick up on the moods they're in to respond with \"empathy.\"\nThe AI has four different personality traits\u2014Natural, Predictive, Personal and Empathetic\u2014that can be adjusted to your personal tastes or situation behind the wheel. The AI Projects as a glowing three-pointed star logo with various color changes and animations to illustrate its state of being. It could glow a certain way when providing a warning, for example, and a different way when it's listening to you.\n\"In some cases, hopefully, the assistant predicts already what you want, depending on your moods, the daytime, the location you are in and the circumstances you are in,\"\u00a0Sch\u00e4fer said. But after an easy conversation,\u00a0Sch\u00e4fer said the assistant \"can address\u00a0whatever you want from your car, whether you want entertainment, you want information and so on.\"\nThe assistant has four different \"emotions\" and can respond to your requests based on your own mood at the time. \"You can have a constant interaction with your car,\"\u00a0Sch\u00e4fer told InsideEVs at a press roundtable earlier today.\nIn other words, this system should do a lot more than just tell you where the nearest charging station is when you say \"Hey, Mercedes.\" It may also commiserate with you about how annoyed you are to be stuck in traffic.\nSurround Navigation Turns Your Driving Experience Into A Video Game\nThese days, it's not uncommon for high-tech EVs to have displays with visualizations of the cars and objects in the surrounding area; Tesla's center screen is arguably the best example of this. But Mercedes is taking this to a different level.\nUsing the Unity game engine, the next-gen cars will offer\u00a0MBUX Surround Navigation: a 3D visualization that allows you to \"see what the car sees,\" as Mercedes puts it. Though your eyes are good at what they do, this system gives more of a bird's-eye view of other cars, trucks, cyclists or even pedestrians\u2014superimposing potential hazards onto the route guidance to help you navigate a tough urban environment beyond just what you yourself can see.\n\"So for example, navigating through downtown traffic, finding a parking spot, knowing where you're going to make your turn\"\u2014all are projected via Surround Navigation, Mercedes' Chief Software Officer Magnus \u00d6stberg said during the press conference. The 3D game engine projects \"all the sensor data that we're taking from the cameras, the radar, the LIDAR, that really gives the driver situational awareness. It's not only\u00a0beautiful graphics but also a safe experience,\" he said.\nThough we weren't offered the chance to experience this for ourselves at CES, it does seem like an impressive evolution of the navigation experience\u2014and a good visualization of much of the data the car normally keeps to itself.\nMore In-Car Gaming Soon\nMercedes also knows you need something to do while you're charging, and at least one answer to that is the video games I had when I was a kid. Bubble Bobble is back, kids. Get excited.\nMercedes announced a wide array of partnerships bringing new music, movies, video games and other content to those giant screens soon. Those include\u00a0Audible and Amazon Music for podcasts and audiobooks, as well as\u00a0Antstream Arcade for retro cloud-based gaming. It's not far off what you can already do with your smartphone, but the native access to these services should provide a nice experience on some much bigger, more high-res screens when you have downtime in the car.\nThe Next CLA Makes Its North American Debut\nThough some early iterations of these features are available on the new 2024 Mercedes E-Class, which runs a \"precursor\" to MB.OS, the real show starts when the car above hits the road next year. That's the Concept CLA Class, which first debuted at IAA Munich in 2023 and is making its first-ever appearance in North America for CES.\nThe final production version of the next CLA isn't expected to veer too far from the concept here, and when it does, it will not only be a Model 3 fighter\u2014something badly needed in an SUV-focused world\u2014but it will debut MB.OS for the first time. That car will also be the first of at least four EVs on the new MMA platform, which, together with MB.OS, represents a much more cohesive transformation of Mercedes than we've seen before. By putting all these technologies together with one software platform, the automaker says it can offer a level of features and personalization it's never been able to before.\nAnd the next CLA is expected to be a mighty EV, not just a computer on wheels. With an 800-volt architecture, an estimated 466 miles of range on Europe's WLTP cycle and the ability to add\u00a0an estimated 248 miles of range in 15 minutes, this should be a winner if it even come close to those claims. Furthermore, with an estimated\u00a05.2 miles per kilowatt-hour, it should be one of the most efficient EVs on the road.\nWe'll see this and more from Mercedes as CES goes on this week.\nContact the author: patrick.george@insideevs.com\nMore Mercedes News\nTrending\nCar Buying Service\nGet upfront price offers on local inventory.\nSearch for:\nlatest articles\nlatest articles\nAbout this article"

The North American network is scheduled for completion by 2027, by which time a total of more than 400 hubs with more than 2,500 high-power chargers will cover the continent. Spaced conveniently at regular intervals close to motorways, major intersections and metropolitan areas, the hubs will offer a premium, sustainable and reliable charging experience.\nMarkus Sch\u00e4fer Member of the Board of Management of Mercedes-Benz Group AG, Chief Technology Officer, Development & Procurement\nHigh-power charging network\nMercedes-Benz to launch global branded high-power charging network, starting in North America.\nVISION EQXX, the most efficient Mercedes-Benz ever built\nVisitors to CES 2023 can take a close look at a life-size model of the VISION EQXX at the Mercedes-Benz booth and learn more about this very special research vehicle. The most efficient Mercedes-Benz ever proved its capabilities last year with multiple drives of more than 1,200 km (745 miles) on a single battery charge. It made headlines last summer with an average energy consumption of 8.3 kilowatt hours per 100 kilometres (or 7.5 miles per kilowatt hour) on a drive from Stuttgart, Germany to Silverstone, U.K.\nAutomatic Lane Change (ALC) feature coming to North American market\nMercedes-Benz also announced the company\u2019s new Automatic Lane Change (ALC)\u00b9 feature, which will come to the North American market this year. ALC enables the car to automatically initiate a lane change and overtake slower vehicles with the cruise control engaged. The system is a further expansion stage of the Mercedes-Benz SAE Level 2 partially automated driving feature, so the driver remains responsible at all times. To use ALC, the driver sets the speed of the adaptive distance cruise control function (Active Distance Assist DISTRONIC). The Active Steering Assist (activated by default) does the rest. The car continuously monitors its surroundings via its array of radar sensors and cameras to overtake slower cars while on the motorway. Having overtaken, the vehicle can assist moving back to the original lane. ALC can also initiate an automatic lane change to help follow the active route guidance when approaching exit ramps or freeway junctions.\nSAE Level 3 conditionally automated driving coming to Nevada and California in 2023\nMercedes-Benz customers will soon be able to benefit from SAE Level 3\u00b2 conditionally automated driving in the U.S. states of California and Nevada. In May 2022, Mercedes-Benz became the first car manufacturer in the world with an internationally valid certification for conditionally automated driving to offer such a system as an option ex-works for vehicles from series production to customers in Germany. On suitable motorway sections and where traffic density is high, DRIVE PILOT can offer to take over the driving, initially up to the legally permitted speed of 60 km/h. This gives customers back time so they can focus on certain secondary activities such as communicating with colleagues via In-Car Office, browsing the web or relaxing while watching a movie. Mercedes-Benz has applied for certification in the states of California and Nevada. DMV Nevada has approved the application and they are now preparing the certificate of compliance that will be issued within the next two weeks. With that, Mercedes-Benz will be the first OEM to have a Level 3 system to offer in the US \u2013 and is optimistic that California will follow soon.\nMore Mercedes-Benz CES Highlights\nMercedes-Benz Chief Software Officer Magnus \u00d6stberg detailed during the CES 2023 tech talks how Mercedes-Benz is creating the ideal in-car entertainment experience with the help of multiple partners. Collaborations with Apple Music, Universal Music Group (UMG) and Dolby Laboratories, Inc. are bringing ground-breaking innovations in the field of sound to Mercedes-Benz vehicles. Thanks to the collaboration with Apple Music, a Mercedes-Benz is now the first non-Apple device to natively offer Spatial Audio with Dolby Atmos by Apple Music. With this new audio standard, Universal Music Group, the world\u2019s largest music label, are enabling their recording artists to base their song approval process on how the final mix sounds in a Mercedes-Benz and introduce the seal \u201cApproved in a Mercedes-Benz\u201d as a gold standard of sound. This is made possible by the integration of Dolby Atmos immersive audio into the optional Burmester\u00ae high-end 4D and 3D sound systems with the latest MBUX generation. UMG additionally plans to set up a studio environment in Sindelfingen, Germany, based on its Capitol Studios\u2019 Studio C, a major global reference music studio for Dolby Atmos mixing.\nMaking its North American premiere, the Mercedes-Benz partnership with digital entertainment platform ZYNC brings seamless in-car content streaming to a new level. Both companies took advantage of the CES 2023 tech talks to announce details of the collaboration, which brings new, curated content and embedded streaming specific to the North American market. Joining Magnus \u00d6stberg was ZYNC founder and CEO Rana June (RJ). She explained how ZYNC combines all streaming services seamlessly on a single platform, allowing passengers to stream content onto their screens while travelling and to all occupants when parked.\nTo round out the day\u2019s discussions, Mercedes-Benz announced a collaboration with the emerging entertainment brand, SUPERPLASTIC. Galen McKamy, Chief Creative Officer of SUPERPLASTIC, joined Alexander Helf, Head of Brand, Design & Lifestyle Communications at Mercedes-Benz, to launch their newly formed partnership at the CES 2023, which included the introduction of an all-new character to the SUPERPLASTIC universe \u2013 Superdackel. He is a cultural icon, derived from the \u201cWackeldackel,\u201d the classic \u201cnodding dog\u201d ornament that\u2019s graced the hearts and dashboards of generations of drivers around the globe. The partners premiered Superdackel in an animated short film.\nThe CES 2023 Mercedes-Benz talks are available as an on-demand video on Mercedes me media\u00a0.\n\u00b9For regulatory reasons, this Level 2 system is currently only available in the USA and Canada. MBUX Navigation is required. The Mercedes-Benz driving assistance and safety systems are aids and do not relieve the driver of responsibility. The driver must observe the instructions in the Owner\u2019s Manual and the system limits described therein.\n\u00b2SAE Level 3: the automated driving function takes over certain driving tasks. However, a driver is still required. The driver must be ready to take control of the vehicle at all times when prompted to intervene by the vehicle.\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group.\nThe Mercedes-Benz Group AG (former Daimler AG) is one of the world's most successful automotive companies. With Mercedes-Benz AG, we are one of the leading global suppliers of high-end passenger cars and premium vans. Mercedes-Benz Mobility AG offers financing, leasing, car subscription and car rental, fleet management, digital services for charging and payment, insurance brokerage, as well as innovative mobility services.\nMore Information\nOverview\nJob Search\nShares\nLocations\nMedia Site\nContact\nESG\nIntellectual Property\nTradition\nTalent Programmes\nPodcasts\nSuppliers\nData & APIs for Developers\nMercedes-Benz Open Source\nWhistleblower System (BPO)\nVehicles\nAccessories\nDigital Extras\nLifestyle Collection\nClassic Cars\n\u00a9 2024 Mercedes-Benz Group AG.

Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast.

Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"
