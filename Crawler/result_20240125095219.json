        "raw_content": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\n'Neural' headphones are big at CES \u2013 here are 4 fascinating products coming soon\nThe latest innovations in headphones tap into auditory nerves\nIncreasingly, competitors for the best headphones aren't just focused on delivering top-quality audio. Every year it seems that new strings are being added to their bow, and a big thing we're seeing in buds and headphones at CES 2024 are 'neural' technologies.\nWe also saw a couple more interesting earbuds pushing the boundaries of headphones tech, including TimeKettle's new multi-device X1 two-way translator earbuds and BREGGZ's in-ear computer wireless earbuds, which also have a translation app. With Samsung also looking to add real-time translation to its next Galaxy Buds, it's safe to say this is a tech we'll be hearing a lot more about.\nBut the idea of headphones being able to read minds is \u2013 in our opinion \u2013 even more outlandish, and therefore interesting. I've rounded up four neural headphones I spotted at CES 2024, all with very different designs.\n1. Naqi Neural Earbuds\nBrain implants sound like the stuff of science fiction but there are plenty of companies working on developing this tech for the consumer market. In this case, it's a company called Naqi Logix, which was co-founded by Dave Segal four years ago in Canada.\nSegal tells me that the reason he invented wearable tech that could use electric signals from the brain to control various devices, from smart home electronics to even flight simulators, was inspired by a wish to help a friend who had become quadriplegic.\n\"We build the only neural earbuds on planet Earth that can serve as a safe, non-invasive alternative to brain implants. [They offer] the ability to have a full command of control over Windows and Mac computers, including typing, browsing, shopping and playing contemporary video games,\" Segal explains.\nThe idea behind the earbuds, which use gyroscopic, muscle and brainwave sensors, is that the computer interface tech inside them could be used in any of the best wireless earbuds to give them this added control. Given its ability to completely transform lives, it's no wonder why the Naqi Neural Earbuds was a CES Innovation Award honoree for accessibility and aging tech.\n2. NeurGear ZenBud\nInstead of sensing nerves and translating those signals to control a device like the Neural Earbuds above, NeurGear's ZenBud headset uses ultrasonic sound waves to relax you. The tech works by stimulating what's called the Vagus nerve, which is responsible for various bodily functions such as digestion, heart rate and breathing.\nJohn Hacker, the founder and CEO of NearGear, explained to me that by stimulating a person's Vagus nerve, it triggers a rest response, which sends calming signals to the brain. This helps to \"strengthen your stress resilience and your ability to relax. By using it just five minutes for a week, you can see marked increases in stress resilience and relaxation\".\nWhile the ZenBud is still in its early stages \u2013 NeurGear was only founded in 2021 \u2013 ultrasound tech like this could be rolled out to the best earbuds in the future. But if you want to try it out sooner then, as part of NeurGear's Kickstarter campaign, you can pre-order it now for $1 and receive a $100 discount off the purchase price, which is not yet known.\n3. MyWaves Technologies Pebble\nPitched more as a headphone accessory, the myWaves Pebble device, which you can see in the picture above, attaches to your forehead to analyze your brain waves while sleeping to create custom music tracks that it claims will help you sleep.\n\"We have a science-backed technology that basically uses your delta waves, which are linked in your brain to sleep, to tell you all the activities of your sleep, from deep sleep to rapid eye movement (REM). By selecting a very specific part of your [delta waves while] sleep and turning it into music, we can produce music that triggers your brain to fall asleep quicker, longer and better,\" Jean Francois Destexhe, the CEO of myWaves Technologies, says.\nDestexhe assures me that this device isn't meant to be worn every night, though. Instead, the idea is that you wear it for one night to get the recording. You then upload it to myWaves' platform, which next transforms your \"brainwaves into lullabies to help you fall asleep faster\".\nYou can currently sign up for early access to the tech, which was originally invented by Alain Destexhe and Luc Foubert, who are researchers of the Paris-Saclay Institute of Neuroscience (NeuroPSI),\u00a0and receive a 40% discount off the price when it does become available.\n4. Earable Neuroscience Frenz Brainband\nAnother company focusing on finding a solution to falling and staying asleep is Earable Neuroscience, which has been running since 2018 with the help of the University of Colorado and University of Oxford. Like myWaves, it also tracks your brain's signals to create a custom music track that promises to help you sleep but it instead has a developed a physical headset that you can wear above your ears.\nThe headset itself uses the same tech as the best bone conduction headphones to play the music, which Kimi Doan, chief growth officer at the company, says is much less intrusive and more comfortable than placing an earbud directly in the ear while trying to sleep. She tells me that \"it tracks in real-time your brain activity signals and neuro feedbacks. Based on that, the AI will automatically personalize and select the digital therapeutics that are for your brain\".\nEarable Neuroscience currently has 18 patents in various stages of completion and is the winner of CES' Innovation Awards for 2024. It had also won the CES Awards for Wearables tech last year. If you want to be one of the first to try out its Frenz Brainband then you can pre-order it for $490, with it scheduled to be shipped by February 2024.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: I used this weird AI 'brainband' for a month, and it cured my insomnia\nWhen I first stumbled upon the Frenz Brainband AI sleep device at CES earlier this year, I was skeptical. Who wouldn't be? You're telling me this crown-like thingamajig can actually cure my insomnia \u2014 with AI and binaural beats?\nPfft, no way. Nope. I don't believe it.\nHowever, Earable Neuroscience (the team behind Frenz) sent me a unit for me to test ahead of its CES 2024 showcase. And to my surprise, after using the Brainband for a month, my doubts were quieted.\nHowever, there are still some flaws that need to be rectified before the product is truly ready for prime time.\nFrenz Brainband price\nThe Brainband costs $520 via Amazon.\nAlong with the funky-looking, avant-garde crown, it ships with a charging cable.\nAt first, I thought the device was overpriced. However, I must take into account that the Frenz Brainband is very new to the market, so it's trying to appeal to early adopters who don't mind experimenting with fledgling tech. In time, as it grows in popularity, the price should drop.\nSecond, in my experience, the device actually works, so the question is, would I drop over $500 on a device that promises to improve my sleep? Hell, yeah.\nIf a wearable can cost $800 and do nothing for my sleep but track it (I'm lookin' at you Apple Watch Ultra 2), the Frenz Brainband's price is actually quite reasonable.\nHow does the Frenz Brainband work?\nTo give you a little background about myself, I suffer from insomnia. There are times I can't seem to fall asleep until 7 a.m. My mind is simply too busy; it's running a million miles per minute, and I can't make it stop.\nI'm not new to sleep tech. For example, I've experimented with the Apollo Neuro, a wearable that, in part, claims to help lull you to sleep. In that review, I explained that it did absolutely nothing for me in terms of improving my slumber. I've tested smartwatches from Apple and Samsung. They track your sleep, but they're not designed to improve it.\nThe Frenz Brainband, on the other hand, does claim to enhance your sleep, ensuring that you knock out faster and deeper. And not only that, the Frenz Brainband promises to help you wake up refreshed \u2014 by using on-device machine-learning that offers personalized sleep and coaching programs. To put it succinctly, the Frenz Brainband relies on sensors to learn who you are and delivers science-backed audio and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) voice coaching that is customized for you.\nWhat I love about the Frenz Brainband\nThere are pros and cons to every product I review, so first, let's start with what I appreciate about the Frenz Brainband.\nSetup was easy\nYou must connect the Frenz Brainband to your phone via Bluetooth, which lets you interact with a companion app called \"FRENZ sleep.\"\nThe way that the companion app takes you through the setup process step-by-step is thoughtful \u2014 as if the Earable Neuroscience team anticipated every head-scratching thought that would plague n00bs during the onboarding journey.\nThere's a slideshow that walks you through how to wear the Brainband properly, how to connect it to your phone, how to turn off the band, and how binaural beats and voice coaching work in unison to deliver sleep magic.\nSensors detect seven different data points\nOne thing that shocked me about the Frenz Brainband is that it knows if I'm wearing it upside down. And get this \u2014 it can even detect whether you're sleeping on your back, your side, and other positions. How? It's got plenty of sensors that can detect the following:\nbrain signals\neye signals\nmuscle signals\nmotion detection\noxygen levels (spO2)\nheart rate\nbreathing/acoustic sounds\nIn collecting this data about you, the on-device machine-learning models determine which voice coaching and soothing audio to deliver to you before you sleep. The more you use it, the better it gets at \"understanding\" you.\nIf you're wondering about privacy, a Frenz rep assured me that all the data is stored locally, and the company does not have access to users' tracked information.\nIt actually works\nI was initially baffled by this AI-powered brainband, and my expectations were low. I thought, \"How is this going to work?\" On top of that, I thought that even if it did work for some, it wasn't meant for me, because I don't like to sleep with noise. I like complete and utter silence.\nHowever, I kept an open mind and gave it a go.\nThe tunes the AI selected for me sounded like meditation music \u2014 ethereal, soothing, and ambient. The voice coaching is reminiscent of any \"AI voice\" you'd hear in a sci-fi movie. It doesn't sound robotic, but \"Siri-esque,\" if that makes sense. Still, I thought, \"Come on; this won't help my insomnia!\" Soon after, I woke up in the morning \u2014 well-rested, mind you \u2014 and thought, \"What just happened?\"\nI sat up in my bed that morning, and at first, I thought something had gone wrong. I no longer heard music or voice coaching, but as it turns out, when the Brainband detects that you've fallen asleep, it ceases all sound. After falling asleep so quickly the first time I used it, I thought, \"This must be a fluke.\"\nHowever, I tried it again and again for a month, and each time I used it, I no longer laid on my back wondering when my mind would stop racing.\nIt's comfortable to wear (for me)\nWhen I saw the Frenz Brainband, which looks like something straight out of Star Trek, I thought, \"Would I feel comfortable wearing that?\" As it turns out, it's made out of a material called thermoplastic elastomer (TPE) that feels very soft, durable, and pliable \u2014 and it's hypoallergenic, too.\nKeep in mind that not everyone would agree. One of my coworkers tried it on and didn't find it pleasant to wear.\nIn-app activity tracking is awesome\nUnder the \"Insights\" tab in the companion app, you can get a wealth of information on your sleep:\nTotal sleep time\nSleep efficiency (measures your actual sleep time compared to your total time in bed)\nTime to fall asleep (the amount of time it takes you to fall asleep after getting into bed)\nBedtime routine (the time you tend to sleep during the week)\nWake up routine (the time you tend to wake up during the week)\nAverage heart rate (it should be between 60 and 100)\nBlood-oxygen level (it should be between 95% and 100%)\nIt even tells you which sleeping position is your obvious favorite. I seem to prefer sleeping on my back or sleeping on my left in a fetal position.\nWhat's \"eh\" about Frenz Brainband?\nThere are aspects about the Frenz Brainband that neither thrill me nor disappoint me; they're just there.\nIt uses bone conduction\nYou may be wondering, \"If the Brainband wraps around your forehead, how can you hear the audio that emanates from it?\" The AI sleep device uses bone conduction, which relies on the the user's skull to conduct sound to the ear, to get around this issue.\nIn order to hear the Brainband emanate \"full sound,\" there must be some pressure applied between the Brainband and your skull. This means it was difficult for me to hear sounds in certain positions, particularly while sleeping on my back. In this posture, most of the pressure is applied to the back of my head, where there isn't enough exposed skin for bone conduction to do its thing. Sleeping on my side, on the other hand, allowed me to hear the sounds in all their divine glory, thanks to my exposed temples.\nIt's worth noting, however, that according to a Frenz rep, you don't need to fully hear the voice coaching and ambient audio. Just hearing faint sounds from the voice coach and music should be enough to lull you to sleep.\nThe Smart Alarm feature is cool, but it can be a bother\nI'm sure you've experienced moments when you're suddenly awakened by your phone alarm \u2014 and it feels like your soul was electrocuted out of slumber. It's an awful feeling.\nWell, the Frenz Brainband has a feature that rectifies this issue. It's called \"Smart Alarm,\" and it's designed to make sure you wake up during the most optimal moment during your sleep stages, so you're refreshed and ready to go.\nI tried this feature, and it does, indeed, leave me feeling revitalized in the morning. My only gripe is that sometimes it will wake you up 10 minutes earlier than your target time. Still, I understand that sometimes that needs to be the case, because it's that moment that will bring you the most peaceful wakefulness.\nYou can't forget to charge it every night!\nConsidering that the Frenz Brainband is a relatively sleek device, the battery isn't half bad. It lasts about eight hours on a single charge. However, that means you have to remember to charge it every night before you go to bed.\nWhat I don't like about Frenz Brainband\nThere's plenty I love about the Frenz Brainband, but that doesn't mean it doesn't have flaws.\nI want a tighter fit\nThe Brainband wraps around my forehead with a clasp, but I wish it had some sort of mechanism to tighten the Brainband against my forehead for a more snug fit. This would help the sensors get a better read on my movements and sleep activity. At times, the Brainband shuts off the music and voice coaching prematurely, thinking I've fallen asleep, but I'm still awake.\nSuspicious hypnosis\nI don't love that the voice coach often starts off by telling users \u2014 somewhat hypnotically \u2014 that they should use Frenz AI continuously to get the best results.\nI understand this may be innocuous, but I can't help but get this nagging feeling that it's a subtle form of hypnosis.\nGood for iOS, but not Android\nWhen I tested the Frenz Brainband on my iPhone 15 Pro Max, it worked flawlessly. However, on Android, the companion app doesn't allow the AI to choose the audio and voice coaching on your behalf. It prompts the user to choose from a library for both categories, which takes away from the whole fun of a machine-learning model customizing an optimized sleep program for you.\nAccording to a Frenz rep, this is something they're working on.\nFinal thoughts\nI can't believe I'm saying this, but the Frenz Brainband does, indeed, help in lulling me to sleep.\nIt's difficult, however, to develop a habit of remembering to use it every night. On top of that, you have to make the effort to charge it every day, too. As such, the main challenge that Earable Neuroscience faces with the Frenz Brainband isn't the AI sleep device itself \u2014 it's consumer compliance. However, finding a way to increase battery life may help (if they ever come out with Frenz Brainband 2).\nTopics\nArtificial Intelligence\nGadgets\nMashable's tech editor reviewed this product by using it every night for at least four weeks. The setup process and user friendliness of the app were closely assessed, as was the comfortability and fit. Finally, we analyzed its effectiveness in promoting healthy sleep hygiene.\nKimberly Gedeon is a tech explorer who enjoys doing deep dives into the most popular gadgets, from the latest iPhones to the most immersive VR headsets. She's drawn to strange, avant-garde, bizarre tech, whether it's a 3D laptop, a gaming rig that can transform into a briefcase, or smart glasses that can capture video.

        "raw_content": "10 gadgets from CES 2024 that you can buy already\nThere are a lot of \"maybes\" and \"hope tos\" uttered at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), as many of the products demoed there take months or years to launch. And that's if they even make it to market at all; prototypes, previews, and proofs of concept are running themes at the annual tech convention in Las Vegas. But fortunately for anyone eager to get their hands on the latest gadgets, there are a few exceptions every year.\nBelow, we've rounded up a list of products from CES 2024 that are actually available for purchase or preorder immediately, including innovative wearables, stick-on TVs, and a physical manifestation of AI. Some of them blew us away, while others just weirded us out.\n1. Clicks Creator Keyboard Founders Edition\nThe Y2K revival rages on. Featuring a physical backlit keyboard that supports standard shortcuts (like CMD + A for \"Select All\"), this unibody case evoking the Sidekicks and Blackberries of yore is Clicks Technology's debut product. It's available in \"BumbleBee\" (yellow) and \"London Sky\" (gray) for the iPhone 14 Pro, 15 Pro, and 15 Pro Max.\n2. Garmin Lily 2\nGarmin's latest smartwatch is easily its most fashion-forward wearable to date, with a metal case and patterned lenses that act like stylish screensavers when the display is powered off. It comes with sleep monitoring and built-in sport apps, including a new dance fitness activity that can track different dance styles, and it lasts up to five days on a single charge. The standard Lily 2 comes in two colors with silicone bands, while the slightly pricier Lily 2 Classic (which adds support for Garmin Pay contactless payments) comes in four colors with nylon or leather bands.\n3. Apollo\nRead Mashable's full review of the Apollo.\nApollo Neuro says its new wellness wearable can improve your focus, help you sleep better, and ease your stress with the power of \"good vibes\" \u2014 i.e., by stimulating your vagus nerve (which regulates important bodily functions like heart rate and breathing). It didn't live up to all of those claims when Mashable tech editor Kim Gedeon tried it for three weeks ahead of CES, though it did have a positive effect on her social anxiety: \"It's similar to how I feel when I'm listening to binaural beats or ASMR,\" she wrote. At the time of publication, it was on sale for almost $70 off via Amazon and the Apollo Neuro website.\n4. EVOLVE MVMT\nEvolve MVMT's \"first-of-its-kind\" ankle wearable aims to make your gait more efficient and joint-friendly by tracking the quality (not quantity) of your steps \u2014\u00a0more specifically, the way your heel strikes the ground. If you're a flat-footed person who's \"ever had to pay for expensive orthotics or special footwear, which then has to be replaced every few years, this might be a solid alternative,\" wrote tech reporter Cecily Mauran.\n5. Nimble\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Nimble.\nIn one of the less dystopian examples of \"robots are taking over the world,\" the Nimble is a new 12-inch manicure robot that uses scanning technology and AI to do your nails in about half an hour. \"Since there was high demand to test out Nimble, I was only able to get one nail painted,\" Mauran reported from CES. \"But within minutes, I got polish and a topcoat, and my nail was fully dry. ... Nimble is precise and on par with the pros.\" Its polish capsules will be available in 30 colors, and new features \u2014 including pedicures \u2014 are supposedly in the works.\n6. Displace Flex and Displace Mini\nWatch Mashable staff try the Displace Mini.\nThey're not quite as exciting as LG's new transparent TV, but Displace's new lightweight, wireless 4K displays are still pretty cool in their own right (and certainly more practical): They have battery-powered suction that allows them to stick onto almost any wall or window \u2014 no mounting required. \"It's impossible to pull off unless you actually want to take it off,\" said tech reporter Matt Binder, who took part in a demo at CES. Both the 55-inch Flex model and the 27-inch Mini variant are expected to ship out in late 2024.\n7. Acer Swift Go 14\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Acer Swift Go 14.\nThe new Acer Swift Go 14 looks like a very average laptop until you pull up YouTube, which triggers a set of light-up media controls on its touchpad \u2014 a neat feature for those who use a PC as their primary entertainment device. (Support for other platforms like Twitch and Spotify are expected to be added at launch in March.) The base configuration is powered by a 13th-generation Intel Core i5 processor, but you can upgrade to a newer Intel Core Ultra 5 CPU.\n8. HP Spectre x360 14\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the HP Spectre x360 14.\nHP's newly refreshed convertible boasts next-gen specs (including an Intel Core Ultra processor with AI tools), a 14-inch OLED touchscreen, and a 9MP webcam. But the real star of the show is its clickety-clackety keyboard, which Gedeon called \"the best thing I've ever tested.\" \"I actually contemplated chucking my MacBook Pro out the window for that sweet, sweet typing experience on this irresistible HP laptop,\" she wrote.\n9. Wacom Cintiq Pro tablets\nAvailable in three sizes (17-, 22-, or 27-inch), Wacom's stunning and spacious new drawing slates were the best tablets Mashable saw at CES. Each one sports a vivid 4K display with a 120Hz refresh rate and customizable ExpressKeys for different settings and functions. They also come with the new Wacom Pro Pen 3, an ergonomic, pressure-sensitive stylus that \"allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning,\" Gedeon said post-demo.\n10. Wehead GPT Edition\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Wehead GPT Edition.\nThe Wehead puts a literal (emotionless, disembodied) face to OpenAI's large-language model GPT via two screens, and it's as creepy as it sounds. But in its defense, \"it gave some practical advice about surviving CES (stay hydrated, wear comfortable shoes) so there might be some redeemable qualities \u2014 if you're willing to spend $5,000,\" wrote Gedeon and Mauran. If you don't want to curse yourself to a lifetime with this thing, you've also got the option of renting it for $199 per month.\nHonorable mention: Skyted Mask\nAnother CES gadget that toed the fine line between \"wowing\" and \"weirding out,\" the Skyted Muzzle Mask has sound absorption technology that lets you make confidential voice calls when you're out in public. \"[We're] sure some people who are serious about their privacy may find it to be a must-buy for their lifestyle,\" said Gedeon and Mauran. \"However, we can\u2019t see ourselves using this product \u2013 it\u2019s just too outlandish for our tastes.\" Those who fall into the former category can save a serious chunk of cash by backing it on Kickstarter through early February.\nHonorable mention: Stern 'Jaws' pinball machine\nRead Mashable's hands-on review of the Stern JAWS pinball machine.\nStern's faithful pinball adaptation of the 1975 classic includes that awesome John Williams score, some new voiceover lines from Richard Dreyfuss, and a playfield filled with movie references that's \"immensely fun to look at,\" said tech and games reporter Alex Perry. Now, for the catch (of the day): It appears to be limited to commercial dealers and distributors, and it starts at a whopping $7,000; you can go all the way up to $13,000 for the limited-edition model with different cosmetics. Maybe just wait for it to show up at your local dive bar.\nTopics\nCES\nHaley Henschel is a Chicago-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable who reviews and finds deals on popular tech, from laptops to gaming consoles and VPNs.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 unveils 'Neural' tech headsets for stress-free experience and relaxation\nInnovations at CES 2024 unveiled 'neural' earbuds like NeurGear ZenBud and Naqi Neural Earbuds, using brainwave sensors for relaxation and control over devices, revolutionizing personal tech experiences.\n'Neural' tech headsets\nThe first headphones were crafted by engineer Nathaniel Baldwin at his kitchen table. With time, earphones transitioned from wired to wireless, and advancements brought us earbuds for an immersive sound experience.\nAt the recent Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024, new technologies for buds and headphones were showcased, focusing on 'neural' technologies.\nThese innovations aim to use neural sensors to measure brainwaves, helping users to focus, destress, and improve their mental well-being.\nNeural earbuds, a highlight at CES 2024, act as tools to read users' minds, enabling hands-free operation for tasks like playing, pausing, changing volume, and skipping songs.\nThey stimulate the vagus nerve, which plays a crucial role in controlling digestion, sweating, and mood.\nSome people with depression use a vagus nerve stimulator to alleviate symptoms over time.\nLet's explore some of the 'neural' earbuds introduced at CES 2024:\nNeurGear ZenBud\nAt CES 2024, NeurGear introduced its new product, 'NeurGear ZenBud' neural headphones.\nThese headphones use ultrasonic sound waves to help users relax.\nThe technology works by stimulating the Vagus nerve, which controls functions like digestion, heart rate, and breathing.\nThe Vagus nerve is a key part of the parasympathetic nervous system.\nAccording to the founder of NeurGear's ZenBud, stimulating the Vagus nerve triggers a rest response in the body, sending calming signals to the brain.\nThis in turn, strengthens stress resilience and the ability to relax.\nUsing the ZenBud for just five minutes a week can lead to noticeable improvements in stress resilience and relaxation, as per the founder John Hacker.\nNaqi Neural Earbuds\nCo-founded by Dave Segal in Canada four years ago under 'Naqi Logix,' these earbuds were presented at CES 2024.\nSegal highlighted their uniqueness, stating they serve as a safe, non-invasive alternative to brain implants.\nThe earbuds, equipped with gyroscopic, muscle, and brainwave sensors, offer full command and control over Windows and Mac computers.\nThis includes typing, browsing, shopping, and playing contemporary video games.\nOther 'neural' technology earbuds featured at CES 2024 include \u2018MyWaves Technologies Pebble\u2019 and \u2018Earable Neuroscience Frenz Brainband.\u2019\nThese innovations mark a significant step forward in the integration of technology with mental well-being and user convenience.\nAstro News\nNEWSLETTERS SIGNUP\nTop stories\nCopyright \u00a9 2024 - Odisha Television Limited All Rights Reserved."
