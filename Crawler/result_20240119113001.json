        "raw_content": "Sponsored Content\nby Wemeet Mobility\nWemeet Mobility Sparks Digital Revolution in Logistics, Spearheading Innovation and Collaborations at CES 2024\nIn today\u2019s hyper-competitive market, achieving precise last-mile delivery stands as a pivotal factor in the quest to provide unparalleled consumer experiences. As of September 2023, over 60% of European retailers have identified accuracy as a key priority, even above speed. To achieve higher accuracy, retailers must proactively manage and meet customer expectations, with strategic planning as the most effective approach.\nIn the rapidly evolving distribution and logistics industry, fast and labor-intensive delivery no longer guarantees profitability and customer satisfaction. Achieving sustainable economic success demands a fundamental rethink of traditional delivery models. Instead of absorbing shipping costs into product margins and relying solely on economies of scale for competitiveness, a more economically viable and competitive solution is imperative.\nNavigating the Trifecta: Precision, Customer-Centricity, and Sustainability in the Post-Epidemic Era\nEnter Wemeet Mobility, the herald of a new era in logistics. The award-winning Korean logistics IT startup presents its visionary Roouty solution for an IT-enabled transformation of the logistics sector. Roouty is a vehicle mobility solution that leverages Wemeet Mobility\u2019s proprietary route optimization engine and precision maps to redefine last-mile logistics. It enables multiple vehicles to traverse routes efficiently and provides real-time visibility into the drivers\u2019 transportation statuses, thereby allowing logistics companies to efficiently implement different policies.\nWhat sets Wemeet Mobility apart is the engine\u2019s swift computation speed and customizable logic tailored for diverse business purposes. Furthermore, the route planning\u2019s Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) boasts high accuracy, with just a \u00b110-minute deviation from the Actual Time of Arrival (ATA), significantly enhancing logistics efficiency.\nEffective communication plays a pivotal role in managing expectations, encompassing details such as the delivery time, location, and method, along with any modifications made during the delivery process. Yet, within the current logistics landscape, achieving seamless communication remains an arduous task. The on-time arrival rate languishes below 60%, especially in sectors like electronics stores, where only 50% provide a time frame plan, and clothing companies often stipulating two to three business days for delivery.\nHowever, the contemporary retail landscape demands more than just accuracy and speed from retailers to satisfy customers throughout the delivery process. Last-mile delivery, influencing overall customer satisfaction, necessitates thoughtful considerations for effectively managing and executing the reverse logistics process. Moreover, beyond customer satisfaction, there is mounting public pressure on the last-mile industry to prioritize sustainability. Thus, it becomes imperative for delivery services to adopt eco-friendly practices and transparently communicate the value and efforts invested in offsetting carbon emissions.\nRoouty: Revolutionizing Last-Mile Delivery to Meet Dynamic Customer Needs\nWemeet Mobility is at the forefront of innovation, currently collaborating with startups in Korea and Japan to pioneer new logistics-related services. Leveraging its advanced route optimization engine, the company has introduced a groundbreaking Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V) same-day delivery network on Jeju Island. This real-time dynamic routing service has received positive feedback from both tourists and residents, and the company plans to expand its offerings into a comprehensive logistics, transportation, and tourism concierge service. This collaborative effort involves partnering with multiple startups on Jeju Island, showcasing Wemeet Mobility\u2019s commitment to transforming communities, enhancing local routes, and ensuring efficient access to all areas.\n\u201cOur same-day delivery network service has the potential to transform communities by efficiently revitalizing local routes, providing access to traditionally underserved areas, and facilitating smoother tourism across the board,\u201d said Guisun-Kang, CEO of Wemeet Mobility, calling for collaboration from various companies and global organizations to build an ecosystem to realize this vision.\nCurrently, Wemeet Mobility is working with public logistics and distribution companies in Korea, spearheading initiatives to address and resolve various logistical challenges. These ongoing collaborations underscore Wemeet Mobility\u2019s commitment to fostering positive transformations within the logistics landscape and establishing itself as a trusted partner in driving impactful industry advancements.\nNavigating through intricate road conditions becomes less dependent on conventional systems, placing a heightened emphasis on the critical role of driver knowledge. However, the logistics industry faces a significant hurdle with a shortage of experienced drivers due to an aging workforce and job insecurity. This scarcity emphasizes the need for a human-centric approach in logistics, where personal know-how and intuition play pivotal roles.\nRelying solely on a statistical optimization approach poses challenges in gaining trust from end users and may hinder the development of a user-friendly product. Wemeet Mobility pursues a human-centric and efficient approach to transform the logistics field. The distinctive feature of their AI-powered technology lies in its development centered around this principle.\nWemeet Mobility Unveils the Future of Last-Mile Delivery and Services at CES 2024\nAt the upcoming Consumer Electronics Show (CES) from January 9\u201312, 2024, in Las Vegas, Wemeet mobility is set to make a significant impact at CES 2024 as it unveils its cutting-edge solution, Roouty, and shares its vision for the IT-enabled transformation of the logistics industry. During the event, the company plans to actively engage with attendees, collaborating with both public and private groups to explore strategies for success in the post-pandemic last-mile delivery landscape. The focus will extend beyond showcasing Roouty, as Wemeet Mobility aims for global expansion, targeting markets in the US, Japan, Singapore, and beyond.\nWemeet Mobility will discuss successful post-pandemic last-mile delivery strategies, with a comprehensive exploration of the essential skills required for their effective execution. As a trailblazer in the logistics industry, Wemeet Mobility has garnered attention and acclaim for its innovative approaches, seamlessly integrating both conventional and digital realms. The company\u2019s presence at CES promises to offer valuable insights into the future of logistics to attendees and participating public and private groups.\nHaving secured the top position in the 2022 Logistics Conference and the 2023 Korea Logistics Startup Competition, Wemeet Mobility will spotlight its commitment by emphasizing on upgrading logistics operations by implementing digital transformation in the convention.\nLearn more about the innovative solutions and future of logistics services in the digital age at Roouty\u2019s website or connect on Wemeet Mobility\u2019s LinkedIn page."

In a brand-new location, within Central Plaza (CP-25 and CP-26), Continental is showcasing advancements with its latest partnerships, award-winning displays and driving solutions aimed at making roadways safer. Visitors to the company\u2019s private exhibit will experience Continental\u2019s latest advancements in software-driven mobility. Additionally, Continental will demonstrate, along with several of its strategic partners, its vision for the future of mobility.\n\u201cWe are advancing technology solutions for the new era of mobility,\u201d said Aruna Anand, President and CEO, Continental Automotive, North America. \u201cContinental has an impact on almost every aspect of the vehicle. By leveraging our expertise in software-driven mobility, we are shaping the future of mobility. At CES 2024, we\u2019ll demonstrate how we\u2019re making mobility safer, exciting, and autonomous.\u201d\nBuilding a new space within the vehicle\nAs the car becomes an essential integrated space to interact with all aspects of personal and professional life, the user experience becomes a key factor for car buyers. Continental will demonstrate innovations that enable a novel and creative user experience.\nDuring CES 2024, exciting, intuitive, and award-winning user displays will be front and center for Continental. Showcased for the first time, the Crystal Center Display demonstrates the next generation of technology and highlights innovative design possibilities while matching the trend for luxury appearance. For a more subtle effect, the Curved In2visible Display integrates seamlessly into the cockpit enabling new design possibilities and turning a vehicle into a living room on wheels.\nAs vehicles integrate more software and take on functions like computers and smartphones, they must also become more secure. Continental has considered this with its Face Authentication Displays. These are the highest security standards for smooth car entry and safe vehicle start. The \u201cliveness check\u201d ensures only the driver, or those registered to the vehicle\u2019s profile, can secure access.\nIncreasing mobile computing power\nIn addition to becoming more automated, vehicle technology is increasingly more connected. Connected vehicles make driving safer and more convenient. To support such new functions, cars have become computers on wheels. Software-defined vehicles and connected mobility require more intelligence and computing power, but current vehicle architectures are reaching their limits. Continental\u2019s Smart Cockpit High-Performance Computer (HPC), in collaboration with Google Cloud, demonstrates how the Smart Cockpit HPC enables the mobility experience of the future. Together, the two companies are equipping cars with generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), making Continental one of the first automotive suppliers to integrate Google Cloud capabilities directly into vehicle computers. With this, drivers can interact with their car in a natural dialogue. Whether drivers need help finding the right tire pressure when the car is fully loaded or want to know more about local places of interest at their destination or along the route when they are on vacation, the generative AI can compile the required information and answer the drivers\u2019 questions.\nDeveloping the future of driverless transportation\nThe Radar Vision Parking solution, named a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree, enables Level 3 and Level 4 driving and parking functions of software-defined vehicles. By combining high-resolution surround radars with high-resolution cameras, Continental enables parking use cases that require very precise and close-range measurement around the vehicle. Early parking slot detection, for example, lets users park in a single stroke without driving past the spot.\nVisitors will also experience the power of partnerships with Aurora Innovation's autonomous technology. In this first-of-its-kind partnership, Continental is responsible for industrializing the autonomous driving system kits which will leverage a wide spectrum of Continental\u2019s extensive automotive product portfolio from sensors, automated driving control units (ADCU), high performance computers (HPC), telematics units and more, to the complete fallback system which covers the full chain of effects. Continental will integrate these hardware components into pods which will be supplied to Aurora\u2019s vehicle manufacturing partners. This will advance the product offering for autonomous trucking customers.\nAlso on display will be the Full Stack Automated Driving Solution with Ambarella. Continental contributes the hardware and large parts of the software to this partnership, while Ambarella provides the System-on-Chip (SoC) platform and further software functionalities. Compared to other domain controller SoCs, Ambarella\u2019s \u201cCV3-AD\u201d chip family provides higher performance to process sensor data faster and more comprehensively for greater environmental perception and safer mobility, at up to five times higher power efficiency. As a result of this strategic partnership, the next generation of vehicles, ranging from L2+ to the highest automation levels, will be able to utilize the powerful, energy-efficient, and scalable mobility system solutions from Continental and Ambarella.\nContinental at CES 2024\nContinental will showcase its latest technologies at a private structure exhibit in Central Plaza across from the Las Vegas Convention Center from Tuesday, January 9 through Friday, January 12. The technology company has numerous solutions that highlight mobility innovations, from the road to the cloud. An invitation-only media event has been scheduled for January 9.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Continental will demonstrate innovations that enable a novel and creative user experience.\nDuring CES 2024, exciting, intuitive, and award-winning user displays will be front and center for Continental. Showcased for the first time, the Crystal Center Display demonstrates the next generation of technology and highlights innovative design possibilities while matching the trend for luxury appearance. For a more subtle effect, the Curved In2visible Display integrates seamlessly into the cockpit enabling new design possibilities and turning a vehicle into a living room on wheels.\nAs vehicles integrate more software and take on functions like computers and smartphones, they must also become more secure. Continental has considered this with its Face Authentication Displays. These are the highest security standards for smooth car entry and safe vehicle start. The \u00e2\u20ac\u0153liveness check\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd ensures only the driver, or those registered to the vehicle\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s profile, can secure access.\nIncreasing mobile computing power\nIn addition to becoming more automated, vehicle technology is increasingly more connected. Connected vehicles make driving safer and more convenient. To support such new functions, cars have become computers on wheels. Software-defined vehicles and connected mobility require more intelligence and computing power, but current vehicle architectures are reaching their limits. Continental\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Smart Cockpit High-Performance Computer (HPC), in collaboration with Google Cloud, demonstrates how the Smart Cockpit HPC enables the mobility experience of the future. Together, the two companies are equipping cars with generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), making Continental one of the first automotive suppliers to integrate Google Cloud capabilities directly into vehicle computers. With this, drivers can interact with their car in a natural dialogue. Whether drivers need help finding the right tire pressure when the car is fully loaded or want to know more about local places of interest at their destination or along the route when they are on vacation, the generative AI can compile the required information and answer the drivers\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 questions.\nDeveloping the future of driverless transportation\nThe Radar Vision Parking solution, named a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree, enables Level 3 and Level 4 driving and parking functions of software-defined vehicles. By combining high-resolution surround radars with high-resolution cameras, Continental enables parking use cases that require very precise and close-range measurement around the vehicle. Early parking slot detection, for example, lets users park in a single stroke without driving past the spot.\nVisitors will also experience the power of partnerships with Aurora Innovation's autonomous technology. In this first-of-its-kind partnership, Continental is responsible for industrializing the autonomous driving system kits which will leverage a wide spectrum of Continental\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s extensive automotive product portfolio from sensors, automated driving control units (ADCU), high performance computers (HPC), telematics units and more, to the complete fallback system which covers the full chain of effects. Continental will integrate these hardware components into pods which will be supplied to Aurora\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vehicle manufacturing partners. This will advance the product offering for autonomous trucking customers.\nAlso on display will be the Full Stack Automated Driving Solution with Ambarella. Continental contributes the hardware and large parts of the software to this partnership, while Ambarella provides the System-on-Chip (SoC) platform and further software functionalities. Compared to other domain controller SoCs, Ambarella\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s \u00e2\u20ac\u0153CV3-AD\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd chip family provides higher performance to process sensor data faster and more comprehensively for greater environmental perception and safer mobility, at up to five times higher power efficiency. As a result of this strategic partnership, the next generation of vehicles, ranging from L2+ to the highest automation levels, will be able to utilize the powerful, energy-efficient, and scalable mobility system solutions from Continental and Ambarella.\nContinental at CES 2024\nContinental will showcase its latest technologies at a private structure exhibit in Central Plaza across from the Las Vegas Convention Center from Tuesday, January 9 through Friday, January 12. The technology company has numerous solutions that highlight mobility innovations, from the road to the cloud. An invitation-only media event has been scheduled for January 9.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: The Show\u2019s Growing Influence on Automotive & Mobility\nWhy are we excited about CES this year?\nCES 2024, formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show, runs January 9-12 in Las Vegas.\nCES is a big show. The 2020 show, which ran just prior to the Covid shutdown, hosted 171,000 attendees. Attendance figures dwindled in subsequent years, but 2023 found the show hitting a respectable 115,000.\nThis year, CES expects to host approximately 130,000 attendees and 4,000 exhibitors, which includes more than 300 mobility-related companies.\nUnlike smaller conventions in Las Vegas, CES fills all of the halls at the Las Vegas Convention Center plus overflows across 10 hotels. So, planning ahead is important if you\u2019re going to prioritize the booths you want to visit.\nA big part of CES\u2019s evolution over the past few years has been its evolution into a major\u00a0automotive show. This makes a lot of sense, given how technology is increasingly\u00a0interwoven into the automotive industry.\nAutomakers typically take the opportunity for a sizable presence at CES, but this year shows a more muted footprint by the large car companies. Ford, General Motors, Stellantis and Toyota are not formally participating.\nWhile sad, the lack of some of the larger automakers leaves much more opportunity for the remainder to stand out.\nThe new West Hall is where the big automotive players exhibit.The theme in this hall is \u201cVehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility\u201d \u2013 where you\u2019ll see the big vendor displays from Hyundai, Kia, VinFast, John Deere, Caterpillar, Magna and Amazon Automotive.\nHonda intends to debut an all-new global electric-vehicle series and showcase key technologies. The company said it will introduce 30 new EVs by 2030, a number that includes both battery-electric and fuel-cell-powered products.\nSeparately,\u00a0Afeela, the brand created by a Sony-Honda joint venture, will exhibit its latest vehicle prototype.\nThe map of the Convention Center\u2019s West Hall reveals that Hyundai has the largest footprint. The company plans to share developments related to hydrogen fuel cells and software-defined vehicle technology.\nIn addition, Hyundai\u2019s Supernal subsidiary\u00a0will unveil a product concept for its eVTOL aircraft and show its associated vertiport.\nVietnamese automaker\u00a0VinFast, who recently announced they expect to have 125 franchised dealers as part of an initial rollout and then hundreds by the end of 2024 throughout the U.S., will present two vehicles at CES that could be coming to\u00a0U.S. dealerships\u00a0within a couple of years: an electric pickup and the VF 3 microcar that could sell for under $20,000.\nElectric vehicle and charging news made a splash at the 2023 CES tech show. But their presence this year mirrors what's going on in the automotive market \u2014 a bit of an EV growth slowdown. At the 2024 CES, EV announcements are much more subdued than at last year\u2019s show.\nBlink Charging plans to exhibit. Additional major charging companies such as EVgo, ChargePoint and Electrify America say they won't exhibit or break news at the show.\nLooking over the exhibit hall space, Autonomous (self-driving) technology no longer seems to be an auto industry obsession. Problems at\u00a0GM subsidiary Cruise\u00a0highlighted a troublesome 2023 for robo taxis in particular. Ford\u00a0announced last year\u00a0that it would move away from fully autonomous tech. Both Ford and GM took huge losses on automated tech last year. Unlike previous CES expos, few self-driving demonstrations are expected.\nHaving said that, a number of companies will show off how using AI inside vehicles is making them smoother and safer for drivers through better in-vehicle virtual assistants and cabin monitors.\nBeyond the automakers, Tier 1 automotive suppliers use CES to showcase cutting-edge technologies. Expect to see new offerings from companies such as Qualcomm, Mobileye, Bosch, Magna and others.\nI expect that this year, on the back of their announcement with Hyundai, the Amazon Automotive booth will be quite busy.\nThe North Hall hosts a number of smaller vendors in the Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility theme and is worth checking out.\nBut, by no means are the automotive and mobility innovations limited to just these locations. For example, last year, we got a glimpse of the brand-new Honda-Sony JV vehicle named the Afeela in the Central Hall.\nIn recent years, CES has become much more focused on startups. I believe that the earlier-stage companies in the smaller booths at the Venetian Expo make up the best part of the show. The Venetian Expo hosts a number of interesting sections, including the \u201cInnovations Showcase\u201d and \u201cCountry Pavilions.\u201d\nFinally, I will be up on stage twice on Monday this week, both at the Connected2Car Conference. I will kick off the conference with a keynote on the state of vehicle electrification, and then I\u2019ll moderate a panel on the evolution of the dealership sales channel, with panelists Mike Stanton (NADA), Jeremy Beaver (DGDG), Beth Hill (Ford Direct) and Jessica Stafford (Cox Automotive).\nCES is the premier conference for new technologies and has become a major conference for breaking news in the automotive and mobility industries.\nI look forward to seeing you out there!\nGeneral Partner at Automotive Ventures | Author of the book \"The Future of Automotive Retail\" | Author of the weekly \"Intel Report\"\nRelated posts\n2024 Predictions\n2023 Predictions:\nHow Did We Do?\nFunding the next wave of innovation in transportation technology\nCopyright \u00a9 Automotive Ventures"
