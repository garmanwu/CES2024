        "raw_content": "Global Ecommerce Trends 2024\nAs we dive into 2024, the world of ecommerce is set for exciting and transformative changes. With technology and consumer preferences evolving at a rapid pace, online shopping is becoming more convenient, personalized, and sustainable than ever before.\nIn this blog post, we will explore the key global ecommerce trends that are reshaping the digital retail landscape. From the rise of social commerce and augmented reality shopping experiences to the increasing importance of sustainability in consumer choices, 2024 promises to be a year of innovation and opportunity for both businesses and shoppers. Let's take a closer look at the e-commerce trends in the global market now!\nTable of Contents\nAccelerated Use of Mobile Shopping\nOne of the trends in ecommerce that's rapidly gaining momentum in 2024 is the accelerated use of mobile shopping. With the ubiquitous presence of smartphones, consumers are increasingly turning to their mobile devices for making purchases. This shift is driven by convenience, as mobile apps and responsive websites provide seamless and user-friendly shopping experiences, allowing customers to acquire the products they desire with a few taps on their phones. In response to ecommerce industry trends like this, businesses are optimizing their platforms for mobile, enhancing the checkout process, and implementing innovative features to cater to the ever-growing mobile-savvy audience.\nSocial Commerce Continues to Grow and Evolve\nSocial commerce, the amalgamation of social media and online shopping, has evolved into an ecommerce force to be reckoned with in 2024. With features like in-app shopping, live-streamed product showcases, and influencer partnerships, social platforms are becoming veritable marketplaces. Consumers trust the recommendations of friends and influencers, making social commerce a powerful channel for brand discovery and shopping. To sum up, the integration of social elements into the shopping experience is changing the way we explore, choose, and buy products online.\nPersonalization Is a Preferred Shopping Experience\nAs consumers are inundated with choices, shoppers no longer wish to sift through page after page of products. Instead, they seek tailored recommendations that align with their preferences and needs. This is how personalization has emerged as a new trend. In 2024, ecommerce platforms are leveraging AI and big data to curate personalized product suggestions, optimizing the user journey. From personalized product recommendations to customized marketing messages, the shopping experience is becoming increasingly individualized, enhancing customer satisfaction and fostering brand loyalty as well.\nArtificial Intelligence Will Help Brands Learn More About Shoppers\nIn the realm of ecommerce, data is gold, and artificial intelligence (AI) is the master key to unlocking its potential. In 2024, AI's role in online shopping is evolving to new heights. Brands are increasingly utilizing AI to gain insights into consumer behavior. From analyzing browsing patterns to predicting purchasing decisions, AI is allowing businesses to understand their customers on a more profound level. This knowledge not only facilitates more personalized shopping experiences but also aids in creating effective marketing strategies that resonate with individual preferences.\nZero-Party Data and Privacy Are on Consumers\u2019 Minds\nOn the other hand, privacy and data security are paramount concerns for today's consumers. The growing awareness of data breaches and personal information misuse has led to a significant shift in how brands collect and handle customer data. In 2024, we see a surge in the use of zero-party data, where consumers willingly and consciously share information with brands in exchange for personalized experiences. Striking the right balance between personalization and privacy will be a challenge that forward-thinking companies are keen to address, ensuring that consumers feel both valued and secure in their online interactions.\nAR and VR Enhance Online Shopping Experiences\nAugmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) have transcended the boundaries of science fiction and are now essential components of the future of online retail. In 2024, AR and VR technologies are enhancing online shopping experiences, allowing customers to interact with products in immersive ways. Whether it's virtually trying on clothing, visualizing furniture in a living space, or exploring a destination before booking a trip, these technologies bridge the gap between the physical and digital worlds.\nA Rise in Voice Search\nIn 2024, the way we search for products online is undergoing a fundamental shift as voice search gains prominence. Since smart speakers and voice inputs are everywhere, customers are increasingly using voice search methods to make queries on websites. This transformation in search behavior presents both opportunities and challenges for businesses. For example, to remain competitive, ecommerce companies are adapting their content and SEO strategies to cater to voice queries. Thus, understanding the nuances of conversational language and tailoring product information for voice search will be key in reaching and engaging with the tech-savvy, voice-activated consumer.\nBusinesses Focus On Optimizing for Conversion\nConversion optimization is taking center stage in the ecommerce arena of 2024. Beyond driving traffic to their websites, businesses are keenly focused on converting visitors into paying customers. To achieve this goal, business companies take measures like streamlining the user experience, simplifying the checkout process, and leveraging data analytics to boost the conversion rate. Once the conversion rate goes up, so do sales and ROI. Thus, in a competitive marketplace, optimizing for conversion is a strategic move that can significantly impact the bottom line.\nSubscriptions Help Retain Loyal Customers\nIn the quest for customer loyalty, subscription models are an ingenious solution. Whether it's for products, services, or content, subscriptions provide a steady stream of revenue and help retain a dedicated customer base. By offering convenience, cost savings, and exclusive perks, businesses can create a sense of belonging and continuous value for subscribers. In 2024, more brands are embracing subscription models as a means to foster lasting relationships with customers, creating a win-win situation where customers enjoy ongoing benefits, and businesses secure a predictable revenue stream.\nConsumers Are Choosing Brands That Align With Their Beliefs\nIn 2024, consumers are becoming more discerning in their brand choices. One salient trend is that they are placing a strong emphasis on values and beliefs aside from product quality alone. In other words, they are not merely seeking products, but also looking for brands that resonate with their personal ethos. This shift in consumer behavior has led to a surge in brand activism and corporate social responsibility, with brands that authentically align with social, environmental, or ethical causes finding favor with consumers. As a result, companies are investing more in purpose-driven marketing, aiming to not only sell products but also make a positive impact on the world.\nConsumers Are Increasingly Mindful of Sustainable E-commerce\nSustainability has moved from being a buzzword to a core aspect of ecommerce in 2024. With growing awareness of environmental issues, consumers are leaning more toward sustainability when shopping online. They prioritize brands that minimize their carbon footprint, reduce waste, and source ethically. By virtue of this, sustainable packaging, eco-friendly materials, and carbon-neutral shipping are gradually becoming industry standards. As a result, businesses are paying more attention to the eco-friendliness throughout their production processes.\nVideo Content and Livestream Shopping\nThere is no doubt that video is dominating the online shopping experience in 2024. Whether it's product demonstrations, reviews, or live shopping events, video content is a powerful tool for engaging and converting customers. Livestream shopping, in particular, has gained traction as it provides an interactive and real-time way for consumers to explore products and make purchases. It offers a sense of community and personal connection in the digital world, mirroring the in-store shopping experience. Given this, brands are investing in high-quality video production and live-streaming technology to create compelling, immersive shopping experiences.\nOmnichannel Selling via Marketplaces\nIn 2024, omnichannel retailing will continue to be a dominant force in the ecommerce industry. However, one of the emerging online shopping trends is the increased reliance on online marketplaces as a key component of the omnichannel strategy. Businesses are recognizing the immense potential of platforms like Alibaba.com and others as powerful sales channels to reach a broader customer base. By integrating these marketplaces into their overall sales strategy, brands can expand their reach, tap into the massive customer base of these platforms, and offer a consistent shopping experience across multiple channels.\nFinding the Balance between Planning and Flexibility\nThe last trend on our list is about striking the right balance between planning and flexibility. With the rapid evolution of ecommerce growth trends and technology, businesses must be agile and adaptable. This means they should not only be planned with meticulous care but also be able to adapt to sudden changes in the market environment or customer behavior. This is why ecommerce companies are not only investing in technology, data analytics, and supply chain management that enables them to optimize operations but also embracing a culture of flexibility to address unforeseen challenges, such as disruptions in supply chains or shifts in consumer preferences.\nConclusion\nIn the dynamic landscape of ecommerce in 2024, change is the only constant. The trends in e commerce we've explored, from the increasing weight of mobile shopping to the growing consciousness of sustainability, underscore the evolving preferences of consumers. To carve a path to success and thrive in the arena of ecommerce, it is essential to be fully aware of these trends in online shopping and adapt your business strategies accordingly. By embracing the current ecommerce trends and tapping into them, you are well-positioned to stay ahead of the curve and capitalize on the ever-expanding digital marketplace.\nSell on Alibaba.com\nIn today's global economy, the rise of e-commerce has revolutionized the way businesses operate and connect with customers. With the increasing demand for online shopping, it has become essential for businesses to establish a strong online presence in order to remain competitive. Alibaba.com, one of the world's largest e-commerce platforms, has emerged as a key player in the global marketplace, offering numerous advantages for businesses looking to expand their reach and increase their sales.\nOne of the most significant advantages of selling on Alibaba.com is the platform's vast global reach.

By selling on Alibaba.com, businesses can reach customers in countries and regions that may have been previously inaccessible, thus opening up new avenues for sales and revenue.\nFor merchants, Alibaba.com offers a range of tools and resources to help businesses set up their online storefronts, manage their inventory, and process orders efficiently.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"With advances in AI, we are ushering in the next generation of sourcing and empowering small businesses to succeed with our Smart Assistant at their side,\" Chris Lu, general manager at Alibaba.com North America, said in a statement last week.\nThe Alibaba.com booth features the e-commerce platform's artificial intelligence-powered Smart Assistant, designed to help users navigate the sourcing website, at the CES trade show in Las Vegas on January 12, 2024.

Photo: Matt Haldane>\nAlibaba.com's debut of Smart Assistant showed how ubiquitous AI innovation was at CES this year. No tech giant's exhibition was complete without showing off its effort in that space.\nBy putting generative AI at the centre of its exhibition, Alibaba.com made it clear where it thought the platform's advantage lies, despite some grumblings from a marketing manager that the product was not quite yet ready for prime time, according to a brand ambassador at the booth.\nA number of CES attendees at the Alibaba.com presentation were made up of select \"gold suppliers\", or those that pay for a premium membership on the platform, according to some exhibitors.\nA test of Smart Assistant by the Post showed the all-too-common limitations of new LLM-powered chatbots. When asked about the best options for sourcing a 10,000-milliampere-hour power bank, it offered a link to search results for the product on Alibaba.com. A follow-up query on the best way to determine differences in quality among suppliers resulted in a generic response about checking certifications and standards.\nAn online influencer is seen at the TikTok Shop booth preparing for a live-streaming session to sell goods directly from CES inside the Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas on January 10, 2024. Photo: Matt Haldane alt=An online influencer is seen at the TikTok Shop booth preparing for a live-streaming session to sell goods directly from CES inside the Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas on January 10, 2024. Photo: Matt Haldane>\nByteDance-owned TikTok, already famous for its more traditional recommendation algorithms that have made its short video service so difficult to put down, went in a different direction at CES. Its TikTok Shop booth inside the Aria Resort & Casino in Las Vegas, was set up with a live-streaming area where some influencers were invited to sell their wares directly from the trade show.\nWhile TikTok remains best known outside China as a platform to consume bite-sized videos, live-streaming e-commerce is already big business for the app's Chinese version, Douyin. E-commerce is seen by Beijing-based parent ByteDance as an important area for future growth.\nTikTok Shop representatives were roaming the CES floor looking for companies they can convince to sell on the platform. That task may have been harder for the US team. A US-based TikTok Shop employee told Shenzhen-based mechanical keyboard maker Keychron that he was not allowed to sign up Chinese companies. Only their team in mainland China can on-board those suppliers.\nConnections with mainland Chinese suppliers are seen as the secret weapon for new e-commerce entrants like Shein and PDD Holdings' Temu. These platforms are taking on Amazon.com on its home turf with dirt-cheap products, which are sold as they roll off the factory floor from their mainland suppliers.\n\"Temu or Shein can get those very low-cost items and low-cost shipping because they have the volume,\" said Stanley Wong, co-founder and chief product officer of Hong Kong-based Spaceship, which exhibited at CES under its Taiwanese entity. \"They have very professional teams to do that kind of supply chain management.\"\nTikTok Shop is also seeking to take on Shein and Temu. TikTok sees international e-commerce expansion so important to its future that it bought a 75 per cent stake in Indonesia's largest online shopping platform, enabling the firm restart its local operations which had earlier been suspended by regulators in Southeast Asia's largest economy.\nChinese suppliers are also Alibaba.com's bread and butter. While it is ostensibly a global sourcing platform, the vast majority of companies on Alibaba.com are Chinese, which typically offer big cost advantages owing to the mainland's vast manufacturing supply chain.\nEven start-ups are trying to use AI to help companies navigate the changing landscape of e-commerce in the West. Spaceship, for example, uses AI to help brands manage their own shops with Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify to determine the best logistics options for goods manufactured in China.\n\"Our focus is to enable individual sellers to\" achieve cost-effective supply chain management like Shein and Temu, Spaceship's Wong said.\nAs more merchants try to control their own brands and reduce the money they lose to platforms like Shein, Temu and TikTok Shop by operating their own sites, services like Spaceship make sense when making price comparisons on logistics solutions.\nStill, Spaceship does not have its own generative AI product yet to take on the likes of Alibaba. The company said it is considering one for customer service.\nMany of the underpinnings of AI LLMs are open-source code, making the technology easily accessible to start-ups even if they do not have the data advantage of tech giants. But it could be some time before the kinks are worked out and these start-ups can handle more sophisticated requirements of business users.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "raw_content": "Community\nTop 5 E-Commerce Trends To Watch In 2024\nE-commerce is constantly evolving to keep pace with the changing demands of consumers.\nIn 2024, as shoppers increasingly lean on artificial intelligence to answer questions and refine their searches, they will expect merchants, brands and marketplaces to keep pace.\nGenerative AI features deployed last year, such as chatbots and content-creation tools, will gain traction among users and merchants \u2014 and we\u2019re just getting started \u2014 as yet unimaginable use cases will be rolled out in the years to come.\n\u201cThe technology is nowhere near reaching its full potential; when it does, the disruptions are going to be massive,\u201d said James Yang, a partner at Bain & Co, a consultancy.\nWe canvased Alibaba Group\u2019s businesses, marketplaces and sector experts for their thoughts on consumer trends set to shape the industry in 2024 and how AI can help meet demand.\n\u201cAI\u2019s footprint will continue to expand, fostering an increasingly barrier-free and streamlined global commerce experience that benefits businesses of all sizes,\u201d said Kaifu Zhang, Vice President of Alibaba International, who leads the company\u2019s AI initiatives.\nCheck out the top e-commerce trends in descending order below.\nConsumers need light relief after several turbulent years, so they will bond with brands that inject fun into shopping.\nA backlash against boring helps explain why interactive and joyful retail formats were wildly popular in 2023. Livestreaming e-commerce and short-form videos straight to shoppers\u2019 cell phones spring to mind.\n\u201cThe TV is no longer the center of the living room in China, it\u2019s been replaced by the mobile,\u201d said Daniel Zipser, who leads consumer and retail efforts in Asia at McKinsey, a consultancy.\nZipser sees China as a hotbed of retail innovation and a leader in marrying livestreaming with commerce. He paid close attention to livestreaming developments during China\u2019s 11.11 shopping festival, the world\u2019s largest shopping campaign that runs from late October to mid-November. This is when merchants pour money into marketing campaigns and adopt the latest innovations in commerce.\nHe spotted the spread of a richer and more varied tapestry of livestreamers.\nOn China\u2019s largest digital marketplace, Taobao, 89 livestreaming e-commerce channels generated over RMB100 million ($14.1 million) in GMV each during 11.11, also known as Single\u2019s Day.\nLivestreamers can be influencers, celebrity anchors, or even avatars. One fast-developing trend to watch in 2024 is merchants creating their own livestreaming channels rather than relying on a third party to connect with clients. Taobao said 64 merchant-run livestreaming channels recorded turnover above RMB10 million, and 675 made sales of over RMB10 million during 11.11.\nLivestreaming platform Taobao Live told Alizila it will add to its stable of top-tier streamers in 2024, attracting KOLs with audiences in vertical consumer segments and niche categories. To do this, it is sharpening its conversion rate, creating a more engaging consumer experience and a richer product pool, leveraging AI to do so.\n\u201cWe expect livestreaming e-commerce and high-quality content will continue to be popular among consumers in 2024,\u201d a spokesperson for Taobao Live told Alizila.\nWe have witnessed the power of innovative activities such as pop-ups, concerts and livestreams\u2013 Gary Topp\nEUROPEAN COMMERCIAL DIRECTOR, ALIEXPRESS\nConsultants see the livestreaming e-commerce trend in China spreading worldwide.\nOne conduit is the marketplace AliExpress, which took livestreaming to another level by recently introducing a digital avatar to host a 24-hour non-stop livestream in some markets.\nLivestreaming is also helping knit online and offline shopertainment together into a seamless experience for shoppers. In a high-profile example, AliExpress organized a concert on Nov. 10 in Madrid, with performers including Henry Mendez and Funzo & Baby Loud, livestreaming it exclusively on its digital marketplace.\n\u201cIn the ever-evolving consumer market, we have witnessed the power of innovative activities such as pop-ups, concerts and livestreams in enhancing the overall consumer experience,\u201d said Gary Topp, AliExpress\u2019 European commercial director.\nGamification\nGamification is also gathering momentum as a way of engaging and entertaining shoppers.\nAs consumers worldwide tightened their purse strings, a touch of tinsel helped lighten the mood. Alizila has spotted examples in 2023 of treasure hunting and brands quickly rotating goods, so consumers always have something to discover.\n\u201cTimes are a bit tougher today; perhaps the sky\u2019s not as blue. But consumers don\u2019t want to feel like they have to save money; that\u2019s where delighting them is important both online and offline,\u201d said Bain\u2019s Yang.\nAliExpress invited consumers in eligible markets to participate in draws and games to win promotion codes and products during 11.11. In Korea, the marketplace and its brand ambassador, South Korean\u2013American actor Ma Dong-seok also known as Don Lee, launched a blind-box campaign, where the contents were a surprise. Shoppers could purchase one of the 80,000 blind boxes, collectively worth KRW1.1 billion ($852 million).\n\u201cAt AliExpress, we prioritize fostering connections with our customers and gaining insights into their needs and aspirations through diverse engagement initiatives. This helps us stay ahead of market trends and foster a vibrant shopping experience that is in tune with our customers\u2019 preferences,\u201d said AliExpress\u2019s Topp.\nEconomic uncertainty and the rising cost of living dented consumer confidence in 2023. As a result, saving money is a high priority, and shoppers will look for novel ways to stretch their household budgets in 2024, said Euromonitor International.\nValue hackers will try to cut expenditure without compromising on quality, and they\u2019re finding crafty ways to do it, the consultancy said.\nThese consumers actively seek cheaper options, pay with credit cards or rewards points, switch to premium private-label brands and participate in free activities. Deinfluencers have also become popular on social media this year, where KOLs expose products they believe are overpriced.\nIn China, the psychological impact of a slower-than-expected recovery from the pandemic is still widely felt, and consumers displayed value-seeking behavior writ large during the 11.11 shopping festival.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not a one-time tightening of the purse strings,\u201d said Bain\u2019s Yang, who believes this value-seeking behavior will continue for at least the next one to two years.\nOn the consumer-to-consumer marketplace Taobao, shoppers placed 210 million orders on a direct discount venue offering a 15% price reduction during 11.11, while app\u2019s forum featuring value-for-money products from manufacturers generated nearly 90 million orders.\n\u201cPrice competitiveness is the strongest force at work for both branded goods and non-branded goods, said Alibaba Group\u2019s CEO Eddie Wu, who also took on the mantle of Taobao and Tmall Group\u2019s CEO in December.\nTo offer the best price possible to consumers, Wu plans to leverage the group\u2019s platform model to optimize product efficiency, enhance supply chain efficiency, and adopt price competitiveness as a core strategy across all product tiers in the coming years.\nTaobao and Tmall Group continued its value drive in December with a \u2018year-end good price\u2019 shopping campaign. Tmall Taobao World, which facilitates shopping on Taobao and Tmall for Chinese consumers outside mainland China, launched its year-end sales campaign in markets including Macao and Taiwan last month.\nA spokesperson for Taobao and Tmall Group told Alizila that its marketplaces will continue to improve their traffic distribution mechanisms in 2024, provide traffic support for merchants who are willing to provide consumers with good products at reasonable prices, reduce the cost of customer acquisition for merchants, and match good products and good prices with users more efficiently, \u201call the while continuing to improve Taobao\u2019s pricing power.\u201d\nWinning Playbook\nRetailers and brands are pivoting swiftly to cater to these bargain hunters.\nThe trick to sustainably offering quality products at great prices, say consultants, is re-engineering supply chains.\n\u201cThat\u2019s the Rubik\u2019s cube you have to solve to offer value for money, but it\u2019s also very, very difficult to do,\u201d said Bain\u2019s Yang.\nData and applications are often siloed across supply chains and retailers don\u2019t always have the budget to rip out legacy systems and replace them with an end-to-end solution. Generative AI can interact with structured and unstructured data, allowing users to interact with data end-to-end and ask simple questions such as: \u201cWhere is the excess inventory?\u201d\n\u201cGen AI presents a great opportunity to reduce waste in terms of cutting inventories as supply chains become more efficient. Liquidation of inventory is expensive,\u201d said Zipser.\nThis year, AliExpress has been rolling out a business model called AE Choice, which offers more supply chain services and a curated collection of products. In September, it began piloting a global five-day delivery service in Spain, collaborating with logistics company Cainiao.\n\u201cConsumers\u2019 preferences are influenced by key factors such as product ratings, pricing, popularity, availability and timely delivery. It\u2019s evident that affordability alone is not enough; product quality holds significant importance. To meet these demands, AliExpress has launched Choice,\u201d said AliExpress\u2019s Topp.\n\u201cThis initiative aligns with the growing trend of consumers seeking value-for-money options. Moving forward, our commitment lies in continuously enhancing our user experience, expanding our product selection, and providing the best value for money.\u201d\n2023 disappointed many China pundits who were optimistic about the world\u2019s second-largest economy rebounding swiftly from the pandemic. That optimism faded during the year as economic headwinds buffeted consumer sentiment.\nYet long-term structural trends continue to unfold, and China\u2019s economy is steadily becoming more consumption-driven.\nWhen Chinese policymakers recently convened in Beijing to discuss the year ahead, they emphasized steady economic growth in 2024 and said the long-term positive outlook had not changed. While 5% growth may not set pulses racing like the 7%-plus a decade ago, China\u2019s economy is far bigger now.\nMcKinsey sees the country\u2019s retail sector, encompassing both products and services, rising by 5% this year, with similar projections for the coming years. Given China\u2019s vast market size, this incremental growth would translate into an additional RMB10 trillion ($1.4 trillion) in retail sales in 2027.\nTo put $1.4 trillion in perspective, it would make China the single-largest retail growth market globally. Just the incremental growth would equal the combined retail sales of India, Indonesia, and South Korea today, according to McKinsey\u2019s analysis.\n\u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d said McKinsey\u2019s Zipser.\nSimulations by McKinsey showed that the number of upper-middle and high-income households may reach 200 million by 2025 and 260 by 2030. Continued urbanization and rising income levels will drive consumption growth sustainably in the medium to long term, it said as the number of high-income cities will hit 82 by 2025 and 93 by 2030.\nTechnological change is, of course, a growth stimulant. Globally, generative AI could generate value for the retail and consumer packaged goods industry by increasing productivity by 1.2 to 2% of annual revenues, or an additional $400 billion to $660 billion, McKinsey estimated.\n\u201cAs large language models become increasingly mature, AI can be leveraged to achieve goals in e-commerce, such as cost reduction, efficiency improvement, and optimization of the consumer experience,\u201d a Taobao and Tmall Group spokesperson told Alizila.\nMarket Access\nResearch boutique China Skinny pointed out that brands hunting for growth should take market accessibility into account. China\u2019s highly developed e-commerce market provides a platform to reach consumers nationwide, versus a hefty outlay in a brick-and-mortar boutique built in, say, downtown Shanghai.\nIllustrating the maturity of e-commerce in China, the state\u2019s post bureau said it had delivered over 140 billion parcels across China in the year up to November 2023, higher than India\u2019s 88.8 million parcels in 2022.\nShoppers feel their individual contributions to holding back climate change are limited, and they\u2019re tuning out messages that place the burden on their behavior, said Euromonitor International.\nInstead, they are throwing the burden back onto retailers to show they are green. More than three in four consumers would appreciate information on making environmentally friendly online purchases, a report commissioned by Alibaba Group showed earlier this year.\nAs a result, merchants and marketplaces are stepping up their efforts on green labeling and certification.\nAlibaba\u2019s B2C e-commerce platform Tmall launched eco-friendly product labels in 2022 to help consumers check the impact of their purchases. Meanwhile, Alibaba\u2019s Energy Expert leverages deep learning-based AI models to analyze the carbon footprint of products.\n\u201cWe see an increasing number of sustainably-minded companies embedding sustainability into their core business models and operations to reduce their environmental impact. They\u2019re tapping into data analytics to understand their businesses\u2019 carbon footprints and gain actionable insights needed to transform their operations and supply chain,\u201d said Energy Expert\u2019s general manager, Zhou Wenwen.\nMore companies are collaborating to turn supply chains green. Alibaba and China\u2019s largest instant noodle maker Master Kong worked with French utility Veolia to recycle Master Kong\u2019s plastic packaging into rPET pellets. The pellets were then used to produce goods for sale on Tmall Supermarket, a grocery platform.\n\u201cThey [Alibaba] are actually aligning the interest between stakeholders,\u201d said Herbert Yum, Euromonitor\u2019s APAC research manager.\nCircular Economy\nThe circular economy is also gaining traction, where markets incentivize consumers to reuse products, rather than scrapping them and then extracting fresh resources from the environment.\nIn China, the second-hand resale marketplace in China Xianyu is thriving, recording DAU up over 20% year-over-year in September, the latest data available. Xianyu, also known as Idle Fish, told Alizila that in the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023, its users\u2019 cumulative carbon reduction reached 3.14 million tons, and the average daily carbon reduction amount hit 8,600 tons.\nXianyu attributed progress in promoting a green lifestyle among consumers to its business model. The model, which it dubs SEED (Sustainability, Ecosystem, Encouragement and Digital) encourages recycling using digital technologies.\n\u201cIn the SEED model, the key is to make sure users understand carbon reduction and put it into action,\u201d Xianyu\u2019s President Ding Jian said.\nGenerative AI opened up a wealth of opportunities for merchants and brands to become more efficient and offer consumers a more tailored shopping experience in 2023.\nAs Franck le Moal, Group IT Director and CIO of LVMH, recently told Alizila: \u201cFor LVMH Maisons, having this strong intimacy and strong interaction with customers to invent a personalized experience is absolutely critical. We believe that technology is able to bring us this unique opportunity.\u201d\nIn 2024, consumers will keep testing generative AI\u2019s capabilities and they expect brands to do the same, said Euromonitor, a consultancy. The retail industry must embrace ongoing experimentation to stay one step ahead.\nTake chatbots as an example. The well-established software app designed to mimic human conversation is enjoying a renaissance as generative AI renders the way it communicates more natural.\n\u201cAI is taking chatbots to the next level,\u201d said McKinsey\u2019s Zipser.\nGenerative AI can create smarter virtual assistants that create a more personalized shopping journey. It can offer detailed product recommendations in various formats, including text and short videos.\nThis technology is particularly useful for consumers shopping online because there is such a smorgasbord of choices, versus in a brick-and-mortar store where a quick browse of the shelves takes in all the options on offer.\nA fine-tuned chatbot can save consumers time by honing in on the product they want at an acceptable price point.\nOn Taobao, the embedded generative AI app Wenwen \u2014 which means asking in Mandarin \u2014 clarifies shoppers\u2019 demands and helps consumers navigate discounts. Since its beta launch in September, over 10 million people have tried the tool, a Taobao and Tmall Group spokesperson said in late December.\n\u201cWenwen is a very powerful tool; not many companies have already adopted such a tool in their own customer journeys,\u201d said Euromonitor\u2019s Yum.\nTo be sure, there\u2019s still room for improvement, which spells opportunity for market leaders. More than 40% of consumers would be comfortable with voice assistants offering personalized recommendations. Still, but less than one-fifth felt the same about using bots to answer complex customer service questions, according to Euromonitor\u2019s 2023 survey.\n\u201cTaobao and Tmall will continue to actively embrace AI technology and work with ecosystem-wide partners and merchants to provide a more intelligent and efficient business experience,\u201d the Taobao and Tmall Group spokesperson said.\nHelping Hand\nGenerative AI solutions also support innovation by merchants, which could accelerate go-to-market strategies by helping speed up content creation and ideation, said Euromonitor International.\nBusinesses that leverage generative AI\u2019s capabilities will be able to synthesize user data faster to guide product development. Plus, integrating customer inputs will help companies customize marketing campaigns, merchandise and services at scale.\nAlibaba International Digital Commerce Group said in November it was piloting Aidge, its first artificial intelligence-powered suite of application programming interfaces. Aidge is built on Alibaba International\u2019s proprietary large language models and computer vision models. Alibaba International is the overseas commerce arm of Alibaba Group, housing Lazada, AliExpress, Alibaba.com and Trendyol among other businesses.\n\u201cAI has emerged as a powerful catalyst, enabling businesses to amplify their strengths and minimizing hurdles such as language and cultural barriers. We are keenly aware of its immense potential, and this is why we are actively piloting Aidge, our commerce-centric AI suite designed for global merchants, in collaboration with industry partners,\u201d said Kaifu Zhang, Vice President of Alibaba International, who leads the company\u2019s AI initiatives.\nThis article was originally published on Alizila, written by Alison Tudor Ackroyd.\nRead previous post:\nTech for Innovation | Alibaba Cloud 2023 Milestones and Highlights\nRead next post:\nTech for Innovation |\u00a0Alibaba Cloud Top 10 Artificial Intelligence Blogs of 2023\nAlibaba Cloud Community\n795 posts | 168 followers\nYou may also like\nAlibaba Cloud Community - January 2, 2024\nAlibaba Clouder - March 22, 2019\nAlibaba Cloud Community - October 28, 2021\nAlibaba Cloud Community - January 14, 2022\nAlibaba Cloud Community - November 23, 2021\nAlibaba Cloud Community - January 18, 2024\nComments\nAlibaba Cloud Community\n795 posts | 168 followers\nRelated Products\nE-Commerce Solution\nAlibaba Cloud e-commerce solutions offer a suite of cloud computing and big data services.\nBlack Friday Cloud Services Sale\nGet started on cloud with $1.

This will include the launch of a dedicated Singapore pavilion and a showcase of SMEs and products from Singapore in a prominent position on Alibaba.com's homepage.\nAlso, as part of the collaboration, Alibaba.com has worked with IMDA and EnterpriseSG to develop its pilot Go Global programme, which consists of curated Go Global packages to make it easier for SMEs to access B2B trade opportunities. Apart from priority placements on the platform for greater visibility, participating SMEs will also be entitled to a myriad of tools and services provided by Alibaba.com, such as specialised digital marketing tools and platform analytics, as well as dedicated consultancy and advisory services. They can also tap on the Alibaba.com Seller Training E-course, which comprises monthly training sessions \u2013 including on topics such as account set-up and business analytics \u2013 and third-party trainings around site designing, product posting and optimisation. Eligible local SMEs can receive up to 70% funding support to onboard the Go Global programme.

        "raw_content": "Alibaba, TikTok woo US with AI and live-streaming e-commerce at CES trade show, setting the tone for 2024\n\u201cWith advances in AI, we are ushering in the next generation of sourcing and empowering small businesses to succeed with our Smart Assistant at their side,\u201d Chris Lu, general manager at Alibaba.com North America, said in a statement last week.\nAlibaba.com\u2019s debut of Smart Assistant showed how ubiquitous AI innovation was at CES this year. No tech giant\u2019s exhibition was complete without showing off its effort in that space.\nBy putting generative AI at the centre of its exhibition, Alibaba.com made it clear where it thought the platform\u2019s advantage lies, despite some grumblings from a marketing manager that the product was not quite yet ready for prime time, according to a brand ambassador at the booth.\nA number of CES attendees at the Alibaba.com presentation were made up of select \u201cgold suppliers\u201d, or those that pay for a premium membership on the platform, according to some exhibitors.\nA test of Smart Assistant by the Post showed the all-too-common limitations of new LLM-powered chatbots. When asked about the best options for sourcing a 10,000-milliampere-hour power bank, it offered a link to search results for the product on Alibaba.com. A follow-up query on the best way to determine differences in quality among suppliers resulted in a generic response about checking certifications and standards.\nTikTok Shop representatives were roaming the CES floor looking for companies they can convince to sell on the platform. That task may have been harder for the US team. A US-based TikTok Shop employee told Shenzhen-based mechanical keyboard maker Keychron that he was not allowed to sign up Chinese companies. Only their team in mainland China can on-board those suppliers.\nTech giants Alibaba, ByteDance lead China\u2019s return to CES\n\u201cTemu or Shein can get those very low-cost items and low-cost shipping because they have the volume,\u201d said Stanley Wong, co-founder and chief product officer of Hong Kong-based Spaceship, which exhibited at CES under its Taiwanese entity. \u201cThey have very professional teams to do that kind of supply chain management.\u201d\nChinese suppliers are also Alibaba.com\u2019s bread and butter. While it is ostensibly a global sourcing platform, the vast majority of companies on Alibaba.com are Chinese, which typically offer big cost advantages owing to the mainland\u2019s vast manufacturing supply chain.\nAlibaba pushes new AI tool to help wholesale merchants manage overseas clients\n\u201cOur focus is to enable individual sellers to\u201d achieve cost-effective supply chain management like Shein and Temu, Spaceship\u2019s Wong said.\nAs more merchants try to control their own brands and reduce the money they lose to platforms like Shein, Temu and TikTok Shop by operating their own sites, services like Spaceship make sense when making price comparisons on logistics solutions.\nStill, Spaceship does not have its own generative AI product yet to take on the likes of Alibaba. The company said it is considering one for customer service.\nMany of the underpinnings of AI LLMs are open-source code, making the technology easily accessible to start-ups even if they do not have the data advantage of tech giants. But it could be some time before the kinks are worked out and these start-ups can handle more sophisticated requirements of business users."

        "raw_content": "Account\nA Look At Alibaba\u2019s Billion-Dollar Plans In S\u2019pore Amid Intensifying Chinese Competition\nAlibaba is one of the Chinese tech giants making Singapore its beachhead for Southeast Asia.\nCompetitors Bytedance and Tencent Holdings are also making investments into Singapore, giving insights into their strategies here.\nPreviously, we took a look at how Bytedance plans to spend \u201cbillions of dollars\u201d in Singapore and what it means for us.\nThis time, we delve into Alibaba\u2019s expansion plans and how it is planning to grow its presence in Singapore.\nBuilding SEA\u2019s Leading E-commerce Logistics Platform\nIn 2014,\u00a0Alibaba\u00a0announced that it invested\u00a0S$312.5 million for a 10.35 per cent stake in\u00a0SingPost.\nThis is the\u00a0first\u00a0overseas postal agency that\u00a0Alibaba\u00a0has invested in and the investment was to \u201cleverage SingPost\u2019s strong delivery networks and end-to-end e-commerce logistics solutions to facilitate international e-commerce\u201d.\nIn China, alongside other investors, Alibaba\u00a0has been working on a\u00a0massive\u00a0logistics and delivery network to enable 24-hour deliveries across the country.\nAlibaba then made a second investment of S$187.1 million, raising its stake in SingPost to 14.4 per cent, making it the second largest shareholder in SingPost after Singtel.\nSubsequently, in 2016, Alibaba also invested S$86.2 million to buy a 34 per cent stake in Quantium Solutions International, a SingPost subsidiary that provides e-commerce logistics and fulfilment services across the Asia Pacific.\nWith these investments, Alibaba is set on building a leading e-commerce logistics platform across Southeast Asia to serve the region\u2019s fast rising e-commerce logistics needs.\n\u201cA robust logistics network is vital to helping our merchants successfully serve the vast population across Southeast Asia and Oceania, and realise Alibaba\u2019s vision to ultimately serve two billion consumers worldwide,\u201d said Daniel Zhang, CEO of Alibaba Group.\nTaking Back The Lead In SEA\u2019s E-commerce Market\nAlibaba already has a controlling stake in\u00a0Lazada, which they acquired back in 2016 to support its international expansion plans.\nOver the years, Alibaba has poured in at least US$4 billion in investments, revamped Lazada\u2019s technology, and sent a host of Alibaba executives to help lead the unit.\nLazada is Alibaba\u2019s most high-profile and costliest investment outside of its home market. In June 2017, it increased its investment in Lazada by an additional US$1 billion, raising its stake from 51 per cent to 83 per cent.\nAlibaba invested another US$2 billion into Lazada in March 2018, and founder Max Bittner was replaced as CEO by Alibaba executive\u00a0Lucy Peng.\nIn August 2018, Lazada became the largest e-commerce operator in SEA based on average monthly web visits.\nIn December 2018, Peng was replaced by Pierre Poignant as CEO of Lazada.\nThe following year, rival Shopee took over Lazada as the top e-commerce platform in the region. Alibaba\u2019s competitor, Tencent Holdings, has a minority stake in Sea Limited, Shopee\u2019s parent company.\nPoignant was later replaced by Chun Li in June this year, marking him as Lazada\u2019s third CEO in just over two years.\nLi has been with Alibaba since 2014, joining as chief technology officer for the company\u2019s B2B division.\nHe moved to Lazada in 2017 and has since served as both group president and CEO of Lazada Indonesia. Prior to Alibaba, Li held leadership positions at Paypal and eBay.\nLazada\u2019s winning e-commerce strategies include live-streaming, which has become a fixture in their \u2018shoppertainment\u2019 strategy as seen in Lazada\u2019s in-app live streaming feature LazLive, blending shopping and entertainment.\nIt allows shoppers, brands, and sellers to interact in real time, as well as provides detailed product demonstrations and the ability to purchase items simultaneously.\nThe app leverages Alibaba\u2019s technology and is said to be the first ecommerce company to launch in-app livestreaming on its platform in November 2018.\nIt is also the only ecommerce platform in Southeast Asia offering the \u2018see-now-buy-now\u2019 feature which offers a closed loop for in-app purchase.\nLazada also plans to build and continue to expand the largest logistics network in the region, whilst catering to the different needs in each market.\nAdditionally, with a tech expert and veteran of one of Alibaba\u2019s domestic online markets, Lazada looks set to win back the leader position for SEA\u2019s online shopping market.\nInvesting S$1.68B In One Of S\u2019pore Prime Office Buildings\nLast May, Alibaba bought a 50 per cent stake in Singapore\u2019s AXA Tower, where Lazada is an anchor tenant.\nThe deal values the 50-storey prime office tower along Shenton Way at S$1.68 billion and cements Alibaba\u2019s presence in Singapore.\nThe stake in AXA Tower is being viewed as solidifying Alibaba\u2019s commitment to the city state.\n\u201cSingapore is an important market for Alibaba Group,\u201d a company spokesman said.\n\u201cThis investment will help fulfil our projected business needs across the Alibaba digital economy, as we continue to strengthen operations in Singapore.\u201d\nThe investment by the tech giant represents a vote of confidence for Singapore and demonstrates Singapore\u2019s attractiveness to technology and e-commerce companies.\nAttaining S\u2019pore\u2019s Digital Bank Licence\nAnt Group, the financial arm of Alibaba, was among the four groups to receive digital banking licenses from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.\nFor Ant, the digital banking license in Singapore means a fresh opportunity for its overseas expansion.\nIt comes as a much needed boost after it shelved what was called the world\u2019s biggest initial public offering due to greater Chinese regulatory scrutiny.\nThe license gives the firm a chance to address the \u201cunderserved\u201d financial needs of young consumers and small and medium businesses in Singapore.\nThis allows them to take deposits and offer services to both retail and corporate customers in a country where most of its 5.7 million population already have bank accounts.\nThe licensees could use the opportunity as a step towards expanding into larger Southeast Asian markets.\nSingapore-based merchants that use Alipay could be potential customers for Ant\u2019s digital-banking services, sparking wider adoption.\nPotential US$3B Investment In Grab\nIt was first reported last September that Alibaba is planning to invest\u00a0US$3 billion in\u00a0Grab\u00a0to use its delivery capabilities and variety of services to bolster its business in SEA.\nPart of the US$3 billion would be used to acquire some of the Grab stock held by US ride-hailing firm Uber Technologies.\nAlibaba rival Tencent has invested in Gojek, which is Grab\u2019s rival. That alone is enough to prompt Alibaba to back a competing service in the region.\nAt a public forum in 2015, Jack Ma had made known that the Group\u2019s goal is to serve two billion consumers, and detailed its intentions of becoming a global company to achieve that aim.\nGrab\u2019s on-demand logistics infrastructure, regional know-how and established partner networks in each country in Southeast Asia will complement Alibaba\u2019s areas of focus in e-commerce and fintech.\nTherefore, if successful, the Chinese giant\u2019s Grab acquisition gives it access to data on millions of users in eight countries, an extensive delivery fleet, and e-wallet and financial services.\nWhy Is S\u2019pore An Important Market For Alibaba?\nSingapore has loads to offer \u2014 a developed infrastructure, political stability, open business policies, a skilled workforce, respect for\u00a0intellectual property rights and more, making it a highly attractive location for investors.\nWe also have a dynamic startup scene and\u00a0is currently home to at least\u00a0five unicorns\u00a0\u2013 Grab, Lazada, Razer, Trax and Sea Limited (before it went public).\nFurthermore, Singapore has always been a \u201cneutral\u201d nation. PM Lee Hsien Loong had said that Singapore would resolutely\u00a0stick to its policy\u00a0of maintaining good ties with the\u00a0US\u00a0and\u00a0China\u00a0even as the two major powers remained at loggerheads.\nSingapore has strong security ties with the US as well as deep economic ties with China \u2013 with the two countries joining hands in three major joint projects in China.\nWith that, we can say that it is relatively safe for any Chinese company to set up their base here and make Singapore its springboard to the rest of SEA.\nWhat Does It Mean For Us?\nMore Job Opportunities\nWith Alibaba\u2019s presence set to grow here, this will potentially create more job vacancies.\nCurrently, on their careers page, they are hiring for over 30 roles, mostly for Ant Group, ranging from Blockchain R&D Engineer to Solution Architect.\nLazada\u2019s job portal has over 186 job openings, ranging from content marketing to campaign management.\nIt is estimated that with Alibaba\u2019s plans in Singapore, it will lead to more demand for e-commerce, logistics, digital marketing, data science and fintech roles, among others.\nIntensified Chinese Competition In Asia\nCompetitors Bytedance and Tencent Holdings are also making inroads into Asia.\nTencent Holdings, the parent company of WeChat, is reported to be\u00a0setting up its regional hub here. Tencent also backs Sea Limited, which is the parent company of Shopee, Lazada\u2019s rival.\nByteDance on the other hand, has leased a whopping 60,000 sq ft space in One Raffles Quay, a Grade A office building located in the central business district (CBD).\nPrivate sources also\u00a0reveal\u00a0that Bytedance is looking to establish a data centre here as well.\nAs Singapore faces a talent crunch, this could mean more intense competition to win talent over to their sides for each tech giant.\nOnline payment platforms AliPay and WeChat Pay may become more adopted here in Singapore and competition will increase.\nBytedance is said to be seeking a payment license as it took over all the shares of an online payment firm, sparking possibility of its foray into payment services.\nHow Alibaba Is Standing Out From Its Rivals\nOverall, the Chinese tech giants seem to have rather different plans and directions. Each of them are focused on different areas of growth, albeit in the online space.\nAlibaba wants to build a leading e-commerce logistics platform across SEA to serve the region\u2019s fast rising e-commerce logistics needs.\nMeanwhile, Tencent has been making deeper forays into the region\u2019s gaming market, with several minority investments such as its stake in Singapore online gaming and e-commerce firm Sea Limited.\nAccording to Reuters, it has plans to develop a full-scale comprehensive hub in Singapore that will house its international game publishing business.\nBytedance focuses more on taking their social media services deeper into Asia and plans to expand beyond TikTok, Singapore-headquartered business messaging service Lark, and music streaming service Resso.\nIt was reported in August that TikTok is\u00a0piloting in Southeast Asia the live-streaming commercial initiatives pioneered in China.\nIt was applying for a digital bank license as well but failed to be selected, dampening its foray into fintech here.\nFeatured Image credit: The Lowdown\nUnlock the knowledge of Asia's tech landscape\nSubscribe to our premium content for just S$99.90 a year.\nMonthly Package\nS$9.90 / month(or S$0.33 / day)\nGain access to all Vulcan Post Premium content for S$9.90 per month.\nAnnual Package\nS$99.90 / year(or S$0.27 / day)\nGain access to all Vulcan Post Premium content for S$99.90 per year.\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nStay updated with Vulcan Post weekly curated news and updates.\nMORE FROM\nVULCAN POST\nSingaporean\nNews Reader\nLifestyle\nNews Reader\nNews Reader\nNews Reader\nNews Reader\nNews Reader\nInternational\nEdition\nVulcan Post aims to be the knowledge hub of Singapore and Malaysia.\n\u00a9 2021 GRVTY Media Pte.
