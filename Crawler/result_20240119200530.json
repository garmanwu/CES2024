We work closely with customers, academia, and institutions providing solutions, products, and technical services to enable next-generation technologies. The collaboration with the Soteria BIG consortium enabled the team to take commercially available DuPont\u2122\u00a0Kapton\u00ae\u00a0film, to build a higher energy density lithium-ion battery with less metal consumption is another example of how DuPont technology helps advance the sustainability goal,\" said David Reichert, Global Business Development Leader for DuPont Electronics & Industrial.\n\"Soteria's mission is not to make the safest batteries, but rather to enable the entire industry to have the safest batteries possible. To accomplish this, Soteria connects companies with complementary skills and needs in projects that benefit everyone,\" said Maddy Cox, Soteria's Global Consortium Director.\nSoteria's open-innovation consortium and licensing structure creates a hub for the development of new technologies and a structure to make them broadly available to the battery industry. \u00a0The materials enabled by this project will have a significant impact on the electric vehicle industry and also reduce the amount of metal that needs to be mined in order to support it, making the whole value chain more environmentally friendly.\nTo see a summary of cell test results, download this report.\nAbout DuPont Electronics & IndustrialDuPont Electronics & Industrial is a global supplier of new technologies and performance materials serving the semiconductor, circuit board, display, digital and flexographic printing, healthcare, aerospace, industrial and transportation industries.

BeyondCapital co-founders Scott Wilson (left) and Sarah Jennings [Photos: BeyondCapital]\nJan 11, 2024\nIn 2023, founders searching for venture capital found fewer investors and less money. Pitchbook reports that the number of U.S. deals in the first three quarters of 2023 was just slightly higher than the number made during the same period in 2018. In North Texas, it was a similar story . But even as investment markets have tightened, Dallas-based Beyond Capital is working to reverse that trend by investing in more startups. In the first quarter of 2024, it\u2019s opening its third fund to new investors. Beyond Capital looks for startups in need of Seed to Series A investment. What piques their interest remains the same: \u201cWe look for disruptive innovation, with a potential 10x return, and we want to exit in three to five years,\u201d said firm Co-Founder and Managing Partner Scott Wilson. They also look for products or services with great IP protection, and a strong team. Wilson and Managing Partner Sarah Jennings launched Beyond Capital\u2019s first fund at the end of 2020 and started investing in 2021. They didn\u2019t plan on another capital raise in the near term, the partners say. But investor feedback revealed an opportunity. \u201cWe sort of said, \u2018Okay we\u2019ll launch one, and see how it goes,\u2019\u201d said Jennings, who co-founded the firm with Wilson. Though the initial plan was to launch a new fund every three to four years, they found that their deal flow had investors coming to them saying: we want in. So, after launching their second fund at the end of 2022, they changed their strategy. Now Beyond Capital Funds has vintage or annual opportunities; each investment period is about 12- to 18 months. Market conditions and focus areas have an impact on fund raises, and vintage funds offer more flexibility because of their shorter cycle. \u201cWe can focus on what makes the most sense and what are the most advantageous opportunities right now, as opposed to trying to look three or four years into the future,\u201d said Jennings. With the first two funds, part of the calculus for investment was a faith-based founder. While they\u2019ll continue to support such startups, faith won\u2019t be used as a criterion to rule founders out. \u201cWe really want to support people that are aligned with us in terms of using technology in an innovative way to put more good into the world,\u201d and that shows up in different ways.

Athlete Meb Keflezighi\nIn August, Predictive Fitness announced that athlete Meb Keflezighi partnered with its AI training app RunDot. Other ideas the firm has invested in include using patented technology to make lithium batteries safer (Soteria) and improving language translation and accessibility with artificial intelligence (Avodah). Startups in Austin and Houston, as well as cities on the East and West Coasts, are also in the Beyond Capital portfolio, and for the right fit, Jennings and Wilson would add internationally headquartered companies, too.

For founders, family offices are proving to be attractive partners with their flexibility and longer-term investment horizons.

With the project concluding soon in the form of robust best practices, Soteria wants to turn the best practices into safe battery packs for immediate adoption in e-bikes. In doing so, Soteria is launching a crowdfunding campaign on StartEngine to provide the resources quickly.\nThis will also mark the first opportunity for non-accredited investors to invest directly into Soteria, allowing them to participate alongside the institutional and accredited investors who have already invested $8.3 million. Soteria's lithium-ion battery safety technology prevents explosions in e-bikes, electric vehicles and other devices by halting potential ignition events before they occur. With a portfolio of over 80 granted patents, Soteria's technology addresses the root cause of these explosions, ensuring the safety of consumers and industries alike.\nTo enable broad access to its technology, Soteria has formed a consortium of over 125 industry leaders, including NASA, Mercedes, Lenovo, and DuPont. This consortium provides a platform for an open discussion of safety problems and solutions in a market projected to exceed $400 billion by 2030 (McKinsey & Company).\n\"Soteria is dedicated to helping the lithium-ion battery industry improve safety, using whatever resources necessary. Our technology is certainly a piece, but we'll be pulling many safety strategies into a new line of safe e-bike battery packs to be produced by our recent acquisition, Voltaplex, to get them to market as quickly as possible,\" remarked Brian Morin, CEO of Soteria. \"We are going to license these designs to the whole industry, and lead the way by launching our own products first.\"\nSoteria has grown its consortium from an initial 12 founding members in 2018 to over 125 today, including some of the most elite names in lithium-ion batteries. Their 2023 year-to-date revenue is 87% higher than last year, having already surpassed $1 million in 2023. Commercial launches using its technology are planned in consumer electronics and micro mobility, with several additional projects that have already begun in the electric vehicle market. With the support of the consortium members, Soteria is set to help raise the safety standard across industries, especially those that rely so heavily on lithium-ion batteries.\nTo become part of this transformative journey and support Soteria's crowdfunding campaign, please visit the campaign page on StartEngine at startengine.com/offering/soteria.\nAbout\u00a0Soteria Battery Innovation Group, Inc.Soteria is a lithium-ion battery safety platform that includes both a technology to eliminate battery fires and consortium to promote best practices for lithium-ion battery safety.

        "raw_content": "SVOLT sources cell technology from Soteria\nSVOLT, the battery cell manufacturer that emerged from the Chinese carmaker Great Wall, has announced new lithium-ion cells that will use safety technology from Soteria Battery Innovation Group (BIG) for the first time. The market launch of these cells is planned for the third quarter of 2021.\nThe technology eliminates the root cause of thermal runaway, in which the electrolyte in the cell ignites, potentially causing a fire, according to a statement from SVOLT. SVOLT wants to produce cells with NMC-811 chemistry using the materials licensed from Soteria BIG. So this is not about the company\u2019s first cobalt-free battery cells, which will roll off the production line from June this year.\nThe Soteria Battery Innovation Group is based in the US state of South Carolina. The company, founded in 2017, describes itself as an open consortium of companies that wants to license its own developed materials and production methods to as many cell manufacturers as possible. According to Soteria, the technology is compatible with various chemistries such as NMC811, NMC523, NMC622, LFP and LCO. The goal is to convert lithium battery materials from the existing dangerous and heavy architecture to the safer and lighter Soteria architecture, Soteria BIG informs on its homepage. The consortium is aiming for a market share of 25 % by 2030. In addition to SVOLT, Soteria lists a whole range of companies as members on its website, including the battery manufacturers Saft, Xalt Energy, Customcells and Britishvolt, as well as Voith, Bosch and Rimac.\nSoteria has published several videos on the technology itself. The consortium relies on an innovative paper-based separator material, which alone is supposed to withstand temperatures of up to 300 degrees and, supplemented by aramid fibres, up to 550 degrees. The material burns but does not melt, so it continues to fulfil its task of separating the anode and the cathode, they say. The anode and cathode themselves are covered with metallised plastic films (the anode uses aluminium, the cathode copper as a metallic additive). According to Soteria BIG, when exposed to excessive heat, the thin metallised plastic film melts in the area where it is affected and acts as a fuse in the area where the defect occurred. As a result, the battery continues to function even after damage.\nAccording to SVOLT, the technology is able to improve energy density and weight in addition to the safety aspect. Specifically announced are optimised pouch cells of 5Ah, 10Ah, 20Ah and 60Ah, as well as prismatic 60Ah cells for all-electric vehicles and aircraft. \u201cSVOLT has produced high-quality NMC 811 cells with our materials that have exceptional abuse tolerance,\u201d expresses Carl Hu, CTO at Soteria BIG. \u201cWhen Soteria Battery Innovation Group releases its safety certification standard, we expect SVOLT cells to be the first to pass it.\u201d The background is that Soteria plans to develop \u201ca set of aggressive testing standards\u201d that will be \u201cadopted in electronics, electric vehicles, energy storage and the entire lithium-ion battery industry\u201d.\nThe fact that SVOLT is now expected to be the first group to implement the technology is related to the manufacturer\u2019s early interest in the consortium. SVOLT is a \u201cfounding member of our consortium in China\u201d, says Soteria BIG.\nThe Great Wall spin-off is aiming for a global production capacity of 200 GWh and seven R&D centres worldwide by 2025. Against this background, the company announced in February that it would expand production capacities in China. New factories are planned in Huzhou in China\u2019s Zhejiang province and in Suining in Sichuan province, with annual capacities of 20 GWh each.\nIn November 2020, SVOLT had also announced its intention to build a battery cell factory with a capacity of 24 GWh in Germany. Cell production is to start by the end of 2o23, and modules and packs are also to be assembled from the battery cells at another site in Saarland. According to a 2020 announcement, the Chinese company wants to invest a total of up to two billion euros in the state for the two locations, and up to 2,000 jobs are to be created in the final expansion stage.\nMeanwhile, SVOLT has put a lot of development work into creating cobalt-free cells. A few days ago, mass production of the cobalt-free cathode material for the company\u2019s NMX battery cells started in Jintan, China. The cobalt-free battery cells based on it are to be manufactured from June. The Chinese battery cell maker had first announced the cobalt-free cells in 2019 and provided initial details in May 2020. The first cell variants have been available for order since mid-December.\nprnewswire.com\nTags\n0 Comments\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.
