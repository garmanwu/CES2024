ChatGPT-enabled infotainment\nVolkswagen announced that it has integrated the AI-based chatbot ChatGPT into its IDA voice assistant, ushering in a new era in automotive technology.\nThe advancement was enabled by the firm's collaboration with Cerene Inc. via its Chat Pro system. The feature will be offered in the current generation of Volkswagen models based on its MEB and MQB Evo platforms and those that use its IDA voice assistant.\nVolkswagen\nBy integrating with Cerence Chat Pro, the innovation enhances the functionalities of the IDA voice assistant. Users will be able to control a range of functions spanning from infotainment and navigation to air conditioning control, all using voice commands. Additionally, it can also provide answers to general questions, ending those in-car arguments.\nThe integration of ChatGPT through Cerence Chat Pro is designed with a focus on user privacy and data protection by excluding access to any vehicle-specific information.\nThis feature will be accessible across a range of Volkswagen models from early 2024, including the new Tiguan and Passat, the new Golf, and the ID.3, ID.4, ID.5, and ID.7.\n4. Honda's 'O' EV lineup\nThe Japanese automaker unveiled its 'Honda 0 Series', a new electric vehicle (EV) lineup set to hit North American roads from 2026 onwards. The company also unveiled a brand-new emblem for the iconic 'H mark'. The emblem will be exclusively reserved for the upcoming generation of EV models.\nTwo concept vehicles in the Honda 0 Series were also premiered at CES 2024 \u2014 Saloon\u00a0and\u00a0Space-Hub. The Saloon represents the leading concept model within its new EV series, developed from the brand's philosophy of being \"Thin, Light, and Wise.\" The model, which is built on a new EV-only platform, features a low-floor, sporty dynamics, and efficient powertrains. The streamlined and futuristic design of the Saloon features a wedged nose, a flowing roofline, gullwing doors, and a high-set rear.\nThe Space Hub was developed\u00a0under the theme of \u201caugmenting people's daily lives\". The car features a panoramic roof and is designed to complement passengers seated facing each other at the back of the vehicle.\nWhile specific details on the powertrain and battery capacities available for the Honda 0 Series were not released, the company claims that all models will feature e-axles, which integrate the motor, inverter, and gearbox into the car's axle. Honda also claims these cars will support rapid charging, with a 15 to 80 percent charge taking less than 15 minutes.\nEnvisioning a greener automotive industry, Honda also shared its intention to make everything it produces and does carbon-neutral by 2050. The company confidently stated that it aims to sell only EVs and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) globally by 2040.\n3. Sony's updated Afeela EV\nAt CES 2024, Sony announced the updated Afeela, a concept EV that was originally unveiled last year, by driving it onto the stage using a PS5 controller. A joint venture project with Honda as part of Sony Honda Mobility (SHM), the Afeela is an evolution from Sony's Vision S concept.\nIn addition to its remote control operations, the company also showcased a range of updates to the Afeela concept. Along with offering an array of games, the company's collaboration with Epic Games has now enabled augmented reality (AR) mapping. Utilizing data from the car's myriad sensors, and powered by the powerful Unreal Engine 5, SHM now offers immersive 3D maps of the car's surroundings, enhancing safety for occupants.\nSHM also plans to utilize this technology in gaming and entertainment domains as well, for which it is collaborating with virtual reality player Polyphony Digital. The partnership aims to create an immersive experience within the car.\nIn a strategic move, SHM has entered into an agreement with Microsoft, tapping into the Azure OpenAI Service to create a conversational, personal, customized agent for Afeela. SHM is also unlocking the doors of Afeela's developer space to create a platform for creators and developers to innovate and construct applications and services compatible with the EV.\nSHM has announced that it will start taking preorders for Afeela in 2025, with deliveries scheduled to begin in the spring of 2026. With two behemoths in the technology and automotive space joining hands to innovate, we expect much more to come out of the Afeela project in the coming years.\n2. Snapdragon Digital Chassis\nQualcomm Technologies and Robert Bosch GmbH announced the automotive industry\u2019s first central vehicle computer that is capable of hosting both infotainment and advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) functionalities on a single system-on-chip (SoC).\nThe advancement will enable a central system to handle tasks related to safety and security requirements, advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS), and automated driving requirements.\nThe cockpit and ADAS integration platform utilizes the Snapdragon Ride Flex System-on-Chip (SoC), which is an advanced and adaptable solution designed to support mixed-criticality workloads and offer high-performance capabilities. \"With this cost-effective solution, we are paving the way for bringing even more ADAS functions into vehicles, including in the entry-level and mid-range segment,\" said Christoph Hartung, president of the Cross-Domain Computing Solutions division at Bosch, in a statement.\nmetamorworks/iStock\nQualcomm's Snapdragon Digital Chasis is already offering a suite of functionalities starting with the Snapdragon Auto Connectivity Platform that provides seamless and secure connectivity, cloud services, and over-the-air updates for vehicles. Meanwhile, the Snapdragon Cockpit Platform provides immersive experiences with features like high-resolution displays, 3D audio, voice, and gesture recognition, and augmented reality for both drivers and passengers.\nOn the other hand, the Snapdragon Ride Platform utilizes AI and computer vision to drive advanced driver assistance and autonomous driving features, including lanekeeping, adaptive cruise control, and collision avoidance. Lastly, the Snapdragon Car-to-Cloud ensures secure and scalable cloud connectivity, data management, and analytics tailored for vehicles.\n1. World's first digital cockpit\nStellantis, BlackBerry QNX, and AWS have teamed up to unveil\u00a0a first-of-its-kind virtual cockpit for automobiles at this year's CES.\nPart of the group's Virtual Engineering Workbench (VEW), the platform will greatly accelerate the delivery of cutting-edge car technology to customers. The key to this acceleration lies in the utilization of QNX Hypervisor in the cloud from BlackBerry, which functions as a virtual lab for developing car controls and systems.\nThe platform enables the creation of \"realistic virtual versions of car controls and systems, making them behave just like they would in a real car, but without needing to change the main software that runs them, taking what used to take months to be achieved down to 24 hours in some cases,\u201d according to a statement from the company.\nThrough the utilization of QNX Hypervisor via AWS Marketplace, Stellantis can now introduce an advanced simulation of a virtual cockpit into a cloud-based environment. The collaboration between Stellantis and AWS, a prominent cloud services provider, was established in January 2022.\nAccording to Stellantis, the virtual cockpit platform is equipped with impressive tools for the virtualization of graphics, audio, and inputs from the touchscreen, mouse, and keyboard. \"Software is becoming increasingly crucial in vehicles, leading us to innovate in how we develop and validate it. With our virtual cockpit, we're revolutionizing not just our approach, but also that of our suppliers and partners in the industry,\" said Yves Bonnefont, Chief Software Officer at Stellantis, in a statement."

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Roundup: Automotive Highlights from the World's Largest Tech Show\nSummary\nRelated Articles\nSummary\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas is where some of the biggest tech news of the year is announced. More than 4,000 exhibitors are at the show this year, with cutting-edge tech covering nearly every area imaginable. It\u2019s the cars we\u2019re interested in, though, and there were plenty of announcements from automakers ranging from new audio systems to entirely new models. Here are the automotive highlights of CES 2024.\nGoogle Built-In\nGoogle announced updates to Android Auto that would add real-time EV range information to Google Maps. The feature will launch with the Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning, showing you the estimated battery level at arrival, suggesting charge stops, and estimating charging times along the way. Volvo EVs and some GM EVs already have this feature, and it\u2019s very helpful because it helps curb range anxiety. It adds predictability, offers more choice, and lets you select your route based on your charge without relying on the car\u2019s built-in navigation system.\nGoogle Built-In, the operating system used by Volvo and GM, among others, is adding the Chrome web browser (for use when parked). The system also adds The Weather Channel app to show you the weather along your route.\nHonda EV Concepts\nHonda brought two concept cars to debut what it calls the Honda 0 (Zero) Series, a new line of EVs that will launch in 2026. \u201cThe mobility we dream of is not an extension of the trend of \u2018thick, heavy, but smart\u2019 EVs,\u201d said Toshihiro Mibe, Global CEO of Honda. \u201cWe will create a completely new value from zero based on thin, light and wise as the foundation for our new Honda 0 EV series to further advance the joy and freedom of mobility to the next level.\u201d\nThe concept above with the rectangular nose and gullwing doors is called the Saloon. Its stance is low and wide. Honda says a vehicle based on this concept will arrive in 2026, and it marks not just a new era for Honda electrification, but its styling is nothing like what we've seen from the brand so far.\nThe chunkier concept is called the Space-Hub. Honda didn\u2019t mention if we\u2019d see something in production based on this one, but it might preview what an Odyssey minivan might look like in the future.\nHonda 0 Series models will get the company\u2019s most advanced autonomous driving features. They will also have new e-Axles that the company says will deliver high levels of power and efficiency, along with a battery that Honda says will not degrade more than 10 per cent after 10 years of use.\nHyundai All-In on Hydrogen\nHyundai presented its vision for hydrogen-powered vehicles including passenger vehicles and heavy trucks going forward. The brand remains heavily invested in the tech and plans to develop new large-scale green hydrogen production solutions. It is also concentrating on tech that can deliver hydrogen for vehicles from organic waste (including manure) as well as from melting waste plastics.\nThe company said it expects to have vehicles using 3 million tonnes of hydrogen per year by 2035, enough to drive a passenger vehicle 3 billion km. For reference, passenger vehicle traffic in Canada is approximately 333 billion km per year.\nKia Shows Electric Vans\nKia brought a series of concepts for a future commercial electric van. The Platform Beyond Vehicle concepts offer innovative features like vehicle bodies that can be removed and swapped out quickly. Kia suggests that you could use the van for a taxi by day, a delivery van by night, and a camper on the weekend. Kia emphasized software in the concepts, with the goal of improved charge management and better fleet management. The first planned for production is the PV5, the second largest of the four, built at a new plant capable of handling 150,000 units per year.\nLamborghini Performance Biometrics\nThe Lamborghini Telemetry X concept is in-car tech meant to make you a better driver on track. It captures your biometric data for performance monitoring to help you train off the track and monitors your lap times, lines, and pedal performance to help make you faster. Lamborghini says the system offers proactive voice assistance in the vehicle to help you brake and turn at the right spot.\nMercedes Debuts New Infotainment System\nMercedes-Benz announced that its new MB.OS system, first announced two years ago, will make it into vehicles soon. It will offer an AI virtual assistant that Benz says will \u201ccreate an even more natural and intuitive relationship with the car.\u201d The company says the system will allow more natural interaction with the car\u2019s voice command system. It will also include enhanced 3D graphics for the navigation system that can show the driver hazards around the road. More apps will be added, including games, streaming, and even food-ordering apps.\nIn collaboration with Amazon Music and Audible, Benz will add Dolby Atmos to its Burmester audio systems. Benz says Atmos audio, used in movie theatres to provide a more immersive experience, should do the same for in-car listeners. \u201cImmersive audio storytelling enables our customers to benefit fully from the advanced sound technology in our vehicles. For us, unparalleled in-car entertainment is a further dimension of the hyper-personalized user experience,\u201d said Mercedes-Benz CTO Markus Sch\u00e4fer.\nVinFast Shows Cute EV and Wild Pickup Concept\nElectric startup VinFast Auto brought a pair of concepts including the minicar VF 3 and the VF wild pickup concept.\nThe VF 3 is on sale now in Vietnam and is making its debut for the rest of the world \u2013 though there are no details on Canadian availability. It\u2019s small, about half a metre shorter than a Mitsubishi Mirage, and offers an estimated 202 km of range, which isn\u2019t bad considering the $15k price tag in its home country.\nVinFast\u2019s first pickup, the VF Wild, is likely to be much more relevant to Canadians if it makes it to market. The Wild is about the size of a Honda Ridgeline, but powered by electricity. It offers a flexible bed with a midgate (the new EV pickup hot ticket) that lets you extend the bed by using the back seats of the cab, and it has clamshell doors like the best early 2000s trucks. It\u2019s still just a concept, though, with no announcements of any production plans.\nVolkswagen's New AI Assistant\nVolkswagen announced a new digital assistant called IDA, based on ChatGPT AI. VW says it will control infotainment including navigation as well as climate control. It can also answer general knowledge questions and have a conversation with you. The refreshed Golf will get the feature, along with the ID.3, 4, 5, and ID.7 models, as well as the new Tiguan, with arrivals starting in 2024.\nVW also showed off the refreshed Golf GTI. Though the hot hatch was masked by camouflage, we can see some of the detailing including new head and tail lights.\nRelated Articles\nAbout Us\nDealer Services\nResources\nPartners\nCustomer Support"

        "raw_content": "The Best Car And Technology Reveals From CES 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show is more important than ever in the automotive realm.\nCES 2024 has just wrapped up in Las Vegas with a strong showing from automakers and automotive-related tech companies. More than just concepts, these displays preview what will soon be a reality in the cars we drive, which is why we've selected 10 technologies and vehicles revealed at this year's event that will impact the automotive realm.\nOnce again, manufacturers and suppliers brought their A-game. These are our favorite car and technology reveals from CES 2024. We didn't pick these randomly, either; all of these represent technology that will reach the mainstream sooner than you know.\nWhat Is CES And Why Does Matter?\nAutomotive manufacturers and technology producers used to stick to their own lanes, but the line between the two is becoming increasingly blurry. That's why the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) has become a popular platform for automakers and suppliers to showcase new automotive technology, and CES 2024 was a hotbed for automotive innovation.\nA decade ago, the most advanced piece of technology in a car was the infotainment system, but we now live in the era of permanently connected vehicles. And let's not forget about electric cars, which run on platforms that have allowed engineers and designers to explore and push through existing automotive boundaries.\n1. Facial Recognition\nContinental Automotive showcased its new Face Authentication Display, which uses biometric recognition to identify the owner and anyone authorized to use whatever car. There are cameras mounted in the B-pillar and instrument cluster. You walk up, and the car recognizes you, unlocks, and activates. And before you ask, the answer is no. You can't access the vehicle using a photograph or mask.\nThe humble car key was good enough for a hundred years, but Mercedes-Benz changed the game when it introduced the W220 S-Class Sedan in 1999. It was the first car equipped with a key that sent out a unique frequency, which unlocked the vehicle as the driver. Nowadays, it's a common piece of tech, and automakers constantly try to outdo each other with new smartphone-based key technology.\nFacial recognition is already widely used in the smartphone industry, and it's only a matter of time before it filters down into cars. This tech could also help detect inebriation, preventing you from driving drunk.\n2. Hyundai Mobis Mobion\nThe Mobion is a Hyundai Ioniq 5 with unique bumpers and lights, but that's not why it's here. It's here because it showcases what's possible when you mount an electric motor within each of the four wheels. Since the wheels are self-contained units, they can rotate individually within the wheel well.\nHyundai Mobis (the automaker's technology arm) used the Mobion to demonstrate Pivot Turn, Diagonal Drive, Zero Turn, and Reverse Drive. It's the most agile car we've ever seen in action, and a system like this will make parking in congested cities like Los Angeles a joy.\n3. BMW's Augmented Reality Glasses\nBMW brought many of its latest gadgets to CES, but the one that stood out was the wearable XREAL Air 2 augmented reality glasses.\nInstead of projecting information on a head-up display, these glasses will force the real and digital realms to unite fantastically. You put them on, and you'll see navigation and hazard information, points of interest, and even entertainment content. The theory is that the world around you can be presented in a new light, and we imagine rod closures, accidents, and even things like potholes can be made visible long before you arrive on the scene. Plus, points of interest like restaurants can be highlighted, and we'd imagine the tech can be extended to allow passengers (particularly children) to play games by interacting with the world around them.\n4. Harman Ready Vision QVUE & AR HUD\nHarman came to CES prepared with several creations OEMs will be studying carefully in the coming months. We're big fans of Ready Vision QVUE and the innovative head-up display. The scalable technology can be easily applied to affordable EVs like the Chevrolet Equinox and high-end luxury barges like the Cadillac Escalade IQ, as the technology can utilize a small area or become a full-width HUD.\nReady Vision projects valuable information on the lower part of the windscreen, and it can utilize augmented reality to project navigation over the road in front of you to enhance the HUD experience. Owners can also install third-party apps from the Harman Ignite Store, adding to the information on display with things like charge states, 3D navigation, and real-time traffic, and you could even order take-out.\n5. VinFast VF 3\nVinFast got off to a rocky start in the USA, but that didn't stop the automaker from introducing the VF 3 at CES.\nWe didn't get many details about the tiny electric SUV, but VinFast provided the most important number: a projected starting price of under $20,000. VinFast is also setting up shop in the USA, which means the VF 3 could potentially qualify for the $7,500 federal tax credit.\nApply that, and you get a starting price of $12,500. The estimated range may only be 125 miles, but that low price will be mighty attractive to people who don't travel long distances.\nIf a tiny crossover isn't your thing, the Vietnamese brand also revealed a pickup truck concept called the VF Wild, inspired by superhero costumes.\n6. Kia Platform Beyond Vehicle Solutions\nKia introduced five concept vehicles at CES 2024, showcasing the future of electric commercial vehicles. The PV1, PV5, and PV7 were all designed to be robust, modular, and clever tools. They're boxy by design and boast a weldless body structure that can accommodate interchangeable upper bodies.\nWe'll use the PV5 as an example. During the day, it can be used as a last-mile delivery vehicle. After its shift is done, the owner can put the minivan-like body on top and send it out to serve as a taxi.\n7. Mercedes-Benz And Amazon Music\nMercedes-Benz announced a collaboration with Audible and Amazon Music. The new E-Class and CLE will be the first models to benefit from this partnership, and both features will be rolled out in Q3 this year.\nWhy does this matter? If you're an audiophile, you'll know that Amazon Music with Dolby Atmos was introduced last year. Basically, the sound quality is so good that you feel immersed in it rather than listening to it. In reality, you'll be stuck in traffic but feel like you're in the golden circle at a Pearl Jam concert.\nThis was just one of several pieces of tech the German automaker brought, including a new AI virtual assistant bound for the new CLA-Class and a collaboration with will.i.am that creates music based on your driving inputs.\n8. Volkswagen Golf GTI And ChatGPT\nVolkswagen announced that it will implement ChatGPT into its upcoming infotainment systems, starting with the Mk8.5 Golf GTI, making the voice assistant more powerful. Cerence Chat Pro will back VW's system and will be capable of so much more than turning the temperature up by a few degrees.\nAccording to VW, this will benefit all occupants. You can answer the car questions or converse with it when alone.\nWe're on the fence about this one. On the one hand, having a Golf GTI as a friend would be cool. Conversely, we've seen Her and how prone people are to fall in love with an AI system. Plus, our social battery gets depleted from interacting with people and recharged by driving, so why would we want to detract from our happy place by being forced to converse with it to get basic functions done?\n9. Lamborghini Digital Driver Coach\nWhen it comes to supercars, there's one universal truth. Driving talent doesn't increase in correlation with the size of your wallet. In short, you may have $500,000 to splurge on a Lamborghini Revuelto, but that doesn't mean you have the talent to exploit its capabilities.\nThat's what Lamborghini wants to fix with Telemetry X. This system can send recordings of on-track performance and telemetry to a driving coach who will provide live feedback. It won't make you a Formula 1 ace, but you'll be able to get the most out of the Revuelto's 1,000 horses. It can also tap into your biometrics to provide enhanced coaching, and the virtual assistant will give you feedback as you drive, telling you if you're faster or slower of if your brakes are overheating. It's like having your own version of Gianpiero Lambiase in the car with you.\n10. Zeekr 007\nThe owners of the James Bond IP probably won't allow the Zeekr 007 to go into production sporting that name, but that's not important right now. The fact that Zeekr chose the Las Vegas-based CES to showcase one of its models is a grand statement of intent. The 007 isn't new (it was revealed at the end of December 2023), but this surely means Zeekr wants to become the first Chinese manufacturer to do business in the USA.\nThe Chinese-spec model has a dual-motor setup that produces 636 horsepower and a range of 540 miles. Is that enough to get people out of their Teslas? How will the market respond to a Chinese-built vehicle, especially since the government has made no secret that it does not want China to send its product here?"

Image courtesy of NVIDIA.\nLatest in APDRC\nAPDRC Resources\nDell\nLatest News\nJanuary 15, 2024\nAt this year\u2019s International CES (Consumer Electronics Show, Las Vegas, Nevada, Jan. 9-12), NVIDIA made a special address, highlighting technology that the company says will usher in a new wave of AI-ready hardware and applications.\n\u201cToday, NVIDIA is at the center of the latest technology transformation: generative AI,\u201d said Jeff Fisher, senior VP for GeForce, NVIDIA. \u201cNVIDIA\u2019s RTX\u2122 GPUs, with more than 100 million units shipped, are pivotal in the burgeoning field of generative AI, exemplified by innovations like ChatGPT and Stable Diffusion.\u201d\nWhile CES caters to the consumer crowd, NVIDIA\u2019s consumer-targeted initiatives are often precursors to what\u2019s coming down the pike in the professional portfolios.\nThe company points out, \u201cMobile workstations with RTX GPUs can run\u00a0NVIDIA AI Enterprise\u00a0software, including NVIDIA TensorRT\u2122\u00a0and\u00a0NVIDIA RAPIDS\u2122 for simplified, secure generative AI and data science development. A three-year license for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is included with every\u00a0NVIDIA A800 40GB Active GPU, providing an ideal workstation development platform for AI and data science.\u201d\nAI\u2019s Impact on Robotics\nOne area where NVIDIA expects AI-powered natural language processing to accelerate developments is in the field of robotics. Deepu Talla, VP of Robotics and Edge Computing, NVIDIA, believes the tipping point for a robotic transformation is coming soon.\nHe said, \u201cGenerative AI models achieve higher accuracy while generalizing rather well. And applications are built using natural language prompts or texts. Given these attributes, generative AI is well-suited for robotics.\u201d The same AI model, he added, could also help generate synthetic data to augment the collected data.\nNVIDIA\u2019s platform for training and developing autonomous robots is NVIDIA Isaac Sim\u2122, a robotic simulation platform. For robotic training, in addition to the model of the robot itself, users usually need to create a replica of the environment where the robot operates, such as warehouses and factory floors. The use of natural language is already starting to transform how users create and populate these dynamic environments.\nTalla said, \u201cStarting with NVIDIA PICASSO, you can use a text-to-object generative AI model to generate new assets and place them in the scene. With a text prompt, generative AI can add rain, water, rust, and more to existing environments. Tasks that typically take an artist days, can be completed in minutes.\u201d\nCobots and robots performing tasks alongside human operators are expected to meet regulatory requirements, which set the safety protocols: for example, the speed and velocity with which they move. Gerard Andrews, Senior Product Manager for Robotics, NVIDIA, said, \u201cWe have active engagement with a number of regulatory bodies. We look at proactive safety, reactive safety, and predictive safety. We are participating in efforts to drive the three concepts and are pushing for a number of safety standards.\u201d\nOmniverse-Powered Car Configurators\nNVIDIA is also promoting its immersive 3D simulation platform NVIDIA Omniverse\u2122 to automakers at CES. This time, the attraction is the Omniverse-powered car configurators, developed and marketed by BITONE, Brickland, Configit, Katana Studio Ltd., WPP, ZeroLight, and other partners.\n\u201cOEMs benefit from a unified asset pipeline that simplifies the integration of design and engineering data for marketing purposes. Omniverse\u2019s enhanced tools also allow them to quickly produce diverse marketing materials, boosting customer engagement through customized content,\u201d NVIDIA points out in its announcement. When running on NVIDIA Graphics Delivery Network, the automotive configurators can be easily published at scale and streamed to most devices around the world.\u201d\n(You can read more about one of these configurator applications in our previous coverage here.)\nNVIDIA also spotlighted in particular Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Kodiak, and Pebble as automakers who have infused AI-powered features in their vehicle lines and are showcasing them at the conference.\n\u201cMercedes-Benz is also using digital twins for production with help from\u00a0NVIDIA Omniverse, a platform for developing applications to design, collaborate, plan and operate manufacturing and assembly facilities \u2026 Kodiak\u00a0is exhibiting an autonomous truck, which relies on NVIDIA RTX GPUs for high-performance compute to process the enormous quantities of data it collects from its cameras, radar and lidar sensors,\u201d NVIDIA announced.\nIn a briefing with the industry press, Danny Shapiro, VP of Automotive, NVIDIA, said, \u201cWith Omniverse-powered configurators, consumers can experience the car exactly as they want . They can customize the leather, the trim, the wheels, and then take the car out for a virtual test drive. For developers, they can even simulate the software that runs inside the car.\u201d\nYou can learn more in blogs that NVIDIA published during CES about its robotics and automotive capabilities.\nMore Dell Coverage\nMore NVIDIA Coverage\nShare This Article\nSubscribe to our FREE magazine,\nFREE email newsletters or both!\nLatest News\nRelated Topics\nDigital Engineering\nhttps://www.digitalengineering247.com//article/ai-drives-robotics-and-automotive-configurators-at-ces-2024/\nhttps://www.digitalengineering247.com//article/ai-drives-robotics-and-automotive-configurators-at-ces-2024/\nLast updated January 16, 2024\nDesign\nSimulate\nPrototype\nDigital Thread\nComputing\nDepartments"

        "raw_content": "AI Online\nAi INNOVATION, SINCE 1895\nThe Future is Now: Continental Innovates Mobility from the Road to the Cloud at CES\u00ae 2024\n\u201cWe are advancing technology solutions for the new era of mobility,\u201d said Aruna Anand, President and CEO, Continental Automotive, North America. \u201cContinental has an impact on almost every aspect of the vehicle. By leveraging our expertise in software-driven mobility, we are shaping the future of mobility. At CES 2024, we\u2019ll demonstrate how we\u2019re making mobility safer, exciting, and autonomous.\u201d\nBuilding a new space within the vehicle\nAs the car becomes an essential integrated space to interact with all aspects of personal and professional life, the user experience becomes a key factor for car buyers. Continental will demonstrate innovations that enable a novel and creative user experience.\nDuring CES 2024, exciting, intuitive, and award-winning user displays will be front and center for Continental. Showcased for the first time, the Crystal Center Display demonstrates the next generation of technology and highlights innovative design possibilities while matching the trend for luxury appearance. For a more subtle effect, the Curved In2visible Display integrates seamlessly into the cockpit enabling new design possibilities and turning a vehicle into a living room on wheels.\nAs vehicles integrate more software and take on functions like computers and smartphones, they must also become more secure. Continental has considered this with its Face Authentication Displays. These are the highest security standards for smooth car entry and safe vehicle start. The \u201cliveness check\u201d ensures only the driver, or those registered to the vehicle\u2019s profile, can secure access.\nIncreasing mobile computing power\nIn addition to becoming more automated, vehicle technology is increasingly more connected. Connected vehicles make driving safer and more convenient. To support such new functions, cars have become computers on wheels. Software-defined vehicles and connected mobility require more intelligence and computing power, but current vehicle architectures are reaching their limits. Continental\u2019s Smart Cockpit High-Performance Computer (HPC), in collaboration with Google Cloud, demonstrates how the Smart Cockpit HPC enables the mobility experience of the future. Together, the two companies are equipping cars with generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), making Continental one of the first automotive suppliers to integrate Google Cloud capabilities directly into vehicle computers. With this, drivers can interact with their car in a natural dialogue. Whether drivers need help finding the right tire pressure when the car is fully loaded or want to know more about local places of interest at their destination or along the route when they are on vacation, the generative AI can compile the required information and answer the drivers\u2019 questions.\nDeveloping the future of driverless transportation\nThe Radar Vision Parking solution, named a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree, enables Level 3 and Level 4 driving and parking functions of software-defined vehicles. By combining high-resolution surround radars with high-resolution cameras, Continental enables parking use cases that require very precise and close-range measurement around the vehicle. Early parking slot detection, for example, lets users park in a single stroke without driving past the spot.\nVisitors will also experience the power of partnerships with Aurora Innovation\u2019s autonomous technology. In this first-of-its-kind partnership, Continental is responsible for industrializing the autonomous driving system kits which will leverage a wide spectrum of Continental\u2019s extensive automotive product portfolio from sensors, automated driving control units (ADCU), high performance computers (HPC), telematics units and more, to the complete fallback system which covers the full chain of effects. Continental will integrate these hardware components into pods which will be supplied to Aurora\u2019s vehicle manufacturing partners. This will advance the product offering for autonomous trucking customers.\nAlso on display will be the Full Stack Automated Driving Solution with Ambarella. Continental contributes the hardware and large parts of the software to this partnership, while Ambarella provides the System-on-Chip (SoC) platform and further software functionalities. Compared to other domain controller SoCs, Ambarella\u2019s \u201cCV3-AD\u201d chip family provides higher performance to process sensor data faster and more comprehensively for greater environmental perception and safer mobility, at up to five times higher power efficiency. As a result of this strategic partnership, the next generation of vehicles, ranging from L2+ to the highest automation levels, will be able to utilize the powerful, energy-efficient, and scalable mobility system solutions from Continental and Ambarella.\nContinental at CES 2024\nContinental will showcase its latest technologies at a private structure exhibit in Central Plaza across from the Las Vegas Convention Center from Tuesday, January 9 through Friday, January 12. The technology company has numerous solutions that highlight mobility innovations, from the road to the cloud. An invitation-only media event has been scheduled for January 9.
