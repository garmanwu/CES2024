Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2023: everything you need to know about this year's technology expo\nCES 2023 is underway \u2013 here\u2019s what we expect to see\n- Best TVs at CES 2023\n- Best laptops at CES 2023\n- Best audio tech at CES 2023\n- Best home tech at CES 2023\n- Best fitness tech at CES 2023\n- Best electric car tech at CES 2023\nAfter two consecutive years spent stuck in virtual mode, CES returned in all its in-person glory last year to deliver a host of exciting announcements on everything from the latest TV technology to cutting-edge laptop hardware.\nCES 2023 is now underway, and we're already seeing an equally large number of headline-grabbing reveals in all manner of tech categories from manufacturers including Samsung, Sony, LG, and Panasonic.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2023 in-person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen \u2013 and below, we\u2019ve speculated on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase (check out the adjacent quick links box for what's already been revealed in specific product categories).\nCES 2023 dates and hours\nCES 2023 will run from Thursday, January 5 until Sunday, January 8, 2023.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 5 (11:30am ET on January 5 / 4:30pm GMT on January 5 / 2:30am AEST on January 6).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 5\n9am - 6pm PT Friday, January 6\n9am - 6pm PT Saturday, January 7\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 8\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 5pm PT on Thursday, January 5, until Saturday, January 7.\nHow to register for CES 2023\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2023 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2023 registration page and fill out the appropriate form \u2013 there\u2019s one for people who attended in 2020 or 2022 and another for people who are new to CES (or attended in 2020 or 2021 but have a new email address).\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung\nAs one of the biggest brands in attendance at CES 2023, Samsung will, as usual, be holding a dedicated press conference to make its share of announcements. The South Korean company\u2019s theme for this year\u2019s show is \u2018Bringing Calm to Our Connected World\u2019, which suggests it\u2019ll be focusing on smart home products over swanky new TVs or laptops.\nThat\u2019s not to say we won\u2019t be hearing any news on the QD-OLED or Galaxy front, but the recent integration between the Matter smart home standard and Samsung\u2019s SmartThings device range has us expecting to see Samsung put a host of smart home-related reveals front and center.\nSony\nSony is a real enigma when it comes to CES plans \u2013 you never know whether you\u2019re going to get a traditional TV announcement or the grand unveiling of an electric car. As such, it\u2019s hard to predict what the Japanese company might wheel out at CES 2023.\nWe do know that Sony\u2019s Vision-S EV will be making an appearance in some form or another \u2013 the company confirmed in a tweet that Sony Honda Mobility will be taking to the stage alongside Sony proper \u2013 but it remains to be seen whether we\u2019ll hear more about the highly-anticipated PlayStation VR 2 headset or much-rumored (though still unconfirmed) PS5 slim console. In all likelihood, Sony will \u2013 at the very least \u2013 lift the lid on a handful of new 4K and 8K displays to drum up excitement for its 2023 TV lineup.\nLG\nLG\u2019s CES track record is more varied than a chocolate selection box. Like Sony, the manufacturer frequently subverts expectations by revealing outlandish products alongside more traditional TV offerings, and we don\u2019t expect CES 2023 to be any different.\nFor instance, we anticipate hearing more about the company\u2019s much-rumored 27-inch OLED gaming monitor, as well as the LG C3 OLED TV \u2013 but the brand\u2019s mind-blowing new stretchable high-res display tech could end up stealing the show if debuted properly. On the appliance side of things, we might also see LG lift the lid on some new washers, dryers, and other home-related products at CES 2023 (a see-through refrigerator has already been confirmed to appear).\nHisense\nHisense will be attending CES 2023, with an exhibit at the LVCC Central Hall (which is a space dedicated to companies focused on gaming, metaverse, XR, and audio/video tech).\nLast year, the brand unveiled a boatload of new TVs across a range of budgets. The highlight was the top-end L9G TriChroma Laser TV, but it also unveiled the Hisense U7H, U8H, and U9H models which were the first Hisense TVs to benefit from mini-LED backlights \u2013 that helped to improve the TV\u2019s contrast capabilities. We were so impressed that, at the time, we speculated that Hisense had just announced the best mid-range TV of 2022 \u2013 with the Hisense U7H being a great companion for the PS5 and Xbox Series X.\nThis year, we expect Hisense will wow us once again with a new batch of impressive displays, and the brand may unveil a soundbar or two, too, to demonstrate the potential of a full-Hisense AV setup. Plus, given its placement among mixed reality tech, we may see Hisense demonstrate some new AR or VR tools, though we aren\u2019t expecting much in this department (if it even has anything to show at all).\nIntel\nIntel will be at CES 2023 with exhibits at the Venetian Expo.\nDuring its appearance at last year\u2019s event, Intel unveiled a new batch of mobile processors \u2013 H-series chips that have appeared in many of the best laptops of 2022 \u2013 including the flagship Core i9-12900HK; this powerful component comes with six performance cores (with hyper-threading) and eight efficiency cores (without hyper-threading), making a total of 14-cores and 20-threads. Intel also took the opportunity to discuss its work in AI and applications like self-driving cars.\nIntel will most likely make CES 2023 the stage for a new load of CPU announcements, including its Intel Raptor Lake line \u2013 a particularly important batch of processors for Intel that will have to prove their worth against the impressive AMD Zen 4 chips.\nAMD\nAccording to the CES 2023 exhibitor directory, AMD might not have a massive presence at the show \u2013 it\u2019s not listed as of December 14, 2022 \u2013 but the brand will at least be giving a keynote presentation, according to a press release.\nJust like Intel, AMD will most likely make CES 2023 the site where it unveils its new mobile CPUs for laptops, as it has done in previous years (consider last year's Ryzen 6000 series reveal, for instance).\nThe AMD Zen 4 line will include the new AMD Ryzen 7000 series chips and, based on leaks, these computing components sound pretty impressive \u2013 so Intel could have quite the competition on its hands.\nNvidia\nIn a repeat of CES 2022, Nvidia doesn\u2019t look likely to have much of a presence on the CES 2023 show floor, but the brand has announced that it will be giving a Special Address on January 3, 2022.\nNvidia hasn\u2019t said what, exactly, will be announced, however, we expect it will unveil the RTX 4070 Ti \u2013 which, according to recent leaks, is set to be a pretty solid GPU. The Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 (launched in October 2022) is more powerful than we thought was possible for a GPU, and while the 4070 Ti is expected to be a step down in terms of performance, it should also be a step down in price \u2013 which is incredible news for our wallets.\nWe could also see some other GPUs make an appearance alongside other announcements, but the big reveal is most likely going to be an RTX 4070.\nOur predictions to CES 2023\nPhones at CES 2023\nIn recent years, the flow of mobile announcements coming from CES has dwindled, with most brands choosing to launch their latest and greatest handsets at dedicated events elsewhere in the calendar instead; just look at the expected February arrival of the Samsung Galaxy S23 range.\nThat said, mobile unveilings from The Strip aren\u2019t completely out of the question this year. Razer has already openly set its sights on the best gaming phones on the market, with the Razer Edge 5G \u2013 first teased at RazerCon 2022. The 5G-capable, Android-powered gaming handheld has been developed in partnership with Verizon, and pricing remains locked behind its CES 2023 appearance.\nTCL has a tendency to serve up a smattering of affordable new Android phones during the show too, and if CES 2022 is anything to go by, we might even see a new Nokia from HMD Global. Those hoping for an affordable successor to 2022\u2019s CES-unveiled Galaxy S21 FE, however, are out of luck.\nTelevisions at CES 2023\nCES 2022 was atypical for TVs, with big names like LG and Sony occupying floor space but choosing not to put products on display. CES 2023 will be a different story, with the big names back in action and once again showing their wares in crowded booths.\nBigger screens are always a hit at CES, but this year we expect the trends to be better and brighter screens. QD-OLED was an incredible new tech introduced in 2022 by Samsung with its S95B and Sony with its XR-A95K, and we expect to see QD-OLED TVs in screen sizes other than the currently available 55 and 65 inches, plus models introduced by other brands.\nThere will be TVs with mini-LED, a backlight tech that delivers enhanced screen brightness and OLED-like blacks, from all brands, and it will appear in more affordable sets like the U8H series Hisense, introduced in 2022.\nMicroLED TVs in 100-inch-plus sizes will be put on display by Samsung and Sony, and prototypes should appear in the booths of a few other TV brands, as well. But we expect prices for these to remain impossibly high for years to come, though getting to check out unobtanium is a big part of CES fun.\nComputing at CES 2023\nAs mentioned above, Nvidia is one of the big players we\u2019re expecting to see at CES. In addition to the expected RTX 4070 Ti, some speculators believe that we\u2019re also going to see the less powerful RTX 4070. Pricing will be critical with these cards, as AMD is currently whipping Nvidia with some very aggressive pricing on its new flagship GPU, the excellent Radeon RX 7900 XTX.\nSpeaking of AMD, we\u2019re expecting big things from Team Red at CES too. CEO Lisa Su will be delivering a keynote speech, and recent leaks have indicated that we might be seeing next-generation 3D V-cache arrive in new Ryzen 7000 CPUs. Elsewhere on the CPU front, some reports have indicated that Intel has plans to reveal a plethora of new 13th-gen chips at the Las Vegas event.\nProcessors and graphics cards aside, plenty of major players in the laptop space will be attending CES, from Dell to Asus to Lenovo. We were privy to recent pre-briefings on Dell and Lenovo's upcoming hardware, and while we can\u2019t share details just yet, it\u2019s safe to say we\u2019re excited for what these manufacturers have in store for 2023.\nAudio at CES 2023\nAll eyes are fixed on a new physical music format, based on vinyl but more like a 12-inch CD disc, as pioneered by Bob Dylan earlier this year. Just kidding \u2013\u00a0although given vinyl\u2019s continued resurgence, we certainly expect to see more innovative ways of playing your burgeoning record collection that doesn\u2019t require multiple boxes and a set of passive speakers cluttering up your den; see Victrola\u2019s Sonos certified deck as a taster. All I needed to get it singing was my Sonos Five wireless speaker and the Victrola companion app on my phone \u2013\u00a0plus of course my stacks of wax.\nIn terms of portable wireless audio, high-resolution (or hi-res) codecs are advancing at a rate of knots, but the SoC (system on chip) hardware they run on is also on the up. Oppo has already gone live with a new chip claiming to bring Bluetooth wireless resolution up to the standards audiophiles might deem acceptable \u2013 and crucially, the chip will fit into earbuds.\nMight we see a few sets of true wireless ANC earbuds built around such a formidable new chip, even in prototype form? It seems highly likely\u2026\u00a0but then, this is Vegas; anything\u2019s possible.\nWearables at CES 2023\nThere are a few big names in health tech at CES this year, but in the smartwatch space, it\u2019s hybrid watches that I reckon will snap up the headlines, or smartwatches that look like traditional analog models with physical hands. Last year, Garmin debuted its Vivomove hybrid range of smartwatches, emphasizing a blend of style and function.\nIt\u2019s since followed it up with the equally handy (get it?) Instinct Crossover, and with Garmin rubbing shoulders with traditional dive watchmakers like Citizen, we expect more hybrid watches to come out of CES 2023 this year. We\u2019ve long bemoaned the fact that smartwatches don\u2019t have a style identity of their own, and people are sick of looking at yet another screen on their wrists. CES, a safe space for brands to play and explore, will show a few more funky hybrid watch designs.\nElsewhere, Philips will be in attendance, so we can expect some new additions to its excellent Sonicare range of the best electric toothbrushes and water flossers, and Renpho parent company Joicom will likely be showing off its latest, whether it\u2019s a new smart scale, massage gun or AI-driven exercise bike to add to its growing health portfolio. Maybe not that last one: after the last few years, we\u2019re all sick of exercising indoors, so expect any exercise innovations to support and encourage outdoor pursuits, (much like Apple Fitness+, which has seen the winds changing and pivoted to content geared towards runners).\nSmart home at CES 2023\nMore connected, better connected. Our homes are set to become a whole lot smarter this year thanks to a new standard: Matter. We attended the official launch in early November in Amsterdam where some new products were announced but the vibe we got is that there is going to be a wave of \u2018new\u2019 at CES. We\u2019ve got all eyes on Nanoleaf, for example. It's set to unveil a number of Matter-compatible products that will help to enable even more seamless lighting automation in the home. This is a truly exciting time for smart homes because (in a nutshell) it means that instead of having multiple apps (Alexa, HomeKit and Siri) to control one device, compatible devices can be controlled by Matter, and Matter only, and all those compatible devices on the network can talk to each other, creating a smart home of our dreams.\nLeaving the (not-so-small) Matter aside, it looks like there is going to be a lot of talk and demos around robot vacuum cleaners with more intelligence and improved performance so you can achieve the automated clean of your dreams. There\u2019s also likely to be the usual crop of smart home devices including home security cameras, video doorbells, and smart locks with better resolutions and smarter AI that can help ensure you\u2019re not plagued by unwanted motion alerts - and unwanted guests in the home.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

Following its adoption in 2016, the CES was expanded in 2020 to meet the requirements of the Climate Act , which sets goals for achieving 70% renewably sourced electricity by 2030 and a zero-emission electric grid by 2040. By focusing on low-carbon energy sources, such as solar, wind, and hydropower, the CES will bring investment, economic development, and jobs to New York State. The CES features two mechanisms \u2013 the renewable energy standard (RES) and zero-emissions credit (ZEC) requirement \u2013 that require every load serving entity\u00a0 to procure renewable energy certificates (RECs) and ZECs. NYSERDA is also advancing large-scale renewable generation through its Offshore Wind and Build-Ready programs.\nLearn More About Large-Scale Renewable Development\nLarge-Scale Renewables\nIssues annual procurements for eligible renewable energy generators and developers interested in long-term Renewable Energy Certificates (REC) contracts.\nRead more about Large-Scale Renewables\nOffshore Wind\nPoised to become a major source of affordable, renewable power for New York.\nRead more about Offshore Wind\nBuild-Ready\nAdvances large-scale renewable energy projects on parking lots and other under-utilized spaces that are made build-ready for private renewable energy developers.\nRead more about Build-Ready\nLSE Obligations\nLearn about the requirements for utilities, electric companies, and other load serving entities (LSEs) to procure renewable energy and help New York meet its clean energy and climate goals.\nRead more about LSE Obligations\nLandowners and Local Governments\nExplore resources to advance responsible clean energy development in your community.\nRead more about Landowners and Local Governments\nClean Energy Standard Resources\nAccess resources, including orders from the Department of Public Service, webinars, and toolkits for local governments and renewable energy developers.\nRead more about Clean Energy Standard Resources\nProgress To Date\nCombined with the existing baseline of renewable facilities in New York, the current pipeline of renewables already under contract and in development projects will power 66% of New York's electricity once operational.\nNew York\u2019s nation-leading climate goals and accelerated renewable energy development are spurring investment, reducing greenhouse emissions, and improving energy efficiency to lower energy demand.\nNew York\u2019s renewable energy transition has brought more than $29 billion in public and private investment. This includes solar, wind (onshore and offshore), and hydro\nprojects and upgrades to transmission infrastructure to deliver clean energy from where it is generated to where it is needed.\nLoad serving entities (LSE) can check their compliance and progress toward the CES 70% by 2030 goal using the New York Generation Attribute Tracking System (NYGATS). NYGATS records and tracks information on electricity generated, imported, and consumed within New York State.\nLSEs that elect to purchase RECs or that are required to purchase ZECs from NYSERDA can find additional information in REC and ZEC Purchasers.\nClean Energy Standard\nNew York\u2019s Clean Energy Standard (CES) is the most comprehensive and ambitious clean energy goal in the State's history.
