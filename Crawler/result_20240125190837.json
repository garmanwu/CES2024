Yet for the 2024 edition, held from January 9 through 12, automakers scaled back their introductions of concept and production cars at the world\u2019s largest tech conference and exhibition, intensifying their focus on the products and services beneath the sheet metal, such as artificial intelligence (AI), connectivity, and software-driven machines. In other words, CES is now as much about what\u2019s driving the vehicle experience as what we\u2019re driving (or in some cases, flying). Here are our highlights.\nHonda 0 Saloon\nThe more captivating of the two concepts unveiled by the monumental Japanese conglomerate Honda, the Saloon gives off wedge-shaped 1970s supercar vibes for the electric era. The Saloon and its boxier counterpart, dubbed the Space Hub, comprise the Honda 0\u00a0Series, which premieres a new design language as well as a new EV platform that will reportedly underpin a production car in 2026.\nA thin lighting signature frames the front end with an illuminated \u201cH\u201d logo in the center. The interior features a yoke-style steering wheel and sustainable materials. While Honda is short on specifics, the company says the production car based on the Saloon will feature next-generation automated driving features as well as connected services and advanced AI that will learn drivers\u2019 behaviors.\nMBUX Virtual Assistant\nMercedes-Benz showed off its MBUX Virtual Assistant, which will run on the marque\u2019s forthcoming, in-house-built MB.OS operating system. The system uses advanced, real-time graphics (powered by the same technology as in video games) and generative AI for a more comprehensive and easier-to-use interface. During a roundtable discussion, which included Robb Report, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s chief technical officer, Markus Sch\u00e4fer, stated that \u201cthe car is no longer a car. It\u2019s about creating a new relationship to your vehicle.\u201d\nSoon to be expected with the new MB.OS will be productivity apps such as Zoom, as well as entertainment options like Angry Birds. Unlike BMW, which will charge customers extra for its connected content, Mercedes currently has no plans to institute a subscription model, at least according to Sch\u00e4fer.\nMBUX Sound Drive\nIn other Mercedes news, Mercedes-AMG launched Sound Drive. The app, created with help from Will.i.am, is triggered by driver inputs such as throttle, steering, and brake. On a test drive with the musician, we heard a handful of specific songs\u2014modified especially for the feature\u2014respond to our throttle with a digital revving sound complemented with multi-dimensional flourishes when we turned the wheel.\nIt\u2019s a creative way to capitalize on the quiet cabin afforded by electric cars, replacing the soundtrack of a combustion engine with enhanced music. The feature will be available on Mercedes-Benz and Mercedes-AMG production models equipped with the new MB.OS.\nVolkswagen\u2019s Voice-Activated Digital Assistant\nVolkswagen debuted a new version of its voice-activated digital assistant, which is powered by Chat GPT. The result is touted to be enhanced functionality and more natural language recognition. During a demo, we heard the new assistant suggest nearby restaurants, answer questions about the chairman of a competing car company, and create a bedtime story.\nThe latest system is slated to appear on VW\u2019s electric cars (ID.7, ID.4, ID.5, and ID.3), as well as the new Tiguan and Passat, in the second quarter of this year. Currently, the technology has only been confirmed for VW models, but we suspect similar tech might expand to the Volkswagen Group\u2019s luxury nameplates such as Audi, Bentley, Porsche, and possibly even Lamborghini.\nQualcomm\u2019s Concept Car\nWhile Qualcomm isn\u2019t making cars itself, the tech giant is a crucial supplier to some of the world\u2019s biggest automakers, including BMW, Mercedes, and Jaguar Land Rover, enabling features like in-car connectivity, telematics, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The many non-automotive partners for Qualcomm\u2019s products and connected solutions include Amazon Music, Bose, and TikTok.\nAt CES, Qualcomm\u2019s concept car showcased the company\u2019s AI-powered voice assistant and other connectivity features built on its Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit platform. Also announced was its Snapdragon Satellite, which will bring satellite-based, two-way messaging to next-generation Android phones. The collaboration with navigation-specialist Garmin will enable emergency messaging when a cell signal isn\u2019t available.\nBMW\u2019s Remote Valet\nBMW showed off its Remote Valet self-parking feature, which enables cars to search for spaces and park themselves autonomously in areas equipped to support the technology. Alternatively, drivers are able to park from outside the vehicle via their mobile devices. BMW also debuted its 9.0 operating system with an updated version of its voice assistant that uses Amazon\u2019s Alexa Large Language Model. And a new video app will allow for live TV and on-demand streaming.\nOther features, available through BMW\u2019s Digital Premium subscription service, include console-style, two-player gaming and a variety of other third-party apps. It\u2019s an interesting litmus test as to whether customers are ready to pay for digital content, as BMW backpedaled on its subscription fee for Apple CarPlay a few years ago.\nSupernal S-A2 eVTOL\nA Hyundai subsidiary based in Northern California\u2019s Silicon Valley, Supernal unveiled the S-A2 eVTOL designed for city operations. The zero-emissions flying machine has a purported range of 25 to 40 miles. Designed by the Genesis studio, based in Irvine, Calif., the S-A2 features reverse-opening butterfly doors, ubiquitous glass, and lime-green ambient lighting.\nHyundai and its subsidiaries have been bullish on expanding their products and services, also showing a gargantuan automated tractor, as well as the now-familiar robot dogs from Hyundai-acquired Boston Dynamics. \u201cWe have evolved from being a car company into a mobility company,\u201d stated Hyundai CEO Jay Chang at the S-A2\u2019s reveal. Judging by the 2024 CES, that\u2019s a transition many presenters can now claim.\nRead More On:\nMore Cars\nInside the World\u2019s Biggest Mercedes Collection\nThis Bonkers 1969 Shelby GT350 With a Wild History Is Headed to Auction\nApple\u2019s\u00a0Not-So-Self-Driving Car Is Delayed Again: Report\nLamborghini\u2019s Newest Tech Concept Uses AI to Coach You on the Track\nElevate Your Inbox\nNewsletters curated for the connoisseur.\nGive the Gift of Luxury\nLatest Galleries in Cars\nMore From Our Brands\nRobb Report\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nLegal\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nSubscribe/Purchase\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nSubscriber Services\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nConnect\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret"

From designing the look and feel of the system, to engineering apps that users will experience every day, to defining the core services that all applications utilize, Valtech Mobility\u2019s AOSP Team works with OEMs to build infotainment systems that will delight users.\nYou can\u2019t offer end-to-end mobility service without a strong focus on safety. The Valtech Mobility Safety Team believes that precompetitive software and standards are necessary for safer roads. Our team brings collective experience to ongoing standardization efforts and technology development aimed at protecting the most vulnerable road users. All aspects of the mobility sector are changing, and Valtech Mobility is ready to help established brands as well as new upstarts meet the changing landscape.\nConnecting experiences inside and outside the vehicle\nWe enable the world\u2019s best-known brands to reimagine the end-to-end customer journey from purchase to in-car experience. Together, we're working with car makers like Volkswagen, BMW, AUDI and Toyota, to transform everything from the connected product to the complete digital customer experience.\nWe're delivering connected services platforms, new dealership experiences, purchasing solutions and unique online sale options, and helping them to find new ways to better integrate with smart cities and the world around them. With our user-focused design and implementation methodology, we\u2019re helping OEMs define the future of the connected vehicle and beyond.\nVolkswagen Group and Valtech GmbH have been collaborating in the field of connected vehicles since 2009, leading to the creation of Valtech Mobility, a joint venture between Volkswagen Group and Valtech. Our goal is to supply innovative solutions that are well thought out to the very last detail while offering a defined added value and can be operated intuitively.\n\"Our ability to offer a true 360\u00b0 experience, both in-car and out-of-car, gives us a very unique position in the market. We have the relevant experience within mobility but can also tap into and bring together experiences from other sectors such as retail and luxury. This makes us the ideal bridge between our mobility clients, technology partners and big tech.\u201d Peter Ivanov, Managing Director, Mobility Global.\nBeyond the purchase\nDelivering digital information and answering FAQs is one thing, but the truth is that the process of buying a car is also changing to suit our digital-first world. Helping to update the way customers buy cars is part of our DNA. Whether it\u2019s the process of choosing or creating the right car, or help with financing, we\u2019ve got it covered.\nWhen BMW was looking to create a more seamless experience for customers to find BMW stock cars, we helped them take that project to the next level by creating a new car configurator. The result is a unique\u00a0car matchmaking system\u00a0that perfectly matches the customer with the perfect car from BMW\u2019s fleet of options.\nWhen Toyota was looking to test out whether buying a car online was something their customers would be interested in, they partnered with Valtech to build the platform that would facilitate that. Now,\u00a0Toyota Financial Services can finance a car purchase\u00a0without the customer needing to visit a dealership.\nHaving worked with such industry giants on projects that touch on each important aspect of the customer experience journey led us down the path towards creating an entire business focused on one specific vertical.\nA successful automotive future requires a digital partner\nWhether you\u2019re looking to enhance the UX/UI, IOT integration, or autonomous capabilities of your vehicles, update the way customers find, customize and purchase vehicles online, or even break into the MaaS offering, you\u2019ll need a strong digital partner to help you realize your future automotive needs. It\u2019s best if that partner already knows enough about the automotive production and customer buying journey so that they can come to you ready with proven ideas on how to achieve your goals.\nOur experience with the biggest names in the industry, our research into automotive customer needs, as well as our work on the challenges that so many automotive companies and OEMs are facing all speak for themselves.\nWe\u2019re helping mobility clients to design, build and drive the future of mobility.

        "raw_content": "OverviewContact us\nOn these pages we present information about our products and innovations\nOverviewContact\nOverviewContact us\nOverviewContact us\nOverviewContact Us\nThe Future is Now: Continental Innovates Mobility from the Road to the Cloud at CES\u00ae 2024\nAUBURN HILLS, Mich., December 19, 2023 \u2013 At CES 2024 in Las Vegas, technology company Continental will demonstrate its vision for future mobility. In a brand-new location, within Central Plaza (CP-25 and CP-26), Continental is showcasing advancements with its latest partnerships, award-winning displays and driving solutions aimed at making roadways safer. Visitors to the company\u2019s private exhibit will experience Continental\u2019s latest advancements in software-driven mobility. Additionally, Continental will demonstrate, along with several of its strategic partners, its vision for the future of mobility.\n\u201cWe are advancing technology solutions for the new era of mobility,\u201d said Aruna Anand, President and CEO, Continental Automotive, North America. \u201cContinental has an impact on almost every aspect of the vehicle. By leveraging our expertise in software-driven mobility, we are shaping the future of mobility. At CES 2024, we\u2019ll demonstrate how we\u2019re making mobility safer, exciting, and autonomous.\u201d\nBuilding a new space within the vehicle\nAs the car becomes an essential integrated space to interact with all aspects of personal and professional life, the user experience becomes a key factor for car buyers. Continental will demonstrate innovations that enable a novel and creative user experience.\nDuring CES 2024, exciting, intuitive, and award-winning user displays will be front and center for Continental. Showcased for the first time, the Crystal Center Display demonstrates the next generation of technology and highlights innovative design possibilities while matching the trend for luxury appearance. For a more subtle effect, the Curved In2visible Display integrates seamlessly into the cockpit enabling new design possibilities and turning a vehicle into a living room on wheels.\nAs vehicles integrate more software and take on functions like computers and smartphones, they must also become more secure. Continental has considered this with its Face Authentication Displays. These are the highest security standards for smooth car entry and safe vehicle start. The \u201cliveness check\u201d ensures only the driver, or those registered to the vehicle\u2019s profile, can secure access.\nIncreasing mobile computing power\nIn addition to becoming more automated, vehicle technology is increasingly more connected. Connected vehicles make driving safer and more convenient. To support such new functions, cars have become computers on wheels. Software-defined vehicles and connected mobility require more intelligence and computing power, but current vehicle architectures are reaching their limits. Continental\u2019s Smart Cockpit High-Performance Computer (HPC), in collaboration with Google Cloud, demonstrates how the Smart Cockpit HPC enables the mobility experience of the future. Together, the two companies are equipping cars with generative Artificial Intelligence (AI), making Continental one of the first automotive suppliers to integrate Google Cloud capabilities directly into vehicle computers. With this, drivers can interact with their car in a natural dialogue. Whether drivers need help finding the right tire pressure when the car is fully loaded or want to know more about local places of interest at their destination or along the route when they are on vacation, the generative AI can compile the required information and answer the drivers\u2019 questions.\nDeveloping the future of driverless transportation\nThe Radar Vision Parking solution, named a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree, enables Level 3 and Level 4 driving and parking functions of software-defined vehicles. By combining high-resolution surround radars with high-resolution cameras, Continental enables parking use cases that require very precise and close-range measurement around the vehicle. Early parking slot detection, for example, lets users park in a single stroke without driving past the spot.\nVisitors will also experience the power of partnerships with Aurora Innovation's autonomous technology. In this first-of-its-kind partnership, Continental is responsible for industrializing the autonomous driving system kits which will leverage a wide spectrum of Continental\u2019s extensive automotive product portfolio from sensors, automated driving control units (ADCU), high performance computers (HPC), telematics units and more, to the complete fallback system which covers the full chain of effects. Continental will integrate these hardware components into pods which will be supplied to Aurora\u2019s vehicle manufacturing partners. This will advance the product offering for autonomous trucking customers.\nAlso on display will be the Full Stack Automated Driving Solution with Ambarella. Continental contributes the hardware and large parts of the software to this partnership, while Ambarella provides the System-on-Chip (SoC) platform and further software functionalities. Compared to other domain controller SoCs, Ambarella\u2019s \u201cCV3-AD\u201d chip family provides higher performance to process sensor data faster and more comprehensively for greater environmental perception and safer mobility, at up to five times higher power efficiency. As a result of this strategic partnership, the next generation of vehicles, ranging from L2+ to the highest automation levels, will be able to utilize the powerful, energy-efficient, and scalable mobility system solutions from Continental and Ambarella.\nContinental at CES 2024\nContinental will showcase its latest technologies at a private structure exhibit in Central Plaza across from the Las Vegas Convention Center from Tuesday, January 9 through Friday, January 12. The technology company has numerous solutions that highlight mobility innovations, from the road to the cloud. An invitation-only media event has been scheduled for January 9. Please contact Christina Clarke for details.\nFollow Continental CES 2024 highlights on Facebook, Instagram, and X: #ContinentalCES\nShare:\nMary Arraf\nHead of Communications Automotive and Continental North America\nChristina Clarke\nCommunications Specialist, Automotive"
