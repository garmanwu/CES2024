AIMA unveiled its new eMoped, the emoped-HYHAWK. Designed with a cyber-digital style and a futuristic look, the emoped-HYHAWK aims to spark a global trend in electric moped, fulfilling the dreams of young enthusiasts aspiring for the freedom of the open road.\nSafe and Stable, AIMA's emoped-HYHAWK Leads a New Trend in Electric Moped\nWho doesn't love riding a motorcycle? But traditional motorcycles come with strict age requirements and need specialized training.\nAIMA Technology Group, a globally renowned e-mobility brand, has introduced the emoped-HYHAWK, a new model designed to fulfill a motorcycle dream. Tailored for new riders, the\u00a0emoped-HYHAWK offers easy handling and can be ridden by beginners, ensuring rider safety. The emoped-HYHAWK makes the dream of riding freely on the open road accessible to everyone.\nCyber-Tech Aesthetics, Winner of the U.S. MUSE Design Gold Award\nThe design of AIMA's emoped-HYHAWK embodies a pioneering spirit of innovation on a global scale. Its mech and cyber-tech styling is evident in every detail. With a black body accented by fluorescent colors and sleek, robust lines, it presents a futuristic eMoped design. Features like a compact frame, X-shaped headlights, floating seat, and hidden cyber-style digital display enhance its tech appeal. The emoped's colorful ambient lighting caters to young riders' imagination for night rides.\nWinning the U.S. MUSE Design Gold Award, the emoped-HYHAWK reaffirms AIMA's leadership in fashionable product design.\nExceptional Performance, Mastering Diverse Riding Terrains\nAIMA's emoped-HYHAWK isn't just about looks; performance is also a key strength.

This makes it easy for young riders to confidently handle different landscapes.\nThe front and rear perforated disc brakes ensure strong braking power at high speeds. Additionally, the safety feature of an automatic power-off when parked with the sensor-equipped side stand enhances parking safety.\nInnovative Design, Creating a Enjoyable Riding Experience\nThe emoped-HYHAWK by AIMA, designed with ergonomic principles, offers a golden ratio for rider comfort, blending the riding triangles of street and cruiser bikes for an enjoyable riding experience, especially for new riders.

The compact size and superior manoeuvrability enable even novice riders to master advanced riding techniques, like leaning into turns, for a thrilling ride.\nIndustry-Changing eBike Innovation: Santa Monica\nAIMA's new ebike Santa Monica, which will be launched in April, also made its debut at the launch event. Inspired by the western end of Route 66 in Santa Monica, this new model features the innovative Route 66 motor developed by Bafang Electric for Aima eBike - a powerful yet lightweight 750W city bike motor. Unique for its 73nm torque, this motor has been meticulously designed for enhanced cooling, operational efficiency, and quick start-up, standing out in its class. Equipped with high-performance SR Suntour suspension fork, Tektro's Hydraulic Disc Brake, and a sensitive Torque sensor, the Santa Monica promises to offer riders a liberating urban cruise, capturing the essence of coastal breezes and the historic Route 66.\nAIMA continues to push the boundaries with innovative designs and trendy concepts, enriching the two-wheeler electric riding lifestyle.

We may get paid if you buy something or take an action after clicking one of these.\nThe Electric Bikes at CES: All The New E-Bikes on Display\nCarbon Fiber Frames, Integrated Displays, Glossy Paint, and LEDS Galore!\nOur time at the show was limited, but we still managed to see a host of new e-bike models, speak with brands both new and old, and of course, squeeze in a ride. Follow along as we cover some of the latest developments in e-bike technology we saw at CES in Las Vegas!\nHimiway: A Revamped Lineup with a Carbon Fiber Crown Jewel\nPerhaps one of the most unexpected surprises of the show was Himiway\u2019s expansive booth which was brimming with glossy new e-bikes \u2013 some fresh and some familiar. The brand has completely revamped their line of e-bikes with new models, polished aesthetics, upgraded components, and naming conventions which group the bikes by their intended purpose.\nThe rebranded D series of e-bikes, for example, are sportier off-road capable models that are refreshed versions of the old Cobra and Zebra. The D7 Pro, which replaces the Cobra Pro, features upgraded components including a 4-piston brake system, a Shimano CUES drivetrain, a dual-crown inverted suspension fork with 220mm of travel, and a dropper seatpost.\nThe new C line is intended to be family oriented with both child- and adult-sized versions of a new moto/moped-style design. The smaller C1 (pictured below) uses a 350W rear-hub motor and is limited to 15 mph, while the full-size C5 (above) features a 750W motor and a Class 2 limit of 20 mph.\nSide note: while we look forward to testing and reviewing the full-size C5, we are currently working on a review of the C1 kids e-bike. The picture above provides a good indication of what our 6-year old tester, AJ, thinks about it!\nA new cargo/utility bike dubbed the C3 features a long step-thru frame, a 350-lb carrying capacity, and a custom wedge-style saddle. Like the C5, it hosts a 750W motor and 960 Wh battery for extended range capability.\nPerhaps the most visually stunning, however, were the X5 Pro and X5 Ultra carbon-fiber eMTBs. While both tiers of the brand\u2019s new enduro bike will only be available in a single frame size, they will be offered in full-suspension, hardtail, and fat tire variants.\nThe premium X5 Ultra will be equipped with a host of impressive components including a SRAM Eagle drivetrain, a Rockshox BoXXer suspension fork, a Rockshox wireless electronic dropper post, a clean top-tube-integrated display, a tubeless tire setup with carbon rims, and a 500W Bafang M600 mid-drive motor.\nReminiscent of the Rambler, the A7 Pro rounds out the brand\u2019s new lineup. This full-suspension commuter includes a quick-adjust seatpost, a 500W mid-drive, and a display integrated into its adjustable stem.\nUrtopia: Dashing Into the Future with Polished Designs and ChatGPT Integration\nWith all the recent buzz around AI in general and ChatGPT in particular, we were highly intrigued by the idea of integrating such functionality into an e-bike. In addition to offering stylish, futuristic designs for their three unique e-bikes, Urtopia grabbed our attention by being the first to do so.\nThe brand\u2019s flashy carbon fiber flagship, the Carbon Pro 1, features an unexpected design with a seamless, floating top tube/seat tube/seat stay element. The bike houses a 4G eSIM card that allows it to track the bike\u2019s location for phone-free navigation and security, play music through an integrated bluetooth speaker, and connect to ChatGPT.\nOur contact said that the GPT integration can do such things as helping riders set up custom routes, find the nearest coffee shop, or simply ask about the weather forecast. Our personal experiences with ChatGPT lead us to question the reliability of its information (at least in the technology\u2019s current state), but we hope to be able to test the Carbon Pro 1 for ourselves in the near future!\nUtopia also offers a more entry-level \u2013 but still impressively feature-saturated \u2013 alloy-frame city/commuter called the Chord. While it does not integrate with ChatGPT, this e-bike still offers navigation, music, etc. and pairs with the Urtopia app. The bike uses a 350W rear-hub motor with a torque sensor paired with a 353 Wh battery.\nA currently unreleased model, the Fusion, features a carbon fiber step-thru frame, dual 350W front and rear hub motors, and dual batteries (one main and one auxiliary/range extender) with a total of 860 Wh and a max range of 120 miles.\nA second version of the Fusion was offered for European cyclists; in addition to a flashier paint job, this model featured a 250W Bafang mid-drive motor that will not (currently) be available in the US.\nVanpowers: Affordable Adventure Bikes with Integrated Security Tech\nAfter being pleasantly surprised during our review of the UrbanGlide Ultra, we were excited to see the latest developments from Vanpowers. With two new offerings including a carbon fiber gravel bike and a beefy fat tire touring bike, the brand is clearly interested in diversifying their lineup and proving their competence in off-road environments.\nThe Ultra version of the fat tire GrandTeton features a 500W Bafang mid-drive and 692 Wh battery, while the more budget-friendly Pro version uses a rear-hub motor. Both have a \u201csmart box\u201d integrated into the top tube with 4G and GPS functionality for navigation and theft protection, but also an SOS feature that can alert a pre-selected contact in the event of a hard impact.\nThe 39-lb UrbanCross also features the smart hub, and is available in an Ultra version with 46cm flared drop bars or a Pro version with flat bars; both will be offered in three frame sizes. Regardless of tier, the bike uses a 250W rear hub motor with a torque sensor, a 345.6 Wh battery, a stem-integrated display, and Bluetooth connectivity with the Vanpowers app.\nHeybike: Taking a Chance with Crowdfunded Carbon Fiber\nHeybike made an appearance with three new models, including a full-suspension version of the Ranger S called the Horizon, a cargo e-bike called the Hauler, and a full-suspension, carbon fiber fat tire bike called the Hero.\nWhile details were scarce, the Hero was the star of the show with its unique step-thru frame and flashy orange-and-grey paint job. The bike uses custom carbon fiber handlebars with an integrated display, and is set to be crowdfunded through an indiegogo campaign later this spring.\nOkai: Clean Design and LEDs Are the Future of Commuting\nAs a relative newcomer to the e-bike market, Okai was a behind-the-scenes manufacturer for prominent e-bike and e-scooter brands such as Bird and Lime. Okai launched three new commuter-focused e-bike models after a year of development, all with tech at the forefront.\nThe EB60, also referred to as the Traverse, puts a huge focus on minimalistic design. The bike features an LED light bar that stretches across the full length of the handlebars for visibility, but its color and pattern can be customized to suit the rider through the Okai app. The bike uses a 350W rear hub motor with a torque sensor and an integrated 345.6 Wh battery.\nWe were impressed by the 440 lb weight capacity of the brand\u2019s utility e-bike called the EB70. Another step-thru commuter called the EB80 uses an integrated battery with LED light bars that change color to reflect battery charge.\nLooking Ahead: Design Trends for 2024\nA clean and streamlined aesthetic seems to be the new norm, with brands opting for weld-free carbon fiber frames, fully integrated batteries, seamlessly integrated displays, and automotive-quality paint jobs.\nWe can\u2019t wait to get our hands on some of these models for an even more detailed look!\nReader Interactions\nComments\nJohn Holmes says\nJanuary 16, 2024 at 11:50 am\nNo mention of the Fuell Flluid? It was (supposedly) at the Valeo booth.\nJohn S. Bozick says\nJanuary 16, 2024 at 2:50 pm\nWe really wanted to get over there to see that one, but unfortunately our time was limited! Hopefully we\u2019ll be able to stay longer next year.\nJohn Holmes says\nJanuary 17, 2024 at 12:02 pm\nThanks for at least wanting to. As you may or may not have noticed there isn\u2019t a single mention anywhere online from anyone not named Fuell or Valeo that talked about it. Nothing Google knows about, nothing on YouTube, and nothing on Instagram.\nJohn S. Bozick says\nJanuary 18, 2024 at 9:21 am\nThat\u2019s surprising, but also not. The e-bike booths were kind of scattered, so it\u2019s possible many outlets didn\u2019t even know Fuell had a presence.\nGroucho says\nJanuary 16, 2024 at 11:30 pm\nThe Himiway C3 looks interesting. Similar to the Gazelle Easyflow, but without the comfortable bars. Cannot say about the riding position without riding it.\nJohn S. Bozick says\nJanuary 17, 2024 at 10:10 am\nAgreed! We\u2019re curious about the saddle, too.\nDaniel Dickman says\nJanuary 17, 2024 at 1:57 pm\nThe future is here,Baby!!! Enjoy!!!\nJaimee says\nJanuary 18, 2024 at 10:35 pm\nI\u2019m kind of (pleasantly) surprised that the trend isn\u2019t toward ever more powerful motors. Apparently a 750w motor isn\u2019t the new baseline; maybe we\u2019ll see the throttle disappear on some models, too.\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

With its outstanding cross-riding design and youth-oriented concept, HYHAWK captured the attention of international markets and professional media.\nTailored for young people and students, this eMoped is designed as their first foray into cross-riding products.

AIMA Debuts at CES, Launching a New Chapter in Global Strategy\nLAS VEGAS, Jan. 15, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- From January 9-12, 2024, the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was held at the Las Vegas Convention Center. This event, established in 1967, has grown into one of the world's largest, most prestigious, and influential consumer electronics exhibitions. AIMA made its debut at this year's show, hosting its first-ever global product launch. Presenting an international brand image, AIMA took to the global stage, competing alongside over 4,000 global consumer brands.\nLeveraging its debut at CES, AIMA unveiled its global strategy centered on 'brand globalization,' showcasing the success of its localized brand operations in the U.S., launching the latest eMoped model, HYHAWK, and the new eBike, Santa Monica. Additionally, AIMA officially announced its deep collaboration with Bafang Electric in the eBike sector. This comprehensive strategic layout fully demonstrates AIMA's ambition and determination to powerfully penetrate the U.S. and global markets.\nBringing a Fashionable Riding Experience to All American UsersAIMA's CES Debut Accelerates Its Global Development Journey\nDistinguished from typical industry expos, the U.S. CES gathers a broad array of companies, including leading traditional consumer electronics and core IT manufacturers from around the world. Known for advanced products and technological concepts, and strong professionalism with effective foreign trade outcomes, CES offers a unique platform. AIMA's first global product launch here garnered extensive attention, showcasing Chinese innovation in style and technology to an audience exceeding 130,000 people worldwide. This visibility not only highlighted AIMA's fashionable appeal but also opened new trade opportunities with numerous overseas manufacturers.\nAt the CES, AIMA's booth was a hive of activity, showcasing not only the new emoped-HYHAWK and eBike Santa Monica but also its classic models like the AIMA Dandan series and Tiger Saber, all popular in international markets. The exquisite product designs received unanimous acclaim from exhibitors and visitors alike, attracting throngs of attendees and underlining AIMA Technology's comprehensive strength and global market influence as a leading brand in the electric two-wheeler sector.\nThis global tech extravaganza saw many renowned Chinese manufacturers shine, with over 1,100 exhibitors, and Chinese companies making up more than a quarter of the total.

Attention to detail is evident in its hidden embedded instrument panel with dynamic lighting animations that accurately display battery life and time. The digital dot-matrix headlights and seven-color ambient lighting add a digital tech feel, making night rides cooler and more exciting.\nAs a youthful urban eMoped, the emoped-HYHAWK also excels in performance features. It's equipped with a large graphene battery for extended range.

The eMoped includes front and rear perforated dual disc brakes and hydraulic shock absorbers for easy riding on various terrains.\nAnother new AIMA product, the Santa Monica e-bike, is tailored for overseas markets, inspired by the lifestyle of American coastal cities and the iconic Route 66.

AIMA's global strategy starts anew, promising all global users a high-quality mobility experience courtesy of AIMA.\nGlobal Strategy AdvancementAIMA Leads the Charge in Creating a World-Class Electric Vehicle Brand from China\nAt the start of 2024, AIMA's first global press conference at the CES in the USA was a significant strategic milestone. Luo Jiangang, the General Manager of International Business at AIMA Technology Group, officially unveiled AIMA's new global strategy - focusing on OBM business for brand globalization.
