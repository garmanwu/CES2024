        "raw_content": "The Pebble Flow is an all-electric trailer for the EV age\nOn view at CES 2024, it packs a 45 kWH LFP battery, a 1kW solar panel and even an optional motor for self propulsion.\nWith the transition to electric vehicles, the way we travel needs to change too. And at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, the Pebble Flow is providing a glimpse at how an RV designed for the EV age should function.\nThe 25 feet long Pebble Flow is designed for a family of four. Interior space stands at about 150 square-feet though, unlike some of its competitors, there aren\u2019t any pop-out sections to expand its dimensions. Powering the whole thing is a 45 kWh LFP battery and a 1kW solar panel that provide enough juice to keep the RV running for about a week. And in addition to having support for up to Level 3 DC fast charging (with a 0 to 80 percent charge taking about an hour), the Pebble Flow also offers vehicle-to-load functionality, allowing you to power other devices, recharge an EV, or even keep the lights on in your home during an outage.\nWhat might be even more impressive is that, if you opt for its optional dual motor Magic Pack, the Pebble Flow turns into a self-propelled RV that can self park and even automatically hitch itself, thanks to some help from its NVIDIA Drive Orin SoC. The propulsion part is kind of a big deal because, depending on the load, towing something with an EV has a massive impact on range. You could go from a typical range for an EV of 250 to 300 miles down to just 100 miles or less. But with the Pebble Flow\u2019s dual motor, there\u2019s a much less severe drop that could allow for trips of up to 200 miles or more before needing to recharge.\nOn the inside, the Pebble Flow offers a comfortable, contemporary almost Scandinavian design. Plus there\u2019s a handful of techy features that I really appreciate. Right inside the door is a detachable tablet that serves as the control center for the entire RV. You can turn lights on or off, lock the doors, adjust temperature or even activate Pebble\u2019s Magic Hitch feature. To ensure more complicated functions don\u2019t get activated by accident, you\u2019ll need to input a password or biometrics first.\nThe all-electric Pebble Flow RV\nIn person photos of the Pebble Flow from CES 2024.\nFrom there you move into the Pebble Flow\u2019s dining room which features a wraparound couch and table with more than enough room for four. And at night, the table can be lowered, covered with nearby cushions and converted into a bed. Next there\u2019s the kitchen which is surprisingly large for an RV this size. Instead of a gas range, the Pebble Flow has two induction burners that can even be removed if you feel like cooking outside. Meanwhile, the faucet can spin 180-degree so you can wash up from outside. There\u2019s also a large fridge and a 4-in-1 microwave/oven/toaster/air fryer built into the wall.\nBut the Pebble Flow\u2019s coolest feature is almost certainly the glass separating its bathroom from the rest of the cabin. Normally, it\u2019s transparent to help preserve a sense of roominess. However, at the touch of a button, the electrochromic glass becomes completely opaque so you can handle your business in private. And smartly, the button to make it go clear or frosted is the only thing in the RV you can\u2019t control from the tablet or the RV\u2019s mobile app. After all, the last thing you want is a toddler touching the wrong thing and putting your whole ass on display for guests.\nFinally, in back there\u2019s a queen-size Murphy bed that can transform into a shared working space in just a few seconds. It\u2019s a nice space saving feature which the company says can help the Pebble Flow potentially pull double duty as an office space or ADU (accessory dwelling unit) when it\u2019s parked at home.\nThere isn\u2019t a single feature or component that\u2019s really revolutionary. Instead, it\u2019s how everything works together, from controlling its lights via its tablet and mobile app, to having a sizable 45 kWh battery for powering the RV, appliances or anything else you might have. And when paired with an electric tow vehicle, the Pebble Flow helps preserve your EV\u2019s range while making it super simple to park and hitch. It\u2019s not an RV reinvented, just one that\u2019s been optimized for the age of EVs.\nThe Pebble Flow starts at $109,000 or $125,000 when equipped with the company\u2019s dual motor Magic Pack. Pre-orders are already live with Pebble expecting to begin deliveries before the end of the year."

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: An Inside Tour of the Pebble Flow\nBack in October, Pebble unveiled its all-electric flagship trailer: the Pebble Flow. Featuring an active propulsion assist system and renewable energy capacity, we got the opportunity to check it out at the Pebble booth at CES 2024. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nfuturizing camping\nThe Pebble Flow definitely turns heads and it screams modernernlistic simplicity both inside and out. With a length of 25 feet and height of 8\u20198, I can see the Pebble Flow comfortably housing a couple or small family for a camping trip. When you walk into the RV, you\u2019re immediately greeted with a clean white interior with woodsy accents and some dark tones. At 150 square feet of space inside, the Pebble Flow feels deceptively roomy. Once you get to know it better, you appreciate its function-first design and how integrated it is. The panoramic windows feel inviting and open out from the chef\u2019s kitchen. There\u2019s a removable indoor/outdoor induction range, a full-size fridge, and also a microwave oven. The faucet even opens out through the windows so if you\u2019re cooking outside and need to fill up a pot or need water, there\u2019s easy access.\nWhile small in size, the Pebble Flow\u2019s bathroom is also equally thoughtful. The shower glass (and exterior panoramic windows facing the kitchen) can be controlled to adjust for privacy with the touch of a button. There\u2019s LED lighting and plenty of storage here for multiple people. Other notable features include the soft-touch cabinetry across the entire RV, a Scandinavian looking living room that\u2019s multifunctional as well (turns into a full size bed), and even the dog bowls that are cleverly tucked away at the entryway.\nOf course, the Pebble Flow is designed for nomads and that\u2019s the highlight of the bedroom. Featuring a Queen size murphy bed, the bed can be converted to a desk easily when not in use. There\u2019s USB-C outlets and Starlink connectivity for internet to keep the camper in touch with the civilized world.\nProduct Specs +\nSpecs\nElectricity\nstaying connected\nThe Pebble Flow can be controlled through its app and tablet that is conveniently placed at the entryway of the RV. Control everything from lighting, windows, as well as change modes and more all through the app. Owners can even control the Pebble Flow through the app to position and park the RV. Pebble says it will continue to modernize the Pebble Flow through OTA updates.\nplenty of Smarts\nThere\u2019s a ton of features the Pebble Flow can do, including a camp mode called InstaCamp where the Pebble Flow can adjust its lights, temperature and pitch the awning so that users don\u2019t have to manually set up. It is even able to hitch itself through sensors.\nenergy-oriented\nThe Pebble Flow houses a 45 kWH LFP battery, with Pebble saying users can stay off-grid for up to 7 days. There\u2019s also integrated solar to help the Pebble Flow sustain itself. Finally, the Pebble Flow includes AC/DC charging through a 240V output so you can charge conveniently on the go. It even has an emergency energy backup in case homeowners are faced with an outage or need backup.\nUsing the Pebble Flow\u2019s dual-motor Active Propulsion Assist System, you can tow the Pebble Flow with a gas or EV vehicle so long as your vehicle has a towing capacity of 6,200 lbs. This is where the Pebble Flow shines as it isn\u2019t a dead weight trailer that needs to be lugged around. The Flow takes a lot of the burden off of the car towing it. Our first look at the Pebble Flow was a short one, but we\u2019re excited to see these on the road. Preorders are available for the Pebble Flow at a starting price of $109,000. They are expected to ship by the end of 2024.\nLida\nAlways the number cruncher, the former narrative journalist turned data scientist, can\u2019t help but find herself bursting with excitement with each new generation of tech gadgets. After all, predicting future trends is Lida\u2019s forte. Any gadget that survives Lida\u2019s torturous, adult working woman itinerary of over 700 notifications a day deserves praise!\nAI was the single biggest talking point at CES 2024, with every company delivering some sort of advancement of artificial intelligence into their products. After a strong showing of AI advancements on their lifestyle products at the show, Samsung is now ready to introduce AI into their smartphone division with the newly announced Galaxy S24 series. In fact, the tagline of the unveiling was \u201cGalaxy AI is here\u201d and boy is there a lot to unpack.\nIt\u2019s a new year and that means it is time for a refresh of products from Xiaomi\u2019s budget brand, Redmi. The Chinese giant announced the new lineup of Redmi Note 13 phones for the 2024 calendar year that includes the standard Note 13, the Note 13 5G, the Note 13 Pro, the Note 13 Pro 5G, and the Note 13 Pro+ 5G. Always the provider of quality value, Redmi has a product for just about every customer in varying price ranges.\nAt their gigantic CES 2024 booth, we were shocked to see a Nio ES8 on display surrounded by augmented reality glasses. This Chinese EV SUV is a rare sight on American soil as it is currently only sold in China and certain European countries.\nAt Razer\u2019s booth during CES 2024, the center attraction piece was none other than the upcoming refreshed, Razer Blade 18 laptop. This beauty has Razer\u2019s largest screen size available and will get a bit of a resolution bump in a tradeoff with the refresh rate numbers.\nBack in October, Pebble unveiled its all-electric flagship trailer: the Pebble Flow. Featuring an active propulsion assist system and renewable energy capacity, we got the opportunity to check it out at the Pebble booth at CES 2024. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nWearables and AI were two of the most common themes at CES 2024, but what happens when you bring them together? We got to take a closer look at the RingConn Smart Ring at CES Unveiled.\nAs dog owners, we take their safety and well being very seriously. That\u2019s why we were highly intriqued when we came across Invoxia\u2019s Minitailz tracker for pets at CES 2024 Unveiled. We spoke briefly with the company to learn more about the self-proclaimed \u201cmost advanced health and GPS tracker for dogs\u201d in order to get a better understanding of what makes this a potentially revolutionary pet product.\nThis year at CES 2024, Shift Robotics provided demonstrations of their Moonwalker shoes. The Moonwalkers are designed for people to travel at running speeds simply by walking at a normal pace. Let\u2019s take a closer look.\nThis year at CES 2024, Mullen Automotive showcased the Five RS. The Mullen Five RS is a fully electric sport EV crossover based off of its SUV variant, the Mullen Five. The Five RS has dual motors, All-Wheel Drive (AWD) and packs more than 1000 horsepower and over 850 ft lbs of torque thanks to its 800-volt battery architecture. With a max speed of about 200 miles per hour, the Five RS can hit 60 miles per hour in just under two seconds.\nSubscribe\nSign up with your email address to receive news and updates.\nQuick Links\nAboutReviewsBrand PartnershipTerms & Conditions\n\u00a92020 Sypnotix.

Yet for the 2024 edition, held from January 9 through 12, automakers scaled back their introductions of concept and production cars at the world\u2019s largest tech conference and exhibition, intensifying their focus on the products and services beneath the sheet metal, such as artificial intelligence (AI), connectivity, and software-driven machines. In other words, CES is now as much about what\u2019s driving the vehicle experience as what we\u2019re driving (or in some cases, flying). Here are our highlights.\nHonda 0 Saloon\nThe more captivating of the two concepts unveiled by the monumental Japanese conglomerate Honda, the Saloon gives off wedge-shaped 1970s supercar vibes for the electric era. The Saloon and its boxier counterpart, dubbed the Space Hub, comprise the Honda 0\u00a0Series, which premieres a new design language as well as a new EV platform that will reportedly underpin a production car in 2026.\nA thin lighting signature frames the front end with an illuminated \u201cH\u201d logo in the center. The interior features a yoke-style steering wheel and sustainable materials. While Honda is short on specifics, the company says the production car based on the Saloon will feature next-generation automated driving features as well as connected services and advanced AI that will learn drivers\u2019 behaviors.\nMBUX Virtual Assistant\nMercedes-Benz showed off its MBUX Virtual Assistant, which will run on the marque\u2019s forthcoming, in-house-built MB.OS operating system. The system uses advanced, real-time graphics (powered by the same technology as in video games) and generative AI for a more comprehensive and easier-to-use interface. During a roundtable discussion, which included Robb Report, Mercedes-Benz\u2019s chief technical officer, Markus Sch\u00e4fer, stated that \u201cthe car is no longer a car. It\u2019s about creating a new relationship to your vehicle.\u201d\nSoon to be expected with the new MB.OS will be productivity apps such as Zoom, as well as entertainment options like Angry Birds. Unlike BMW, which will charge customers extra for its connected content, Mercedes currently has no plans to institute a subscription model, at least according to Sch\u00e4fer.\nMBUX Sound Drive\nIn other Mercedes news, Mercedes-AMG launched Sound Drive. The app, created with help from Will.i.am, is triggered by driver inputs such as throttle, steering, and brake. On a test drive with the musician, we heard a handful of specific songs\u2014modified especially for the feature\u2014respond to our throttle with a digital revving sound complemented with multi-dimensional flourishes when we turned the wheel.\nIt\u2019s a creative way to capitalize on the quiet cabin afforded by electric cars, replacing the soundtrack of a combustion engine with enhanced music. The feature will be available on Mercedes-Benz and Mercedes-AMG production models equipped with the new MB.OS.\nVolkswagen\u2019s Voice-Activated Digital Assistant\nVolkswagen debuted a new version of its voice-activated digital assistant, which is powered by Chat GPT. The result is touted to be enhanced functionality and more natural language recognition. During a demo, we heard the new assistant suggest nearby restaurants, answer questions about the chairman of a competing car company, and create a bedtime story.\nThe latest system is slated to appear on VW\u2019s electric cars (ID.7, ID.4, ID.5, and ID.3), as well as the new Tiguan and Passat, in the second quarter of this year. Currently, the technology has only been confirmed for VW models, but we suspect similar tech might expand to the Volkswagen Group\u2019s luxury nameplates such as Audi, Bentley, Porsche, and possibly even Lamborghini.\nQualcomm\u2019s Concept Car\nWhile Qualcomm isn\u2019t making cars itself, the tech giant is a crucial supplier to some of the world\u2019s biggest automakers, including BMW, Mercedes, and Jaguar Land Rover, enabling features like in-car connectivity, telematics, and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). The many non-automotive partners for Qualcomm\u2019s products and connected solutions include Amazon Music, Bose, and TikTok.\nAt CES, Qualcomm\u2019s concept car showcased the company\u2019s AI-powered voice assistant and other connectivity features built on its Snapdragon Automotive Cockpit platform. Also announced was its Snapdragon Satellite, which will bring satellite-based, two-way messaging to next-generation Android phones. The collaboration with navigation-specialist Garmin will enable emergency messaging when a cell signal isn\u2019t available.\nBMW\u2019s Remote Valet\nBMW showed off its Remote Valet self-parking feature, which enables cars to search for spaces and park themselves autonomously in areas equipped to support the technology. Alternatively, drivers are able to park from outside the vehicle via their mobile devices. BMW also debuted its 9.0 operating system with an updated version of its voice assistant that uses Amazon\u2019s Alexa Large Language Model. And a new video app will allow for live TV and on-demand streaming.\nOther features, available through BMW\u2019s Digital Premium subscription service, include console-style, two-player gaming and a variety of other third-party apps. It\u2019s an interesting litmus test as to whether customers are ready to pay for digital content, as BMW backpedaled on its subscription fee for Apple CarPlay a few years ago.\nSupernal S-A2 eVTOL\nA Hyundai subsidiary based in Northern California\u2019s Silicon Valley, Supernal unveiled the S-A2 eVTOL designed for city operations. The zero-emissions flying machine has a purported range of 25 to 40 miles. Designed by the Genesis studio, based in Irvine, Calif., the S-A2 features reverse-opening butterfly doors, ubiquitous glass, and lime-green ambient lighting.\nHyundai and its subsidiaries have been bullish on expanding their products and services, also showing a gargantuan automated tractor, as well as the now-familiar robot dogs from Hyundai-acquired Boston Dynamics. \u201cWe have evolved from being a car company into a mobility company,\u201d stated Hyundai CEO Jay Chang at the S-A2\u2019s reveal. Judging by the 2024 CES, that\u2019s a transition many presenters can now claim.\nRead More On:\nMore Cars\nJeep Unveils Its First All-Electric Car for the U.S., the 600 HP Wagoneer S\nThese Limited-Edition Prints Meticulously Recreate Aston Martin\u2019s DB5 and Valkyrie\nThis New Ford F-150 Lightning Finally Takes the All-Electric Truck Off-Road\nA Stunning 1980 BMW M1 With Only 13,000 Miles Is Currently Up for Grabs\nElevate Your Inbox\nNewsletters curated for the connoisseur.\nGive the Gift of Luxury\nLatest Galleries in Cars\nMore From Our Brands\nRobb Report\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nLegal\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nSubscribe/Purchase\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nSubscriber Services\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret\nConnect\t\t\t\t\t\tdown caret"

It comes in two versions, one for $109,000 and one for $125,000. Only the pricier model has semi-autonomous driving assists, such as the Magic Hitch feature, which automatically connects the Pebble Flow to the vehicle towing it, as shown in the video below. Ford debuted similar technology for its F-150 pickups in April 2023.\nAnother feature is Remote Control. As Pebble describes it: \"Once unhooked from the hitch, the Pebble Flow is fully remote-controlled for easy parking and maneuvering, effortlessly pivoting and positioning itself into tight spots.\"\nAll autonomous features are controlled by the Pebble app, and powered by the Nvidia Drive Orin system-on-a-chip, a \"scalable supercomputer\" that delivers 254 trillion operations per second of compute power. The chip can also receive over-the-air updates, turning the Pebble Flow into a \"tech-first\" smart home.\n\"Nvidia Drive Orin is the world\u2019s highest-performance, automotive-grade, autonomous-vehicle processor,\" says Pebble. \"The collaboration represents the first time the RV market will see this level of computing power.\"\nThough $125,000 is certainly not cheap, it could be a compelling differentiator from the Lightship Electric RV, which also starts at $125,000 and does not currently have semi-autonomous assists. The Lightship is set to arrive in 2025.\nAesthetically, the Pebble Flow and Lightship RVs are similar, but the Lightship is slightly longer and wider at 27-feet long and 8.5-feet wide versus 25-feet long and 7.6-feet wide for the Pebble Flow. The Lightship also has an 80kWh battery compared to the Pebble Flow's 45kWh pack.\nAbout Emily Dreibelbis\nMy Experience\nPrior to starting at PCMag, I worked in Big Tech on the West Coast for six years.

The company was founded in 2022 and is based in Sunnyvale, California.\nHeadquarters Location\nSunnyvale, California,\nUnited States\nLoading...\nLoading...\nLatest Pebble News\nNov 20, 2023\nThe $50 billion travel trailer industry is finally hitching up to the electric vehicle ecosystem. Legacy companies such as Winnebago and newcomers such as Lightship and Pebble Mobility are not only electrifying their systems, but they are also changing the vehicle model itself. As more Americans move to electric cars, the trailer industry has to evolve because the towing runs down the battery quickly. The drag on battery power can make towing an RV long distances with an EV prohibitive. California-based startup Pebble Mobility has invented a self-propelled, self-powered, remote-controlled trailer. The 25-foot vehicle sleeps four and has its own electric motor. It propels itself, saving on the power needed by the car dragging it. \"We have a generous EV battery on board and an integrated solar array over the rooftop of the travel trailer \u2014 so harnessing renewable energy from the sun and powering the entire vehicle,\" said Bingrui Yang, CEO of Pebble. Yang, an Apple alum who helped build the iPhone, says he is using that knowledge to enhance the RV experience. \"We brought an iPhone-like experience to the RV, automated the hardest part, such as hitching, parking, towing, setting up camp, so that anyone can easily access all the freedom RV-ing has to offer without any of the hassle,\" he said. The user can use Pebble's app to maneuver the trailer on its own, which helps in tight spaces. That high tech is a focus for investors, such as UpHonest Capital, which is seeing a generational shift in RV use from baby boomers to millennials. \"This group of consumers are very different from the baby boomers \u2014 they are more tech forward. They are tech savvy, they want a better experience, they want a better toy experience. So they have completely different demands from the previous generation,\" said Ellen Ma, managing director at UpHonest Capital. In addition to UpHonest, Pebble is backed by Lightspeed and Vision Plus. It has raised $13.6 million in funding so far. The trailer price starts at $109,000 without the self-propelling motor. Potential tax credits could bring that down. The version with the motor starts at $125,000, which is comparable to other RVs. Yang said as they continue to grow the company, they will come out with more products at different price points, catering to consumer needs. With the solar and battery power, the Pebble makers say it can live off the grid for seven days, without propane or a generator required. The kitchen appliances, lights, AC and everything else are fully electric. Pebble aims to deliver the first models in 2024. \u2014 CNBC's Lisa Rizzolo contributed to this piece.

As the exclusive on-vehicle computer technology sponsor of the Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC), dSPACE will demonstrate how dSPACE solutions work in demanding racing environments at the Autonomous Challenge @ CES 2024 night race at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway. Eight solutions will be presented at the\u00a0dSPACE booth no. 4300\u00a0in the LVCC, West Hall. Here are some highlights:\nE-mobility: Testing of battery management systems, power electronics, and technologies for intelligent charging\nBattery management systems\u00a0(BMS) are crucial for the smooth operation of lithium-ion batteries, and ensure the efficient use of available capacity, optimum temperatures, avoid overcharging as well as deep discharges, and thereby ensure safe operation and long life of the energy storage systems. dSPACE demonstrates a modular system design for the testing of battery management systems (BMS) that enables the testing of modern BMS. The system\u2019s field of application in the areas of development and validation range from battery systems for electric cars and planes to energy storage systems for modern power grids.\nPower HIL\u00a0systems from dSPACE are the first choice where inverters, including control and power electronics, have to be tested at full power. Designed specifically for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulation at power level, they combine the flexibility of established HIL systems with full performance, enabling exceptionally precise testing of power electronics. The tests go well beyond endurance and also include testing the control behavior with different dynamic operating points of e-motors.\nThe\u00a0Smart Charging Solution\u00a0is a complete solution for the development and testing of intelligent charging technologies. The solution takes international standards into account, ensures interoperability analyses and tests, and supports developers of onboard chargers, charging stations, and, in future, inductive charging systems, robot charging, and megawatt charging for the truck and aviation sector with a comprehensive range of test options and dynamic models.\nAutonomous driving: High-precision tests in the virtual world\nThe development of functions for highly automated and autonomous driving places increasingly strict requirements on the quality and safety of functions. Virtual tests are frontloaded to earlier development phases and executed by internationally distributed development teams. To meet these requirements, dSPACE has developed solutions such as\u00a0SIMPHERA, the web-based, highly scalable cloud solution for simulation and virtual validation, and the\u00a0AURELION\u00a0sensor simulation. At CES, dSPACE will demonstrate how logical scenarios generated from measurement data can then be used for scenario-based testing in SIMPHERA. In this way, real recorded scenarios can later be used for virtual validation. In addition, it is shown how AURELION achieves a very high degree of realism in the simulation \u2013 by comparing the synthetic sensor simulation with the real recorded measurement data of the same scenario.\nIn a joint demonstration with AWS, dSPACE presents an intelligent fleet and data management environment that enables targeted data collection campaigns for the development and validation of ADAS/AD algorithms. The solution aims to drastically shorten the lead time for data acquisition from the definition of requirements to the availability of the recorded vehicle and sensor data in the data center, thereby increasing the efficiency of the\u00a0data-driven development\u00a0process.\nThe simulation of software stacks on high-performance computers (HPCs) in the newest E/E architectures for software-defined vehicles (SDVs) presents a particular challenge in software integration testing. In order to efficiently validate such systems, cloud-based software-in-the-loop environments are required that enable the simulation of the software components on HPCs based on real ARM processors together with those of the rest of the E/E architecture. To this end, dSPACE is working with AWS to offer an end-to-end solution based on\u00a0dSPACE VEOS and AWS Graviton.\nIAC: dSPACE technology during night racing and at the exhibition stand\nAt the Autonomous Challenge @ CES 2024, which will be held on January 11 at the Las Vegas Motor Speedway, nine teams comprised of 17 universities will compete against each other with fully autonomous racecars.
