With the promotion of advanced technology of artificial intelligence, our company has invested a huge amount of money in the procurement of large-scale equipment and automation equipment in the past two years. The company's total investment in fixed assets in 2021 is 10.18 million, and the total investment in 2022 is 6.62 million. Among them, the injection molding department will replace the original old machine, the vertical machine will introduce 3 new machines and the horizontal machine will introduce 1, as many as 5 sets of new punching machines have been put into the stamping part, and there are more than a dozen sets of automation equipment corresponding to different types of products. With the increasing popularity of green, environmental protection and energy conservation ideas and the efforts of governments in energy conservation and emission reduction, hybrid vehicles, smart grid technology and new energy power generation are vigorously promoted in developed countries and high-growth developing countries such as China, India and Brazil, which will greatly promote the market demand for circuit protection components. Although the pace of electronic product upgrading is accelerating, however, the company's investment in fixed assets has no reservation. It can be said that it has invested a huge amount of money to introduce various advanced equipment, which also injects the greatest power into the production of our company. Fixed assets are an important material foundation for the company to produce, operate, and finally obtain economic benefits.

Plastic height: 3.5mm 5.0mm 5.7mm 7.1mm 8.5mm.\n2023/08/08\nWhat are the processing methods of connector pins?\nThe pin structure of the connector is designed based on the static or low-speed environment of the connector, so the position of the pin structure of the connector is fixed during connection, while the running speed of the motor car or subway is very high, so the vibration is also very large. The pin structure of the connector designed to adapt to the static or low-speed environment cannot adapt to the high-speed environment, when the EMU or subway is running at high speed, the radial and axial displacement deviation occurs at the connection of the connector, which is easy to cause poor contact of the connector.\n2023/08/08\nCan RJ11 plug RJ45 module\nRJ11 can be inserted into the RJ45 module, but can not be used. Because RJ11 is a 6-pin connector and RJ45 is an 8-pin connector, it can be plugged in and cannot be used.\nThe RJ45 crystal head is a connector with 8 grooves and 8 contacts (8p8c), while the RJ11 crystal head usually has only 6 grooves and 4 contacts (6p4c). Therefore, the volume of the RJ45 crystal head is larger than that of the RJ11 crystal head. The RJ11 crystal head can usually be inserted into the RJ45 interface, but not vice versa, but it is strongly recommended not to use the RJ11 crystal head for the RJ45 interface.\n2023/08/08\nFollow Us\nHome\nAbout Us\nCompany Profile\nEnterprise Culture\nDevelopment Process\nQualification Honor\nTeam Style\nProducts\nUSB 3.1 C TYPE\nUSB3.0/3.1/3.2\nDP,HDMI\nServices\nAfter-sales service\nDownload Center\nFAQ\nNews\nCompany News\nIndustry News\nContact Us\nContact Us\nTel:\u00a0+86-769-88053188\nFax: +86-769-88055788\nEmail:\u00a0sales@new-conn.com\nWeb:http:// www.new-conn.com\nAdd.: No.29, Niushan Wooling Industrial Park, Dongcheng District, Dongguan City, Guangdong Province\nCOPYRIGHT \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Dongguan Sen Lian Precision Electronics Co., Ltd.\nSEO\nPowered by www.300.cn\u00a0\u00a0City\u00a0\u00a0Cloud Information"

As a traditional thermal conductivity material, most of them are made of silicone resin as a substrate, but under the current development of science and technology, many electronic products or electrical equipment need to work in a #pollution-#free #environment, so the silicon-free thermal conductivity gel is suitable for many environments, and the prospect is very promising.\nInterested in this silicon-free thermal gel?\nLeave a message our engineers will take the initiative to contact you, give you more information! ! !\n55 followers\nHot spot transfer: #LED #heat #dissipation solution with one-component thermal gel\nTo solve this problem, the industry began to look for efficient heat dissipation methods. One of the widely adopted solutions is the use of one-component thermal gel. This material is known for its excellent thermal conductivity and can effectively conduct heat from inside the LED display to the outside. Specifically, this\u00c2\u00a0thermal conductive gel\u00c2\u00a0is applied to key components of LED displays, such as power modules, display chips, backlight modules, etc., to enhance heat dissipation. When these parts start to heat up, the thermal gel quickly disperses the heat to other areas, preventing heat from accumulating in specific areas.\nThe advantage of one-component\u00c2\u00a0#thermalgel\u00c2\u00a0is also its excellent electrical properties and thermal stability, which means it will not have any #negative #impact on the functionality of the LED display. Additionally, due to its #one-#component nature, the gel is very easy to use and does not require complex mixing processes. Although there are other ways to dissipate heat, such as adding heat sinks or optimizing the thermal design, these methods usually require more cost and time. In contrast, using a single-component thermal gel can not only effectively improve heat dissipation efficiency in a short time, but its #cost is also relatively #low.\nTo sum up, single-component\u00c2\u00a0thermal gel\u00c2\u00a0plays a crucial role in the heat dissipation solution of LED display. It not only effectively improves the heat dissipation efficiency of the LED display, but also enhances its reliability and service life. It is a cost-effective heat dissipation solution. With the continuous advancement of LED technology, it is expected that single-component thermal gel will play a greater role in future LED display applications.\nDo you have the same LED cooling needs?\nLeave message below \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u2030 Our engineers will provide you with more information to answer your questions.\n55 followers\nWhat can TIM contribute to the Sensor industry?\n55 followers\nWe often say that the custom #thermalpad, so what can we customize?\nThe most common is to customize the #size, #shape, and #color that the customer needs. However, we will help customers customize the #hardness and #reinforcement of the material according to the expected effect of the material.\nFor example, thermal pad with #glassfiber/silicon tape: it can enhance the #tensilestrength and voltage resistance of the product\nWith #aluminumfoil: wear-resistant, protective silicone sheet\nAdhesive backing: Used for better fixing on flat and smooth surfaces.\nWe have a dedicated R&D team to help you customize more materials suitable for you.\nFor more information, please leave a message and one of our engineers will contact you !\n#TIM #Customize #Thermalmanagement #Dongguansheen\n55 followers\nRecently, many customers use #thermal #gel instead of #thermalpad or #thermal #grease to use, what are its advantages?\n1. Thermal gel is not dry for a long time, can be infinitely compressed, and has a #long service #life. Some people call thermal gel a liquid thermal silicone sheet\n2. Thermal gel has a certain adhesion, can be compressed into #various #shapes, the minimum can be compressed to several hundred microns, and there will be #no #oil and dry problems, has a certain advantage in reliability.\n3. Thermal gel has certain advantages in continuous operation, which can be directly weighed and used. The common continuous use method is the dispensing machine, which can achieve fixed-point quantitative control, #save #labor and improve #production #efficiency.\nWould you also like to try this material on your thermal management project?

Dongguan Senlian (Jianhan) Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. was approved by the provincial specialized special new small and medium-sized enterprises.\nRecently, Dongguan Senlian (Jianhan) Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. has obtained procedures such as enterprise application, preliminary review and recommendation by the competent department of small and medium-sized enterprises listed at or above the prefecture level, review by the provincial department of industry and information technology, and online publicity. It has determined the list of enterprises that have passed the review of specialized new small and medium-sized enterprises in 2022, and has issued a certificate plaque.\nPin row female connector specification selection\nRank mother series: single row needle, double row needle, single double plastic row needle, three row needle. The needle type is: 180 direct insertion, 90 side insertion, SMT patch. Plastic height: 1.5mm 2.0mm 2.54mm 3.0mm. Specifications: single-row mother, double-row mother, 180 in-line insertion, 90 side insertion, SMT patch. Plastic height: 3.5mm 5.0mm 5.7mm 7.1mm 8.5mm.\nWhat are the processing methods of connector pins?\nThe pin structure of the connector is designed based on the static or low-speed environment of the connector, so the position of the pin structure of the connector is fixed during connection, while the running speed of the motor car or subway is very high, so the vibration is also very large. The pin structure of the connector designed to adapt to the static or low-speed environment cannot adapt to the high-speed environment, when the EMU or subway is running at high speed, the radial and axial displacement deviation occurs at the connection of the connector, which is easy to cause poor contact of the connector.\nCan RJ11 plug RJ45 module\nRJ11 can be inserted into the RJ45 module, but can not be used. Because RJ11 is a 6-pin connector and RJ45 is an 8-pin connector, it can be plugged in and cannot be used.\nThe RJ45 crystal head is a connector with 8 grooves and 8 contacts (8p8c), while the RJ11 crystal head usually has only 6 grooves and 4 contacts (6p4c). Therefore, the volume of the RJ45 crystal head is larger than that of the RJ11 crystal head. The RJ11 crystal head can usually be inserted into the RJ45 interface, but not vice versa, but it is strongly recommended not to use the RJ11 crystal head for the RJ45 interface.\nFollow Us\nHome\nAbout Us\nCompany Profile\nEnterprise Culture\nDevelopment Process\nQualification Honor\nTeam Style\nProducts\nUSB 3.1 C TYPE\nUSB3.0/3.1/3.2\nDP,HDMI\nServices\nAfter-sales service\nDownload Center\nFAQ\nNews\nCompany News\nIndustry News\nContact Us\nContact Us\nTel:\u00a0+86-769-88053188\nFax: +86-769-88055788\nEmail:\u00a0sales@new-conn.com\nWeb:http:// www.new-conn.com\nAdd.: No.29, Niushan Wooling Industrial Park, Dongcheng District, Dongguan City, Guangdong Province\nCOPYRIGHT \u00c2\u00a9 2023 Dongguan Sen Lian Precision Electronics Co., Ltd.\nSEO\nPowered by www.300.cn\u00a0\u00a0City\u00a0\u00a0Cloud Information"
