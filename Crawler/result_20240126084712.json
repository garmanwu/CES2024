Charles Hwang et al.\nCase Summary\nOn March 30, 2022, Ningbo Ruihua Electronics Plastics Co., Ltd.,(\u201cPlaintiff\u201d or \u201cRuihua\u201d), represented by David J. Tsai of Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP, filed an intellectual property lawsuit against Charles Hwang a.k.a han-Chieh Hwang a.k.a Hanjie Huang (\u201cHwang\u201d) and John/ Jane Doe(s) (collectively,\u201cDefendants\u201d), seeking declaratory and injunctive relief and damages along with costs for the alleged infringement of the United States Patent owned by Plaintiff. This case was filed in the U.S. District Court in the Central District of California with Judges John W. Holcomb and Shashi H. Kewalramani presiding.\nThe plaintiff filed this complaint for the alleged infringement of U.S. Patent No.9,407,102\u00a0 (\u201cthe \u2019102 Patent\u201d) owned by the plaintiff.\nIn the complaint the plaintiff alleged, \u201cFounded in 1994 in Ningbo, China, Ruihua is a leading designer and manufacturer of lead-acid and lithium-ion jump starter products and accessories. Ruihua launched its first jump starter products in 1998. Since then, Ruihua has continued to develop and advance its innovative core technology for battery charging and jumper cable designs under the leadership of Ruihua\u2019s Co-Founder and President, Mr. Senliao Lou.\u201d\nThe plaintiff further alleged, \u201cSpecifically, on January 21, 2013, Ruihua filed a Chinese utility model patent application on the main structure and key components, which later issued on August 7, 2013, as Chinese Utility Model Patent No. CN203119522U (\u2018the \u2019522U Patent\u2019). A true and correct copy of the \u2019522U Patent and a certified translation thereof are attached as Exhibits A and B, respectively.\u201d\nThe plaintiff also filed three more patent applications for Chinese Design Patent No. CN302435617S (\u201cthe \u2019617S Patent\u201d); Chinese Design Patent No. CN302535063S (\u201cthe \u2019063S Patent\u201d); Chinese Patent No. CN103456905B (\u201cthe \u2019905 Patent\u201d).\nThe plaintiff also alleged, \u201cAlso unbeknownst to Ruihua, Hwang used Ruihua\u2019s trade secrets to apply for a provisional patent in his own name in the United States on September 27,\u00a0 2013, which ultimately issued on August 2, 2016, as U.S. Patent No. 9,407,102 (\u2018the \u2019102 Patent\u2019). In particular, Hwang disclosed Ruihua\u2019s trade secrets relating to its battery connection design and voltage source design, including figures used in Ruihua\u2019s then unpublished Chinese patent application for the \u2019905 Patent. A true and correct copy of the \u2019102 Patent is attached as Exhibit I.\u201d\nThe plaintiff also alleged that \u201ccertain unknown John/Jane Doe Defendants unlawfully acted in concert with Hwang to obtain and disclose Ruihua\u2019s confidential proprietary technologies, including the battery connection design, the voltage source design and Ruihua\u2019s early designs of its 55 Series products, including the design of externally connected air compressors.\u201d\nThe plaintiff brought four claims for relief. The first claim is for alleged correction of inventorship under 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 256. The second claim is for alleged declaration of ownership of the \u2019102 Patent Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2201 and 2202. The third and fourth claims are for alleged misappropriation of trade secrets under the Defend Trade Secrets Act and California Uniform Trade Secrets Act.\nIn their prayer for relief the plaintiff has requested declaration and correction of ownership of the \u2019102 Patent and enjoining the Defendants from using Plaintiff\u2019s confidential information. The plaintiff also requested an award of actual and exemplary damages along with costs and attorneys\u2019 fees or any other such relief that the court deems appropriate.\nThis is a summary of a legal complaint.
