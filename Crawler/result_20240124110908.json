It will enable data capture for fleet management, testing, and validation with edge computation. It also facilitates remote diagnostics and over-the-air (OTA) software updates. This solution is especially beneficial for low volume series production.\n\u201cThe neoVI CONNECT platform was developed in collaboration with a customer, one of the world\u2019s largest vehicle OEMs. They were initially using our existing neoVI Cloud wireless data logger for fleet management on a low-volume vehicle. Eventually, they discovered that it perfectly suited their requirements for series production, and it came with low-to-no development costs,\u201d said Dave Robins, CEO of Intrepid Control Systems. \u201cWe developed the expanded neoVI CONNECT to deliver a significant cost savings platform for the entire auto industry. Intrepid\u2019s development costs are shared with its customers, which consist of all electric vehicle OEMs in the US and most of the world\u2019s ICE OEMs.\u201d\nThe neoVI CONNECT platform surpasses the traditional idea of data logging technology. It serves as a robust and adaptable foundation. Additionally, it seamlessly integrates application and service functions for vehicle manufacturers and service providers. It enables users to manage fleets, create an ECU simulator, develop a gateway solution, test vehicles, and capture data with an all-in-one, production-ready device.\nEngineers designed it to meet or exceed OEM series production ECU requirements for electromagnetic capability, environmental durability, and reliability. A ruggedized IP67 enclosure, employing automotive connection systems with compact packaging, accommodates the unit for permanent installation in vehicles.\nDesigners have created the neoVI CONNECT platform with client integration in mind. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) centers it around silicon and runs Intrepid\u2019s Wireless neoVI (WIVI) cloud client software. WIVI is a market-proven solution for cloud-based vehicle testing and development, offering big data analysis and dashboards. Intrepid is a partner of both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Verizon to enable this reliable end-to-end solution.\nRunning on AWS, the WIVI cloud software can optionally run on private OEM servers.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Enabling data capture for fleet management, testing and validation with edge computation, remote diagnostics, and over-the-air (OTA) software updates, this inventive technology provides a practical solution for low volume series production - saving OEMs millions of dollars in future production costs.\n\"The neoVI CONNECT platform was created through engagement with a customer, one of the world's largest vehicle OEMs, who was using our existing neoVI Cloud wireless data logger for fleet management on a low volume vehicle and found it was exactly what they needed for series production with low-to-no development costs,\" said Dave Robins, CEO of Intrepid Control Systems. \"From that, we developed the expanded neoVI CONNECT to deliver a significant cost savings platform for the entire auto industry, as Intrepid's development costs are shared with its customers, which consist of all electric vehicle OEMs in the US and most of the world's ICE OEMs.\"\nThe neoVI CONNECT platform goes beyond the conventional concept of data logging technology by serving as a robust and adaptable foundation that seamlessly integrates application and service functions for vehicle manufacturers and service providers. It enables users to manage fleets, create an ECU simulator, develop a gateway solution, test vehicles, and capture datawith an all-in-one, production-ready device.\nIt is engineered to meet or exceed OEM series production ECU requirements for electromagnetic capability, environmental durability and reliability and is housed in a ruggedized IP67 enclosure using automotive connection systems with compact packaging, allowing permanent vehicle installation.\nDesigned for ease of client integration, the neoVI CONNECT platform is centered around silicon from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) and runs Intrepid's Wireless neoVI (WIVI) cloud client software, which is a market-proven solution for cloud-based vehicle testing and development that provides big data analysis and dashboards. Intrepid is a partner of both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Verizon to enable this reliable end-to-end solution.\u00c2\nRunning on AWS, the WIVI cloud software can optionally run on private OEM servers. The WIVI client runs on OEM hardware and is available for licensing for OEMs or Tier1s who are looking to make their connected vehicle plans happen now without large development cost or risk.\nTo see a demonstration and learn more about the features and benefits of the neoVI CONNECT, as well as explore Intrepid's comprehensive suite of tools for software-defined vehicles and zonal architectures, visit Intrepid Control Systems at CES booth #3666 in the Las Vegas Convention Center, West Hall.\nAbout Intrepid Control SystemsIntrepid Control Systems (https://intrepidcs.com) has been thriving for over 30 years, producing advanced hardware and software tools for engineers in vehicle autonomy, connectivity, automotive Ethernet and embedded engineering.
