        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Virginia Tech, partners design blueprint to improve self-driving vehicles with $7.5 million grant\nOn Oct. 11, researchers from Virginia Tech\u2019s Transportation Institute and their partners put an autonomous Ford F-150 through a series of driving scenarios related to public safety on the I-395 express lanes in Arlington. Pictured is a touch screen that law enforcement uses to communicate with the vehicle. (Photo courtesy of Transurban North America)\nResearchers at Virginia Tech\u2019s Transportation Institute will soon hand the keys to lawmakers and developers, after creating a blueprint for how self-driving vehicles can safely interact with other cars on state roadways.\nIn 2019, Virginia Tech was awarded a $7.5 million grant from the U.S. Federal Highway Administration to gather data on improving autonomous driving vehicles (ADS) in roadway scenarios \u2013 including navigating safely around first responders, construction workers and work zones \u2013 amid increases in self-driving vehicle crashes.\n\u201cOur goal is just to make transportation better,\u201d said Zac Doerzaph, executive director of VTTI, after an Oct. 11 presentation in Northern Virginia on the closed Interstate 395 express lanes.\nThe project was completed in partnership with the Virginia Department of Transportation, Crash Avoidance Metrics Partners LLC, a consortium of vehicle manufacturers and global toll operator Transurban North America, which oversees the Interstates 495, 95, and 395 express lanes in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan region.\nWhile autonomous driving vehicles, or self-driving vehicles, rely on artificial intelligence and can operate without a driver, the vehicles and their developers have faced criticism for their increase in crashes nationwide. Data from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an entity under the U.S. Department of Transportation, shows that Virginia recorded 13 crashes with SAE Level 2 Advanced Driver Assistance Systems, which increased to 31 through August. SAE International, which is a global association of engineers and technical experts, developed the levels based on a self-driving vehicle\u2019s capabilities.\nIn June 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, an entity under the U.S. Department of Transportation, began requiring manufacturers and operators to report crashes involving their self-driving vehicles.\n\u201cThe U.S. Department of Transportation\u2019s top priority is safety,\u201d the highway administration said in a 2019 statement. \u201cAutomation offers the potential to improve safety for vehicle operators, occupants, and other travelers sharing the road.\u201d\nNot every automated driving system is the same and varies based on their offerings.\nAccording to the safety administration, the basic ADS can perform without driver involvement, but is still being tested on public roads and is not available for consumer purchase. A Level 2 advanced driver assistance system provides both speed and steering input, but requires the human driver to remain engaged in driving at all times.\nAnother issue with self-driving vehicles is their lack of response to commands because they rely on wireless connectivity.\nOn Oct. 24, autonomous car company Cruise was ordered to remove all of its vehicles from roads in San Francisco, after the California Department of Motor Vehicles and the state\u2019s public utilities commission determined the vehicles caused \u201cunreasonable risk\u201d to public safety.\nThe suspension was handed down after the General Motors-owned tech startup failed to disclose the full details of an Oct. 2 collision that trapped a pedestrian underneath an autonomous vehicle.\nFor four years, the project team worked to create a blueprint for autonomous vehicle developers. The group consisted of equipment manufacturers and public safety and services partners to help address the challenges of safely operating autonomous vehicles in real-world scenarios, according to Tech\u2019s Transportation Institute.\nResearchers said one of the challenges for self-driving vehicles is the need for more real-time and distance information, which the vehicles need to optimally operate.\nThe group then developed a software platform that could provide information such as the traffic conditions, work zones, and potential incidents to the vehicle.\nTransurban supported the project by allowing researchers to use the I-395 express lanes in Northern Virginia to identify solutions for self-driving vehicles in several scenarios. The lanes are also equipped with roadside sensors to help the institute\u2019s Level 4 Ford F-150 autonomous vehicle, equipped with sensors and cameras.\n\u201cThe future of how we get from point A to point B is changing every day. Transurban and our partners know we must continually innovate to keep travelers safer as technology enables the next generation of transportation,\u201d said Mike Discenza, acting president of Transurban North America. \u201cTransurban\u2019s proprietary, embedded technologies and closed environment on the 395 Express Lanes enable the perfect testing ground for infrastructure that talks to vehicles and vice versa \u2014 making roads safer as travel turns autonomous.\u201d\nThe Crash Avoidance Metrics Partners LLC helped develop a list of 18 situations for the research. Some included detecting upcoming hazards and navigating through construction workers and work zones.\n\u201cA lot of the scenarios that we developed are impactful,\u201d said Joe McLaine, general safety manager for General Motors and chair of the CAMP LLC. \u201cWe believe that solving them and showing technological innovation and movement towards implementing those is a great step and the reason why we\u2019re a part of this project.\u201d\nOne situation of note was when the F-150 responded to law enforcement by pulling over to the far right lane on the closed express lane. When the Virginia State Trooper car pulled closer to the ADS and flashed its lights, the vehicle turned its right blinker on and when appropriate, moved from the middle lane to the emergency lane.\nThe trooper exited his vehicle, approached the ADS on the right passenger side and used a touch screen on the window to communicate with the vehicle\u2019s fleet manager or a human to resolve any issue. After gathering the necessary information, the trooper proceeded back to his vehicle. The ADS then turned on its left blinker and safely merged back into its previous lane.\nResearchers said the early stages of the project required a lot of trust because the autonomous vehicle can come to a more abrupt stop compared to a human driver.\nLast year, the Virginia Department of Transportation told the Mercury that Virginia has no law written for autonomous vehicles. The agency published a strategic plan for operating autonomous vehicles in 2020. VDOT expects deployment of the vehicles to impact safety and mobility for drivers, and create opportunities for economic development.\nVirginia has already started making space for self-driving vehicles. According to SmartCities Dive, Interstate 66 in Northern Virginia reopened with lanes to support self-driving cars last year.\nDoerzaph said the study is expected to help lawmakers with future policy decisions, one of which could be in establishing an interoperable connected ecosystem for transportation.\nDoerzaph said the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, which the Federal Highway Administration created, provided the best practices for the way roadways are designed. The manual also helped during the study by identifying what work zones are easier to address for ADS than others.\nMike Mollenhauer, division director of technology implementation at VTTI, said the sensors provided by Transurban helped the self-driving vehicle understand the road conditions, but he is unsure if vehicles will need them in the future. Sensors \u201ccan really make the experience better,\u201d he said.\n\u201cI think, at some level, you have to have some ability to have infrastructure play a role in this deployment, but I don\u2019t know that you have to have [it] as competent of a system as what Transurban operates here,\u201d Mollenhauer said.\n\u201cCertainly for early deployment, it\u2019s a benefit,\u201d he added, \u201cbut because you want that additional information, you can potentially do it safer than you could otherwise.\u201d\nVirginia Tech will publish its findings online in early 2024, including videos and photos, according to Mollenhauer.\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES DELIVERED TO YOUR INBOX\nVirginia Tech, partners design blueprint to improve self-driving vehicles with $7.5 million grant\nby Nathaniel Cline, Virginia Mercury October 30, 2023\nOur stories may be republished online or in print under Creative Commons license CC BY-NC-ND 4.0.

        "raw_content": "News\nFinance\nSports\nEntertainment\nLife\nAll the future of transportation tech that stood out at CES 2024\nAnother CES has come and gone and transportation was still one of the central actors on one of the world's largest tech stages. It wasn't just electric cars either that captured our attention at CES 2024.\nCompanies and startups focused on automated driving, EV charging, software (and more specifically AI), sensors, aviation, boats, drones, micromobility \u2014 you name it \u2014 were there. And luckily, so was TechCrunch.\nHere are some of the tech themes that stood out to us at CES 2024.\nEverything electric\nImage Credits: Kirsten Korosec\nThe Big Three U.S. automakers \u2014 GM, Ford and Stellantis \u2014 may not have had splashy displays and product reveals, but numerous others were there helping cement CES as a major auto show. Honda, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, Sony, Turkey's Togg and VinFast all showed off electric concepts and production cars at the event.\nIt wasn't just large, established automakers that had a presence at CES 2024 either. Electrification has seeped into every corner of transportation, from motorcycles and e-bikes to go karts, big rigs, boats and aircraft.\nFor instance, Segway revealed two electric scooters, the E2 Pro and Superscooter ST1, two e-bikes called the Segway Xafari and the Segway Xyber as well as a Segway GoKart Pro 2 that can be connected to a PC and used for playing racing games like Forza.\nStartups were also in full force and could be found at a variety of CES-related events such as Pepcom and Unveiled. Cleveland, Ohio-based startup Land Energy was back with its sporty e-bike that has a swappable battery, while Finland's Verge Motorcycles showed off its Verge TS Ultra, an electric motorcycle with a hubless ring design, advanced driver assist tech and a powertrain that produces an eye-popping 201 horsepower and 885 pound-feet of torque. Over in Eureka Park, where hundreds of startups set up shop, electrification was also present. One startup that caught my eye was Solar Buggy, a company that has developed an electric urban mobility vehicle that looks like an enclosed golf cart.\nImage Credits: Kirsten Korosec\nAnd of course, there were the electric aircraft and drones. On the startup front, Pivotal opened up online orders for its personal electric aircraft the Helix while autonomous on-demand drone companies Zipline and Wing landed a huge deal with Walmart. Hyundai's advanced air mobility unit Supernal revealed its production-intent electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft and Xpeng Aeroht, the subsidiary of Chinese electric vehicle maker Xpeng Motors, showed off a new concept and announced that deliveries for its Land Aircraft Carrier would start in late 2025.\nWith so many electric vehicles, it might not surprise folks to learn that EV charging companies were also there en masse. Outside of the better-known charging infrastructure companies, we found startups focused on EV charging software as well as those showing off novel approaches like WiTricity's wireless charging tech.\nGenerative AI\nImage Credits: Volkswagen\nBefore even stepping foot on the show floor, TechCrunch staff were forecasting that AI would dominate CES 2024. We weren't wrong. AI was everywhere, including in transportation from cars and e-bikes to scooters and electric aviation.\nThere were loads of companies touting AI. While there was certainly plenty of vaporware, many companies demonstrated how software is increasingly incorporating AI to offer (hopefully) more capable products, including vehicle sensors, voice assistants in cars and autonomous driving systems.\nThere was also lots of chatter around generative AI, and more specifically, ChatGPT, the AI-powered chatbot that functions by using large language models that have been trained on vast datasets. I checked out two ChatGPT demos: one with BMW and another from a collaboration with software company Cerence and Volkswagen.\nVolkswagen announced plans to add an AI-powered chatbot into all Volkswagen models equipped with its IDA voice assistant.\nMeanwhile, BMW and partner Amazon showed off a development project that uses generative AI, powered by the Alexa LLM, to give the automaker's voice assistant greater capability and deliver information in a more human, conversational manner.\nHydrogen\nJae Hoon Chang, president and CEO of Hyundai Motor Co., center, and Chang Hwan Kim, senior vice president and head of battery development and hydrogen and fuel cell development for Hyundai Motor Co at CES 2024. Image Credits: Getty images via Bloomberg\nHydrogen power isn't new, but it's taken a bit of a backseat lately to more traditional battery electric vehicles. Don't tell anyone at CES 2024, though, as this year's show floor was littered with vehicles of all sizes that are hydrogen-powered.\nHyundai, which has a growing portfolio of battery-powered electric vehicles, came to CES to talk about hydrogen fuel cells and its vision for the alternative fuel. Nikola finally showed off one of its first U.S.-built hydrogen trucks that it's starting to ship to customers and Bosch, which already makes hydrogen fuel cells (like the one Nikola uses in its truck), announced it will make an engine that can combust hydrogen. Truck maker PACCAR also showed off a hydrogen-powered truck.\nWe also ran into other hydrogen-focused startups that were walking the halls to meet with media, potential investors and industry folks. Croft Motors was one we came across. The startup is developing \"rugged\" hydrogen-powered vehicles, starting with a three-row, prototype SUV with an \"anticipated 1,000 miles of driving range.\"\nIn-cabin hardware meets software\nHarman shows off its ReadyCare product at CES 2024. Image Credits: Kirsten Korosec\nAutomakers, automotive suppliers and even some startups showed off their respective vision for the inside of the car. Yes, there were plenty of touchscreens, including the popular curved design.\nIn-car tech stretched well beyond that, though, into areas of safety, health assessments and entertainment. Eye-tracking tech was everywhere. For instance, Harman showed off its branded Ready Care system, which can measure a driver's eye activity, cognitive load and vital signs to determine the level of focus and attention on the road ahead.\nA number of companies also showcased how hardware such as cameras and other sensors once used for safety are now being leveraged for other more comfort-focused services. Bosch showed how eye-tracking tech could be used during your drive to figure out what points of interest you\u2019re looking at, and the car could offer contextual information.\nMeanwhile, Mercedes presented a whole package of features that when combined creates a full experience for the driver and passengers, including an upgraded voice assistant, in-car gaming, immersive audio and an app developed by will.i.am's new company Sound Drive that matches the throttle, brakes and steering to a sort of intelligent multichannel mixer that influences songs playing in the car.\nMy takeaway: Companies understand that drivers and passengers are a captured audience, so to speak. And they're all working on ways to bring all the tech we have on our phones and homes into the car."

        "raw_content": "Virginia Tech Transportation Institute creates the future of transportation safety\n21 Nov 2023\nIn the early 1990s, Tom Dingus had an idea that bridged the gap between research and real-world driving.\nAt the time, most transportation safety research was conducted in a simulator, a significantly controlled test track environment, or through analysis of crash databases. Dingus strived to step outside of the controlled environment box and into a natural transportation environment \u2014 the open road.\nA director of the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute\u2019s (VTTI) for more than 20 years, Dingus pioneered unobtrusively placing cameras and sensors inside a volunteer\u2019s vehicle to assess driver behavior, crashes, and near-crash incidents. Naturalistic driving studies, as it became known, utilizes VTTI\u2019s data acquisition systems to create a continuous stream of data \u2014 from key on to key off \u2014 which is time synchronized, captured, transferred, stored at Virginia Tech.\n\u201cThe ultimate goal of the project was to fill a knowledge gap,\u201d Dingus said. \u201cThe gap was between crash databases where you can't really understand driver behavior in the seconds preceding a crash or even during a crash and test track studies, which are really very valuable but contrived.\u201d\nOver the past 35 years, naturalistic driving study data has been collected from nearly 7,000 vehicles, including cars, tractor-trailers, bicycles, and e-scooters. It would take about 1,030 years to watch all the video. The data has ultimately been used to improve the transportation system for everyone who uses the roads, while also helping secure funding from over 100 sponsors and propelling VTTI to its current status as a top transportation research institute.\nCreating a data acquisition system\nThe naturalistic driving studies concept was just the beginning. Dingus wanted to instrument 100 cars, a project that eventually came to fruition when it was funded in 2000 by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.\n\u201cWhen I started, it took me three months to instrument a vehicle with the necessary equipment,\u201d said Andy Petersen, the institute\u2019s chief engineer. \u201cWhen Tom had the idea that he wanted to instrument 100 cars, I thought he was crazy.\u201d\nWith the federal funding as well as funding from the Virginia Department of Transportation, Petersen and Dingus helped create the first generation of data acquisition systems for the \"100-car study, which was the first large-scale, naturalistic driving study ever undertaken.\nThe first-generation of the system was about the size of a briefcase and took eight hours to be installed by two people. With the initial prototype being created in the early 1990s, the footage was originally recorded on VHS tapes, but by the time 13-month 100-car study completed, the recordings were stored digitally.\nMultiple generations of the system have been created since, each decreasing in equipment size, increasing in computing power, and shortening installation time, allowing for more cars to be used for data collection.\n\u201cThe Hardware Engineering Lab at VTTI has been integral in the advancement of these systems,\u201d said Carl Cospel, director of electronic systems and technology innovation at VTTI. \u201cWe design these to be able to collect the most accurate video and data that we possibly can\u00a0 while being able to withstand the harsh environment that we find in vehicles, both electrical and environmental.\u201d\nThe most recent data acquisition systems rolled out in 2016 and 2019. These Generation 3 systems provided HD and 4K video streams from digital cameras, higher sampling rates of sensors, and more expansion buses for integration with the latest generation vehicle networks. The enhanced recording resolution allowed for even further data review as researchers got a clearer picture of crash and near-crash incidents as well as driver distractions.\nThe \u201c100-car study\u201d received more than 15,000 citations and impacted safety regulations, driver distraction and impairment policies, and many more aspects of transportation on both a national and international scale. Since then, researchers from VTTI have expanded naturalistic driving studies to include tractor-trailers, motorcycles, bicycles, and even e-scooters.\nResearch to practice\nIn January 2021, Virginia became the 22nd\u00a0state to ban handheld phone usage while driving. In support of this legislation, VTTI produced statistics that showed the dangers of distracted driving for both cars and trucks.\n\u201cThis work is continuously saving lives,\u201d said Rich Hanowski, director of the Division of Freight, Transit, and Heavy Vehicle Safety at VTTI. \u201cOur work has helped to evaluate hours-of-service regulations for truck drivers, creating a safer transportation system for all road users by mitigating truck driver fatigue.\u201d\nThe tremendous amount of video and advanced sensor data collected has allowed researchers to make a positive impact on transportation such as changes to vehicle safety system design and policy recommendations to government and industry partners. By taking data collection out of controlled environments and into the real world at a large scale, it has empowered researchers from the institute to create a more equitable transportation system.\nData aquisiion systems \"allow us to not only look at current problems in transportation but also work to develop solutions for the future,\u201d said Miguel Perez, a research scientist at VTTI.\nThe future of transportation safety\nAs VTTI celebrates its 35th year of advancing transportation through innovation, the need for continued research is increasingly important.\nTo assist in this workflow, researchers from the institute are embracing a new tactic that will decrease the ebbs and flows of research funding from private industry and government partners.\n\u201cOur next step is to engage in perpetual naturalistic driving systems,\u201d said Jon Hankey, a senior transportation fellow at VTTI. \u201cThrough targeting the most advanced systems that are being put in the field and collecting naturalistic driving data on them, we will be able to constantly collect data and analyze it for future safety applications.\u201d\nWith the increased load of research, an increased number of\u00a0participants are needed to help shape the future of transportation.\nNaturalistic driving studies paired with data acquisition systems have proven to be one of the most impactful transportation research methods. With the inclination to never stop, researchers from VTTI are ready to tackle the next transportation safety challenge in their mission to save lives, time, money, and protect the environment.\nContacts:\nLindsey\nHaugh\nEric Holbrook\nTags\nRelated Content\nRelated Content\nGlobal Impact\nVirginia Tech demonstrates impact as a global land grant \u2013 progressing sustainability in our community, through the Commonwealth of Virginia, and around the world.\nGet Directions\nSee All Locations\nContact Virginia Tech\nFor the media\n\u00a9\u00a02024 Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.
