Join now\nCES 2024 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c An Industrial Designer's Perspective\nIndustrial Craft\nCES made a jubilant return, attracting a post-pandemic crowd of tech enthusiasts eager to explore the latest global innovations. With over 150,000 attendees, it boasted the highest turnout in recent years. Yet, as an industrial designer, I couldn't help but have some reservations about its implications and our role as industrial designers. Let's delve into that.\nAmid the scent of freshly manufactured injection-molded parts and newly minted PCBs, there lingered a familiar \"Foxconn\" aroma. When most of the displayed products seem far from essential, we must prioritize environmental sustainability over consumerism. The near absence of sustainable strategies from companies is a serious concern. What steps are we taking as industrial designers to help \u00a0lead sustainable strategies for the companies we collaborate with?\nOne stark observation at CES was its ongoing male-dominated attendance, with roughly 80% of participants being men. (I did my own hack reaserch by counting 20 people walking past me. 18/20 were male) This raises intriguing questions about the products tailored to this demographic and prompts us to envision how CES might evolve with more women-led companies involved. In a memorable conversation with the lead engineer of a speaker company known for its predominantly black masculine-looking designs. \u00a0I shared insights from my work on Sonos products. I recounted how ethnographic research revealed that women, who often play a pivotal role in purchasing new speakers, were particularly concerned about how these devices would harmonize with the aesthetics of their homes, especially with white walls. Hence Sonos comes in both black and white.) It was an enlightening moment, emphasizing the relevance of diversity in our industrial design teams and the importance of ethnographic research and inclusive design in product development.\nArguably, the most significant shift from a few years ago was the influx of Chinese OBM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s (Original Brand Manufacturing) \u00a0companies design, produce, and sell products under their own brand name) at CES. These companies showcased a diverse array of products, many of which bore striking resemblances to offerings from established global brands like Dyson, iRobot, GoPro, and Apple. Surprisingly, this unapologetic emulation of major brands doesn't appear to raise significant concerns among these OBMs or attendees. What implications does this hold for industrial designers who often find inspiration in creating mood boards from other consumer electronic products. And then what role will AI play for industrial designers who key offering is product styling?\nHowever, what truly stood out to me were the exceptional levels of build quality displayed by these Chinese OBMs. In an era where consumers increasingly turn to online e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Alibaba, new shopping behaviors have emerged. People often prioritize star ratings over well-established brand names when making purchasing decisions. Major global brands are reevaluating their reliance on physical stores to convey their identity, underscoring the role of innovative industrial design in building a strong and consistent design and brand language.\nChinese factories have been manufacturing American-designed products since the early '90s and have perfected the \"know-how\" required to produce high-quality items. This transformation over the years has been remarkable. Moreover, Chinese design schools are producing **10,000 graduates annually. The influx of \"good enough\" products from Chinese \"knock-off\" brands, offering a plethora of aesthetic choices at competitive prices, presents a challenge to established global brands. \u00a0Companies like, Sony, Samsung, and LG must focus on maintaining a strong brand identity, a consistent design language, and providing consumers with compelling reasons to choose their products beyond aesthetics or they will be competing on price against the Chinese OBM\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\nIt was a pleasant experience to witness various companies exploring electrical energy storage solutions powered by solar energy at CES. These innovations ranged from comprehensive whole-house setups featuring Lithium-Ion batteries, solar panels, and inverters to Lithium-Ion emergency backup generators designed to replace fossil fuel generators. These developments underscore the need for environmentally conscious industrial design practices within our field.\nIn my opinion, the most captivating section of the show was dedicated to startups. These companies presented a myriad of intriguing product ideas, from robots designed to entertain your dog while you're at work to a groundbreaking toothbrush promising the same results as an electric brush in a fraction of the time. However, many of these startups faced a fundamental challenge\u00e2\u20ac\u201dthey were product-focused rather than having a comprehensive approach to their companies. When I inquired about their plans for a second or third product, most seemed perplexed. This highlights the significance of a well-rounded industrial design strategy, encompassing brand development, a cohesive design language, a strategic product roadmap, and a distinct product identity.\nLicensing also appeared to be on the rise, with some notable examples, such as Reebok licensing its brand to an electric scooter company and Kodak licensing its brand for use in smartwatches, headphones, speakers, and other unrelated products, departing from the original Kodak brand. The liberal use of brands in this manner raised concerns, reminiscent of the final flicker of a dying star before it collapses into a black hole. Industrial designers must carefully consider the implications of such licensing agreements on brand identity and design coherence.\nA significant shift was evident in the tech landscape as wearable technology, which dominated CES five years ago, gave way to scooters. The show featured a plethora of scooter-related products from various companies, most offering similar functionality but differing in design aesthetics. This shift underscores the dynamic nature of industrial design trends and the importance of staying attuned to evolving consumer interests.\nInnovation in consumer electronics is becoming increasingly cost-intensive, often accessible only to larger international brands with the financial resources required to push the envelope. With startup funds dwindling and the rise of Chinese OBMs, opportunities for industrial designers have become scarcer. This changing landscape compels us to consider innovative approaches and adaptability in our design practice.\nIn conclusion, CES 2024 provided invaluable insights for industrial designers, emphasizing the importance of sustainability, adaptability, innovation, and a holistic approach to product design and the importance of industrial design as part of brand.\n**More than 11,000 industrial design students graduate annually from 230 schools in China (National Instructional Committee of Industrial Design Education China, 2005).\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\nMore articles by this author\n10 Lessons for Innovative Product Design\nDesigning the Future of Healthcare: Medical Robotics\nDesigning Experiences: Design's Greater Purpose\nEasy is Hard to Do\nHow to Invest in Design\nDesigning Solar into our Homes\nBeyond the Smartphone\nThe Future of Wearables\nDesign for All Ages\nEvolving User-Centered Design: Engage Stakeholders and Experts.

AGC will be on hand to showcase 20 cutting-edge solutions, mainly glass for the auto industry, all focusing on three areas: detection, connection and comfortability, to lead the next generation of mobility.\nAGC has been in operation for over a century, supplying innovative materials and solutions to meet the demands of the ever-changing society. As it works to shift automotive glass from simply serving as a barrier to becoming multi-functional, the company approaches its products through the lens of creating not only economic value but also social value.\n\u201cAt AGC, we firmly believe that glass and performance chemicals permeate every aspect of your living environment, enabling us to drive innovation across all domains with our cutting-edge technology,\u201d said Hideyuki Kurata, CTO. \u201cWe have been refining core technologies such as material technology, functional design, and production technology since its foundation. With our advanced materials and solutions showcased at CES, we aim to drive innovation in the next generation of mobility. We invite you to experience them firsthand at our booth.\"\nThe products AGC will highlight at the show include:\nDetection: Wideye\n\u25cf Wideye is an infrared, transparent and high-optical performance automotive glass for vision glazing, trims and sensor covers. It is specially crafted for advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving and can be mounted on multiple vehicle parts to ensure optimal protection while maintaining a sleek design.\nConnection: 5G-compatible Glass Antenna\n\u25cf Elegantly designed, these glass antennas are compatible with all frequencies of 5G. They can be installed from the interior side of existing window glass, thereby converting the windows into antennas. Halo.Car, an innovative Las Vegas-based EV driverless car service that uses 5G, has incorporated AGC\u2019s glass antennas, which have been used strategically to minimize communication drops.\nComfortability: Automotive Display Cover Glass\n\u25cf We were the first in the world to introduce automotive display cover glass. Leveraging advanced processing technology, quality, and strength, as well as the advantages of film deposition technologies such as anti-reflective and fingerprint-resistant coatings, we have achieved \"safety\",\u00a0\"high visibility\",\u00a0and \"superior aesthetics\".\u00a0This time, we are planning to showcase large, curved displays.\nCES attendees and automotive enthusiasts can visit the AGC exhibition to learn more about these innovations at Booth 6667 in LVCC West Hall Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility.
