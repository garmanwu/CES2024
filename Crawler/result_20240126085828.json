She previously wrote about everything from web development to AI at Inside.\nShare this story\nNanoleaf introduced its first dedicated outdoor lights during CES 2024 in a move that should help the company catch up with rivals like Hue, Govee, and Twinkly. The Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights\u00a0and Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights are the latest additions to the company\u2019s Matter Essentials line and will be available this spring.\nThe new color-changing, addressable outdoor lights make Nanoleaf a more competitive player in the smart lighting world. Last year, Nanoleaf\u2019s Essentials Matter Smart Holiday String Lights made it to our list of the best holiday smart string lights, but the Philips Hue Festavia string lights were ultimately our top choice. That\u2019s in part because of how limited Nanoleaf\u2019s ecosystem was when it comes to outdoor lights, rendering them better for decorating Christmas trees than big outdoor displays. With these new lights, the game could change.\nLike the other products in the Matter Essentials line, the new outdoor lights are Matter-compatible, so they can work with a range of major smart home platforms, including Apple Home, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings. As a result, you can easily control the lights via most voice assistants and Matter-compatible apps, in addition to Nanoleaf\u2019s app over Wi-Fi and Bluetooth and remote.\nNanoleaf says the new lights also integrate with other Nanoleaf products. That means you can group them with your indoor lights and automate them with schedules via the Matter app. The lights also come with a new set of preset lighting scenes, in addition to the thousands of other scenes available in the Nanoleaf app.\nWhile the outdoor lights may have stolen the spotlight, the Skylight Smart Modular Ceiling Light once again captured some attention this year. After first introducing the fixture at CES 2023, Nanoleaf finally shared that the ceiling light will be available later this month.\nDesigned to mimic a roof skylight, the square LED ceiling panels come with preset scenes like \u201cGentle Rain\u201d or \u201cSun Shower\u201d and work with Matter. Like Nanoleaf\u2019s wall panels, they can also change colors and sync with sound but are hardwired. The three-pack Smarter Kit is available for preorder now from\u00a0go.nanoleaf.me for $249.99, while the expansion packs start at $69.99.\nRelated\nNanoleaf introduced a couple of other new products and capabilities during this year\u2019s CES. The company unveiled its first color-changing addressable indoor light strip, the Smart Multicolor Lightstrip. Like the outdoor lights, they also work with Matter and will be available in the spring.\nLast but not least, Nanoleaf also introduced its new Orchestrator software. The music visualizer software allows for customizable, colorful light shows that respond intelligently to music. In contrast, Nanoleaf\u2019s current Rhythm feature only reacts to sound as opposed to details like a song\u2019s beat or melody. Scheduled to be released this spring, the software will also be compatible with all streaming music platforms and audio players.\nMicrosoft lays off 1,900 Activision Blizzard and Xbox employees\nTrolls have flooded X with graphic Taylor Swift AI fakes\nNetflix is turning into cable TV\nGoogle\u2019s latest Pixel feature drop adds Circle to Search, Magic Compose, and more\nPorsche\u2019s second-ever EV will be an electric Macan SUV, starting at $80,450\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nTP-Link\u2019s new video door lock unlocks with a tap of your iPhone\nAll the CES highlights so far.\nMovano\u2019s smart ring is the rare CES health gadget that will actually ship\nI watched the Matic robo vac suck up a glass of milk.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Nanoleaf's CES 2024 reveals showcased its effort to enhance the smart lighting experience, with a focus on music synchronization, outdoor lighting, and its much-anticipated Skylight Modular Ceiling Light.\nOrchestrator Software Takes Music Synchronization to New Heights\nOne of the highlights of Nanoleaf's CES 2024 announcements was the introduction of its Orchestrator software. This innovative software promises to revolutionize the way smart lights sync with music.\nUnlike traditional systems that rely solely on sound input from nearby microphones, Orchestrator connects directly to a computer's sound source for a more accurate and dynamic lighting performance. This technology allows Nanoleaf products to react not only to beats but also to melodies and audio spectrum, creating a more immersive and tailored lighting experience.\nOrchestrator is set to be accessible through the Nanoleaf Desktop App and will support all major music streaming platforms. It is expected to launch in the spring of this year.\nExpanded Matter Essentials Line\nNanoleaf's CES 2024 presentation revealed that it has also expanded its Matter Essentials line by introducing three new smart lighting products with Matter support. The Smart Multicolor Lightstrip (Indoor), Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights, and Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights are all part of this expansion.\nThese products are designed to seamlessly integrate with the rest of the Nanoleaf ecosystem and support Matter, making them compatible with various smart home platforms like Apple HomeKit, Amazon Alexa, Google Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings.\nThe Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights, in particular, offer a versatile outdoor lighting solution, perfect for decorating patios, balconies, or decks. These lights are scheduled for release in the spring of 2024.\nSkylight Modular Ceiling Light: Shipping Now\nNanoleaf's CES 2024 presentation also provided an update on its Skylight Modular Ceiling Light, initially introduced at CES 2023. The Skylight is a unique ceiling light fixture designed to mimic the appearance of a skylight. It offers various lighting experiences, including scenes like \"Gentle Rain\" and \"Sun Shower,\" and can be programmed to activate different scenes throughout the day to enhance wake-up and bedtime routines.\nThe Skylight Modular Ceiling Light is now available for shipping, with preorders currently open. The Smarter Kit is priced at $250, while expansion packs can be purchased for $70 each.\nConnecting Outdoor Lighting with Matter Compatibility\nNanoleaf's foray into outdoor lighting marks a significant step forward for the company. With the introduction of the Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights and Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights, Nanoleaf aims to compete in the outdoor lighting market. These lights are designed to provide color-changing and addressable outdoor lighting solutions, allowing users to create dynamic outdoor displays.\nBoth outdoor lights are Matter-compatible, ensuring easy integration with popular smart home platforms. They can be controlled through voice assistants, the Nanoleaf app, and Matter-compatible apps, offering flexibility and convenience for users.\nNanoleaf's commitment to innovation and product diversity was evident at CES 2024. The introduction of the Orchestrator software promises to elevate the music synchronization experience for smart lighting enthusiasts, offering a more accurate and customizable lighting show that reacts to every aspect of music.\nFurthermore, the availability of the Skylight Modular Ceiling Light provides consumers with an elegant and versatile lighting solution for their homes. With the addition of outdoor lighting options, Nanoleaf is expanding its presence in the smart lighting market and offering more choices to consumers looking to enhance their living spaces with dynamic and customizable lighting solutions.\nAs these products and software updates become available throughout the year, Nanoleaf continues to establish itself as a leading player in the smart lighting industry, catering to the evolving needs of its customers.\nRelated posts:\nSubscribe To Home Theater Review\nRecent\nTrending\nAdvertise with UsCustomer Support Editorial Policy Award Licensing"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Nanoleaf Debuts Matter-Enabled Outdoor Lights and New Music Feature, Accepts Pre-Orders for Skylight\nPopular smart lighting company Nanoleaf today announced the launch of several new Matter-enabled lighting options, including its first outdoor lights. The company is also debuting a new music feature and accepting pre-orders for the Nanoleaf Skylight.\nNanoleaf's Matter-enabled lights include the Smart Multicolor Lightstrip, the Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights, and the Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights. The Outdoor String Lights feature large bulbs for decorating a front entryway, patio, or deck, while the permanent lights are designed to be installed under the eaves of a house in lieu of holiday string lights.\nThe Matter lights from Nanoleaf are HomeKit compatible and can be controlled using the Nanoleaf app, the Home app, or Siri voice commands. They support more than 16 million colors and several shades of white, and can be used with all of the Nanoleaf lighting scenes and app customization features.\nTo go along with the lights, Nanoleaf announced new Orchestrator software for the Nanoleaf Desktop App, which will use real-time music analysis to create light shows that match with the beat. Orchestrator is able to connect directly with the sound source of a computer for a more accurate real-time audio visual experience.\nCompared to the Rhythm feature that reacts to sound, Orchestrator is designed to react to music. It can separate beats, melodies, and audio spectrum, timing the light activation to the songs that are playing.\nBoth the new Matter-enabled lights and the Orchestrator will be available in the spring, but Nanoleaf is accepting pre-orders for the Skylight first announced at CES 2023. The Skylight is a square-shaped modular ceiling light panel setup that is hardwired and supports up to 100 squares.\nNanoleaf's Skylight offers millions of color options like other Nanoleaf panels, and it can be controlled via the Nanoleaf app and the Home app. There are special scenes like Gentle Rain and Sun Shower, plus support for the Rhythm Music Visualizer. Each panel offers 1400 lumens of light.\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight can be pre-ordered from the Nanoleaf website for $250 for three panels, with an additional panel expansion pack available for $70.\nGet weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.\nTop Rated Comments\nPopular Stories\nApple Releases watchOS 10.3 With New Watch Face\nApple Releases tvOS 17.3\nApple Releases Updated Firmware for First-Generation AirPods Pro and AirPods 2\nNew iPad Air, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air Models Likely to Launch in March or April\nHere's What Apple Vision Pro's Huge Box Looks Like\niPhone 7 Users in U.S. Could Receive Up to $349 Payment From Apple\niPhone 16 Pro Max Rumored to Feature Bigger, More Advanced Main Camera Sensor\nNext Article\nGuides\nOur comprehensive guide highlighting every major new addition in iOS 17, plus how-tos that walk you through using the new features.\nStolen Device Protection, collaborative Apple Music playlists, AirPlay to hotel TVs, and more.\nGet the most out your iPhone 15 with our complete guide to all the new features.\nA deep dive into new features in macOS Sonoma, big and small.\nUpcoming\nThe Apple Vision Pro AR/VR headset is available to pre-order now in the U.S., with a launch coming on February 2.

        "raw_content": "Nanoleaf upgrades its music-syncing skills, launches new lighting products at CES 2024\nNanoleaf lit up the stage at CES 2024, pulling back the curtain on a variety of new lighting products arriving later this year. Along with the Essentials Matter Smart Multicolor Lightstrip, Outdoor String Lights, and Permanent Outdoor Lights, the company gave fans a closer look at the upcoming Skylight Modular Ceiling Light and the Orchestrator software \u2014 with the latter bringing massive improvements to Nanoleaf\u2019s music syncing abilities.\nOrchestrator is arguably the most exciting innovation of the bunch, as it connects directly to your computer\u2019s sound source to create a highly accurate lighting performance. This allows your Nanoleaf products to create a light show that\u2019s more robust than most other products on the market, which rely on sound alone.\nNanoleaf says the software \u201cpicks up on beats, melodies, and audio spectrum\u201d to craft a unique performance for each song, and it will be accessible via the Nanoleaf Desktop App with support for all music streaming platforms. It\u2019s expected to launch this spring.\nAlong with Orchestrator, three products in the Essentials lineup made an appearance at CES 2024 \u2014 the Smart Multicolor Lightstrip (Indoor), Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights, and Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights. All of these support Matter and will easily sync with the rest of the Nanoleaf library.\nNanoleaf rounded out CES 2024 by giving an update on its Skylight Modular Ceiling Light, which first debuted at last year\u2019s event. The intriguing ceiling light supports a variety of lighting experiences, including Scenes like \u201cGentle Rain\u201d and \u201cSun Shower.\u201d The light can be controlled remotely, and it can also be programmed to activate various scenes throughout the day to help you wake up in the morning or fall asleep at night.\nThe Nanoleaf Essentials products are expected to arrive in spring, but pricing details have yet to be announced. The Skylight is shipping later this month, with preorders now open for $250. Expansion kits are also available for $70.\nAnker showed off several products at CES 2024, but few were as compelling as the Solix F3800 Portable Power Station. With a staggering 6,000W output (and the option to chain two together for 12,000W), it's shaping up to be a portable power station that can tackle every task around your home, garage, or campsite.\nThe Solix F3800 is designed as an all-encompassing solution for portable power. Its output allows it to power RVs, directly charge EVs, and run home appliances like your microwave and refrigerator. Along with its 6,000W output, it benefits from up to a 53.8kwh capacity; in other words, it should have more than enough juice to run your gadgets before it needs to recharge itself.\nSamsung SmartThings -- an application designed to connect and control your smart home devices -- doesn't quite get the same attention as platforms like Google Home or Apple HomeKit. However, it made some big announcements at CES 2024, and it's shaping up to be a big year for Samsung's first-party platform. Along with enhanced support for TVs and new uses for QR codes, SmartThings is rolling out a brilliant Map View feature, which creates a digital map of your home and shows you exactly where all your connected devices are located.\nHere's how it works. Instead of scrolling through a list of all your devices or jumping between groups in your smartphone app, Map View lets you see a 3D representation of your home on your smartphone. Inside this map, you'll find icons for all your smart home gadgets corresponding to their actual physical location. That means you can quickly find exactly which device you want to control without needing to scroll through a long list.\nSamsung unleashed a flurry of announcements at CES 2024, including several upcoming smart home appliances powered by AI. The lineup features an induction cooktop, washer and dryer combo, slide-in range, and refrigerator, all of which use new A.I. features to streamline your daily chores.\nThe Samsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator was among the first reveals, debuting ahead of CES 2024. Featuring the premium AI Family Hub+ and AI Vision Inside, the futuristic fridge can scan and identify 33 different types of food items and send you alerts before they expire.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nNanoleaf debuts outdoor lights at CES, but no \u201clearning\u201d lights\nNanoleaf has long trumpeted the idea of smart lights that actually live up to the name, and at last year\u2019s CES, the manufacturer announced a new series of \u201clearning\u201d lights that pick up your habits over time. But while Nanoleaf has other smart lights to unwrap at CES 2024, the promised Sense+ Controls line isn\u2019t among them.\nWhat Nanoleaf does have on hand for this year\u2019s CES is a trio of new Matter-enabled Essentials lights, including the company\u2019s first outdoor lights, while the ceiling-mountable Skylight panels that missed a Q3 2023 launch window will finally ship later this month.\nNanoleaf is also touting a new feature for its Nanoleaf Desktop app that precisely syncs your Nanoleaf lights with music or other audio from your PC or Mac.\nBut those new products are overshadowed by the absence of the Nanoleaf Sense+ Controls line and the intelligent \u201cNala\u201d learning bridge, which Nanoleaf promoted at last year\u2019s CES as the \u201cworld\u2019s first ever hands-free smart lighting experience\u201d for homes.\nOriginally due to arrive in the fall of 2023, the Sense+ Controls line consists of three products, including two smart light switches and the wireless Nala learning bridge, which is designed to monitor your habits and create \u201cpersonalized\u201d and \u201cpredictive\u201d automations for a \u201ctruly intelligent and hands-free experience.\u201d The Nala learning bridge sits in a night light, which also acts as a Thread border router for Matter.\nThe Nanoleaf Sense+ Controls line and the intelligent \u201cNala\u201d learning bridge (pictured) were announced at last year\u2019s CES, but there\u2019s no sign of them at this year\u2019s show.\nNanoleaf\nNanoleaf has been talking about such \u201clearning\u201d lights for years, starting with a never-released \u201cLearning Series\u201d of intelligent lights, buttons, and switches\u00a0that would have acted as a \u201csensory network\u201d for detecting motion and ambient light.\nNanoleaf first announced the Learning Series back at CES 2020 for a 2021 ship date. That never happened, with the Learning Series presumably having morphed into the Sense+ Controls line.\nThe whole \u201clearning\u201d lights concept is an intriguing one, and very much in line with Nanoleaf CEO Gimmy Chu\u2019s stated desire to \u201cget smart lighting to be actually smart\u201d rather than just \u201ca glorified remote control.\u201d\nThat\u2019s a laudable goal, but will these mold-breaking learning lights ever ship? We\u2019re starting to wonder, especially given that the Sense+ Controls line didn\u2019t even rate a mention in Nanoleaf\u2019s CES 2024 pre-brief materials.\nAsked about the fate of Sense+ Controls, a Nanoleaf rep replied that the series is \u201cplanned for release this year,\u201d adding that the company has been \u201cworking hard behind the scenes to create the best possible experience with this new product line.\u201d Well, let\u2019s hope so.\nMeanwhile, the ceiling-mountable Skylight line of light panels that were first announced at CES 2023 will now ship in late January (missing the original Q3 2023 launch window), Nanoleaf announced, but its promised Sense+ light-sensing capabilities will remain dormant until the full series of Sense+ Controls products arrives.\nNanoleaf\u2019s ceiling-mounted Skylight light panels are now slated to arrive later this month.\nNanoleaf\nThe square-shaped, flush-mounted Skylight panels ($249.99 for a three-piece \u201cSmarter\u201d kit, or $69.99 for a one-piece expansion kit) will be able to glow in up to 16 million colors, same as Nanoleaf\u2019s other smart lights, and you\u2019ll be able to incorporate Skylight installations in lighting scenes and routines. The first Skylight panel you mount must be hardwired to power, but you\u2019ll then be able to connect up to 100 more panels to the first one without additional wiring.\nI\u2019m told that Skylight won\u2019t work with Matter, or at least not initially. (A Matter update for Skylight \u201cmay\u201d arrive eventually, Nanoleaf says.)\nAlso coming soon are three Matter-enabled products from Nanoleaf\u2019s Essentials line: a five-meter\u00a0indoor Smart Multicolor Lightstrip, Multicolor Outdoor String Lights (15 meters), and Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights, the latter being a series of puck-style lights attached to a 30-meter strip.\nNanoleaf revealed few details about the new Essentials lights, which (aside from the indoor-only Smart Multicolor Lightstrip) are the first Nanoleaf products designed for outdoor use.\nWe do know that the Outdoor String Lights and Permanent Outdoor Lights have (respectively) IP65 and IP67 ratings, indicating that they\u2019re dust-tight and should withstand jets of water (or \u201cpowerful\u201d jets, in the case of the Permanent Outdoor Lights)\u00a0from any direction.\nNanoleaf\u2019s Permanent Outdoor Lights work with Matter and have an IP67 rating, meaning they\u2019re dust-tight and can weather powerful water jets.\nNanoleaf\nThe new Essentials lights are due to ship this spring, with pricing to be announced closer to the ship date.\nFinally, Nanoleaf has announced the music-syncing Orchestrator, which will arrive this spring in an update to the Nanoleaf Desktop software.\nUnlike Nanoleaf\u2019s Rhythm mode, which uses a built-in microphone to sync the beat of nearby music sources with your Nanoleaf lights, Orchestrator works directly with the audio card on your PC or Mac, employing its \u201cSmarter\u201d technology to deliver \u201cthe most accurate real-time audio-visual experience,\u201d Nanoleaf says.\nWe\u2019ll have reviews of Nanoleaf\u2019s new Essentials light and Orchestrator once we get some hands-on time\u2014and in the meantime, we\u2019ll be keeping an eye out for those long-awaired Sense+ Controls products.\nAuthor: Ben Patterson, Senior Writer\nBen has been writing about technology and consumer electronics for more than 20 years.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nNanoleaf reveals its first-ever outdoor smart lights at CES 2024\nThe brand has also revealed its new music visualiser software and launched the highly anticipated Skylight Modular Ceiling Light\nNow CES 2024 has officially kicked off, there is going to be a huge amount of talk regarding new products, software updates and releases. You may be holding out for something you've suspected is coming, or you might just be interested in the latest tech news. Either way, we hope you're as excited as we are. On that note, one huge smart lighting release is in and we're ecstatic to be able to share it with you.\nNanoleaf, a global leader in smart lighting innovation and design, has today announced brand new colour and lighting experiences for the entire home. Nanoleaf\u2019s new Orchestrator software and three Matter-compatible smart lights will be shown for the first time at CES 2024, all designed to enhance musical experiences, entertainment areas, and day-to-day smart home automations. The company is also announcing the pre-order launch for the highly anticipated Skylight Modular Ceiling Light.\nBefore you find out more, have you seen the 5 smart home products we're excited to see in 2024?\n1. Nanoleaf Orchestrator\u00a0Software\nNanoleaf\u2019s new Orchestrator software transforms your experience with music like never before, creating captivating colour and light shows with unmatched real-time music analysis and beat detection. Unlike many existing music visualisers, Orchestrator connects directly with your computer\u2019s sound source and isolates the response to your device for the most accurate real-time audio visual experience. The result is dynamic light shows perfectly synchronised and designed for each of your personal playlists and favourite songs.\nWhilst Nanoleaf\u2019s current Rhythm feature reacts to sound, the new Orchestrator technology will intelligently respond to your\u00a0music. With Nanoleaf\u2019s advanced 'Smarter' Technology, Orchestrator picks up on beats, melodies, and audio spectrum to generate mesmerising visuals with unparalleled precision and automatically curates every aspect of your musical lightshow.\nEnergetic beats will be brought to life with pulsating light reactions, whilst slower more melodic songs gently dance across your wall with synchronised animations. Users can also choose to create the light shows themselves by customising their own unique palettes, effects and more.\nOrchestrator works via the Nanoleaf Desktop App and is compatible with any music streaming platform or audio player. The software is planned for a spring 2024 release.\n2. Nanoleaf Matter-Compatible Smart Lights\nSmart Multicolour Indoor Lightstrip\nNanoleaf is also announcing three new colour-changing addressable smart lights to work with Matter: a Smart Multicolour Indoor Lightstrip, Smart Multicolour Outdoor String Lights and Smart Multicolour Permanent Outdoor Lights. The new outdoor additions to the Essentials Matter line mark the company\u2019s first ever outdoor lighting products, bringing the magic of dynamic gradients and warm ambience to your home\u2019s exterior spaces, lighting up patio areas, backyards and gardens all year round.\nSmart Multicolour Permanent Outdoor Lights\nBuilt with Nanoleaf\u2019s exclusive technology, the new smart addressable lighting additions to the Essentials line seamlessly integrate with other Nanoleaf products for simple controls and smart customisations. Users can group products together for easy automations with their Matter hubs, and paint individual animations so\u00a0multiple colours can appear all at once. The lights will also come with a new collection of preset lighting Scenes, along with access to thousands of additional Scenes in the Nanoleaf App.\nThe Nanoleaf Essentials Matter line allows for simple control via Matter, or directly via the Nanoleaf App through Wi-Fi or Bluetooth. Users also have the option to control their lights with voice control or the easy access Manual Controller, for times when they prefer to go without their device.\nAll three smart lighting products are planned for a spring 2024 release.\nSmart Multicolour Outdoor String Lights\n3. Nanoleaf Skylight Smart Modular Ceiling Light\nSkylight Smart Modular Ceiling Light\nFirst previewed at CES 2023, Nanoleaf is excited to announce the official launch of Skylight, the world's first ever smart modular ceiling light panels with full design customisations. Skylight uniquely blends functional everyday lighting with creativity and personal expression, highlighting Nanoleaf\u2019s continued commitment to fusing elevated design with technology.\nSkylight features a flush-mounted modular square design with diffused multi-point lighting, creating a soft and natural lighting experience. Users can seamlessly adjust colours and set scenes such as Gentle Rain or Sun Shower, perfect for setting whatever ambience you desire. Users can even control the Skylight remotely for an added security measure when away from home, or schedule automatic on/off at desired times.\nHard-wire one square, and then add up to 100 additional squares across the ceiling to create your own designs using the moqdular set up.

Each square emits 1400 lumens of light with a lifespan of 25,000 hours and is built with Nanoleaf\u2019s full suite of smart features. Users can control the setup via the Nanoleaf App, smart home ecosystem or with a traditional lightswitch.\nNanoleaf Skylight is now available for pre-order\u00a0and retails for $249.99 for the Smarter Kit (3PK) and $69.99 for Expansion Packs (1PK).\nThe product will ship late January 2024.\nCaught your attention?

Skylight \u201cuniquely blends functional everyday lighting with creativity and personal expression.\u201d\nSkylight itself features a flush-mounted square design with dispersed multi-point lighting, ensuring that the light is evenly spread across the size of the square and creating a soft lighting environment that feels as natural as possible. You will be able to seamlessly adjust the colours and Scenes, such as ones called \u201cGentle Rain\u201d or \u201cSun Shower,\u201d to set your ideal ambiance for morning and evening routines in the bedroom or for times of focus in the home office.\nSchedules allow the user to \u201cwake up to a gentle sunrise Scene filled with soft oranges and pinks to help energize you\u00a0in the mornings, and ease yourself to sleep as you lay under a glimmering star effect when winding down for the evening.\u201d These schedules can also be used as an added form of home security when travelling or just away for the night, as they can be turned on and off at specific times.\nSet up for the Nanoleaf Skylight is as simple as hard-wiring the first square and then adding up to 100 additional squares on the ceiling to create whatever kind of design you can think of, as the squares are modular and can be placed as you see fit. According to Nanoleaf, each square will emit 1400 lumens of light and carry a lifespan of 25,000 hours.\nSkylight, which was built with all of Nanoleaf\u2019s full suite of smart features (Rhythm Music Visualizer, Magic Scenes, RGBW colour options, etc.), can also be controlled with the Nanoleaf app via Wi-Fi, your existing smart home ecosystem (Google, Alexa, etc.) or with your traditional existing light switch on the wall.\nNanoleaf had other products to announce as well, with new products with Matter and Orchestrator on the way. Orchestrator is a brand-new software for music visualization that boasts real-time music analysis and beat detection. This is done by connecting directly to your computer\u2019s sound source and isolating the response to your device to provide the most accurate real-time audio-visual experience.\nThe Matter ecosystem, on the other hand, will be featuring a new collection of three colour-changing addressable smart lights: a Smart Multicolour Lightstrip (indoor), Smart Multicolour Outdoor String Lights, and Smart Multicolour Permanent Outdoor Lights. These three products are Nanoleaf\u2018s first foray into the outdoor lighting market, and they hope to bring warm ambience and dynamic gradients to your home\u2019s outdoor living spaces the whole year round.\nKeep up to date on everything CES 2024 here.\nThis post may contain affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "Nanoleaf debuts new Matter compatible smart lights at CES 2024\nAt CES 2024, Nanoleaf has debuted new Matter compatible smart lights designed for the home. This includes the indoor Essentials Matter Smart Multicolor Lightstrip, Outdoor String Lights, and Permanent Outdoor Lights. The company has also announced that they are taking pre-orders for the Skylight Modular Ceiling Light which debuted at CES last year.\nNanoleaf Skylight pre-orders\nNanoleaf started out by creating smart LED wall lights, but if you prefer something on your ceiling, the Skylight could be the way to go. The company announced these smart lights were announced at CES 2023 and they are now available for pre-order.\nThe Nanoleaf Skylights are square LED lights which follow a similar concept to the company\u2019s other smart lights. Users will be able to connect up to 100 additional squares to create unique patterns and lighting effects for themselves. The Skylights also feature support for mood lighting, scenes that can change based on the time of day, and also sync with music.\nThey are priced at $249.99 for the Smarter (Starter) Kit and $69.99 for the Expansion Pack.\nNew Matter compatible lights\nAdditionally, alongside the Skylight pre-orders, Nanoleaf has introduced new smart lighting compatible with the Matter protocol.\nMatter is a unified smart home protocol that was designed to enable compatibility among\u00a0 various smart home products regardless of manufacturer or platform. This helps give users more choices when it comes to mixing and matching products, rather than restricting choices based on specific platforms.\nThese new Matter compatible lights include the Smart Multicolor Lightstrip (Indoor), Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights, and Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights. They will all play nicely with existing Nanoleaf products and offer up similar features. They will also be compatible with Matter hubs so that they\u2019ll work with other smart home devices.\nThese new Matter compatible smart lights will be available this coming Spring.\nOrchestrator software\nLast but not least, Nanoleaf has also announced their new Orchestrator software. Nanoleaf\u2019s smart lights are already compatible with music where the lights can sync to the beat.\nWhat makes the Orchestrator software different is that it can actually perform real-time music analysis. This is versus other lighting systems that rely on audio pickup to create visualization effects.\nThe end result are light shows and colors that are more dynamic with varying animation effects that are more suitable based on the mood of the song. Nanoleaf will release the Orchestrator software this Spring, ensuring compatibility with any music streaming service or audio player.\nSamsung Teams up with PDP for Gaming Hub Controller\nJabra\u2019s Elite 8 Active, Elite 10 earbuds will be getting some enhancements in an upcoming update\nThe OSCAL PowerMax 3600 is a power station that\u2019s great for both indoor and outdoor use!\nSamsung could be making a more wallet-friendly Galaxy Z Fold 6\nReports Indicate that Apple Might Charge Devs for Sideloaded Apps\nComments\nLeave a reply Cancel reply\nYour email address will not be published.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nNanoleaf announced new products at CES, but what I'm most interested in is Skylight ceiling lighting\nNanoleaf provides even more ways to get your home lit just the way you want it.\nWhat you need to know\nToday during the first day of CES 2024, the smart light company, Nanoleaf, revealed new ways to experience its smart lighting offerings, but one of these has caught my attention far more than the others. So what all was announced? First off, there's the new Nanoleaf Orchestrator software which works better than the current Nanoleaf Rhythm software to detect sounds and match pulsing colors to the beat and rhythm. Then there are three new Essentials Matter color-changing smart lights (some for indoor and some for outdoor use) to help you get the exact look you want from various areas of your home.\nLastly, (and in my opinion most importantly) there's the new Nanoleaf Skylight, modular ceiling lighting that can help each room get the exact vibe you're looking for.\u00a0You can learn more about each of these Nanoleaf reveals below and learn why exactly I'm so excited about Skylight.\nSkylight modular ceiling lights provide the lighting effects I've been waiting for\nUp until now, Nanoleaf has mostly focused on modular wall lighting, lighting strips, and light bulbs. But now, the company has revealed something completely new that I am actually really stoked about. Nanoleaf Skylight is a flush-mounted square modular lighting kit that attaches to your ceiling rather than your wall so you can add color and brightness to a room from a more natural angle.\nWhat's more, the lighting is soft and you can set preset effects from your phone such as \"Sun Shower\" which makes a room warmly lit (and is ideal for waking up), or \"Gentle Rain\" which provides a calming purple-blue lighting effect.\u00a0You can even put these effects on a schedule so that they automatically go from one effect to another at various times.\nNow, Nanoleaf's wall lighting is all well and good for use in my office or video game room. But there's no denying that it casts a harsher, angled shadow on people in the room unless you have enough lights to go on all of the walls and light things from all sides, but that's expensive. This is why I'm very interested in this new ceiling lighting, which will do a better job of lighting the full room with a more natural lighting angle that shines down from above.\nAs with most smart home lighting, Skylight isn't cheap, though, The initial Skylight Smarter Kit is a whopping $249.99 and comes with three modular lights which you can arrange in whatever way you see fit. One of these lights needs to be hardwired and then the rest just need to be connected to that initial light to work. Of course, if you purchase additional expansion packs (1PK for $69.99), you can extend the lighting effects further throughout a room with the possibility of up to 101 module lights connected in total. That many modules will cost you a pretty penny, but it will also make for a pretty effect.\nObviously, I'm not going to be grabbing 101 of these babies (cause I'm not made of money), but I am very interested in installing some over my bed and over my kitchen table. You see, I'm prone to headaches when in the presence of harsh lighting, which can be frustrating during game nights or dinner parties with friends where I want to have plenty of light for my guests to feel comfortable.\nAs such, I've already installed dimmable lighting throughout my home to deal with this issue. However, I'm sure the soft lighting and pleasant effects of Nanoleaf Skylight will be gentler on my sensitive eyes and more convenient to use from my phone than what I've currently got set up. Plus, the idea of setting the lights in my bedroom to change colors gradually and help me wake up in the mornings sounds far more effective than using a small sunrise clock that I might turn away from in the night.\nIf you're interested, Nanoleaf Skylight is already available for preorder and the first shipments are expected to go out in late January 2024.\nNanoleaf Skylight Smarter Kit (3PK): Preorder for $249.99 at Nanoleaf\nAdd flair to the rooms in your home with the brand-new Nanoleaf Skylight Smarter Kit. These are modular lights that you can control from your phone to get the exact brightness and coloring that you want for any area. Additional expansion packs are $69.99.\nNanoleaf Skylight will ship late January 2024.\nNanoleaf Orchestrator software is the smarter way to create real-time lighting responses\nAnother major CES announcement from Nanoleaf this year is Orchestrator, the company's new music reaction software that takes things a step smarter than the current Nanoleaf Rhythm software.\nAs Nanoleaf said in a press release, \"Unlike existing music visualizers today which merely pick up on any audio or sound within a space, Orchestrator connects directly with your computer\u2019s sound source and isolates the response to your device for the most accurate real-time audio visual experience.\" The press release goes on to explain that, \"The result is dynamic light shows perfectly synchronized and designed for each of your personal playlists and favorite songs.\"\nOrchestrator is planned to release sometime in Spring 2024 and will work with the Nanoleaf Desktop App while being \"compatible with any streaming platform or audio player.\" That way, you should be able to get it to work with whatever music service or program that you prefer.\nNanoleaf finally releases its first outdoor lighting products and expands Matter-compatible light line\nThe last thing Nanoleaf announced at CES this year is its addition of three new Matter-compatible lights. Nanoleaf's compatible Matter products include everything from light bulbs and recessed downlights to lighting strips that can be customized right from your phone with over 16 million colors and various effects. But now, the company is continuing to expand its Essentials Matter compatible line with the addition of three new products \u2014 Indoor lighting strips, outdoor string lights, and permanent outdoor multicolor lights.\n- Best Nanoleaf smart lights\n- Best LED lighting for PCs\n- Nanoleaf is one of the best smart lights\nIt's also worth noting that these are the first outdoor lighting products that Nanoleaf has ever produced. That way you can get your patio, apartment balcony, or gazebo area lit up just the way you like.\nAs the Nanoleaf website explains, Matter is a program that unifies your system so that \"all of your devices can finally play nice\" together. In other words, you can get the beautiful lighting you want throughout your home even if the lighting you're using wasn't initially intended to work with other lighting.\nAs such, these latest Nanoleaf Essential Matter lighting options sync with other Nanoleaf Matter lighting products and can be controlled with the Nanoleaf App using Bluetooth or Wi-Fi. The new Nanoleaf Essentials Matter devices are expected to release sometime in Spring 2024.\nCES 2024 runs from Jan. 7 through Jan. 12 this year and we at Windows Central will be here to cover additional announcements going forward so check back to get the latest news.\nGet the Windows Central Newsletter\nAll the latest news, reviews, and guides for Windows and Xbox diehards.\nSelf-professed gaming geek, Rebecca Spear, is one of Windows Central's gaming editors with a focus on gaming handhelds, PC gaming, and laptops.

        "raw_content": "Nanoleaf Showcases its Modular Skylight and Three Matter-Compatible Lights at CES 2024\nToronto-based smart light company Nanoleaf has revealed a series of new products and software during CES 2024. This includes the previously announced Skylight, which is now available for preorder.\nSkylight\nNanoleaf is continuing to expand its catalogue, heading into 2024. The arrival of its modular ceiling light dubbed Skylight, comes after the lighting array was previously teased during Nanoleaf Live in 2023. Skylight is a flush-mounted ceiling light with a modern and modular design. It incorporates a diffused multi-point lighting system creating a soft and natural light within the home.\nUsers can adjust its colours and Scenes, including \u2018Gentle Rain\u2019 and \u2018Sun Shower\u2019, setting the appropriate atmosphere throughout the day. In addition, Skylight can support adjusted lighting throughout the day, automated for routines. This includes gentle sunrise lighting as you wake up or a calming transition to blue lighting during the evening. With Schedules, users can set even more automation, including when the lights turn on and off. Remote access is also available, letting users turn the lights on or off, adding security when away from the home.\nSkylight is comprised of one hard-wired square. Users then have the option to add up to 100 additional squares across their ceiling. They can then create their designs, patterns, and layouts across their home. Each square can render 1,400 lumens with an expected lifespan of 25,000 hours.\nA three-pack Skylight set is available to preorder now for $349.99 in Canada. Each Expansion Pack is available for $99.99. Nanoleaf Skylight is expected to begin shipping in \u201clate January 2024.\u201d\nNanoleaf Essential Indoor and Outdoor\nNanoleaf revealed three new colour-changing Matter-enabled lights. During CES 2024, Nanoleaf detailed its Smart Multicolor Lightstrip (Indoor), Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights and Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights. The latter two are the first-ever outdoor lighting products under the Essentials Matter lineup. They can be placed across backyards, patios, and gardens from summer to winter.\nWith Nanoleaf expanding its Essentials Matter line for the outdoors, users can set up lighting arrays and control them alongside all other products. This includes setting various animations, colour patterns, and more. The new lights also come with a new collection of preset lighting Scenes, adding to the thousands that are already available in the Nanoleaf app.\nThe Smart Multicolor Lightstrip (Indoor), Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights and Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights will all be available later this spring, Nanoleaf confirms. Pricing has yet to be disclosed.\nNanoleaf Orchestrator\nAside from new products, Nanoleaf revealed its Orchestrator software. The innovation connects directly to the user\u2019s computer sound source, isolating the response to your device. It then can render an accurate real-time audio-visual experience across compatible lighting. Orchestrator can analyze the beats and rhythm of the user\u2019s personal playlists and favourite songs. It\u2019s all done via the software\u2019s advanced \u201cSmarter\u201d tech, creating a personalized light show. Users can also create their light shows by customizing unique pallets and effects.\nNanoleaf Orchestrator is compatible with the Nanoleaf Desktop app and any music streaming service, including Spotify and Apple Music. The software is expected to launch in the spring of 2024.\nOther articles in the category: News\nMac Users Report Auto-Update to macOS Sonoma Without Consent\nMicrosoft Mesh for Virtual Collaborations Now Available in Teams\nMeta Implements Stricter Message Settings for Teens on Instagram, Facebook\nInfo\nStay in touch!"

Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\nIn the world of smart lighting and smart home technology, CES is a big affair, acting as our first preview of what\u2019s to come in the following year. This year, CES 2024 is happening right now in Las Vegas, Nevada, and it\u2019s off to an exciting start with a strong showing of debut smart lighting.\nAs always, our team of editors is on the ground at CES, getting a first glimpse of offerings like GE Lighting\u2019s under-cabinet fixtures, the new edition of the Neon Rope Light, and new Matter compatible lights from Nanoleaf.\nCES 2024: The best new smart lighting and smart light bulbs\nGovee Neon Rope Light 2\nShape your light, and your lighting.\nThe Neon Rope Light 2 reimagines a preexisting Govee product, the Neon Rope Light. We reviewed the previous model and appreciated its intuitive, customizable design and smart features.\nAs with the previous model, the Rope Light 2 is capable of displaying millions of colors. But it also improves on the original design with smoother effects, a better flexing material, and new app features in the Govee Home App. This includes shape recognition through your device's camera.\nWe\u2019re excited to try the Neon Rope Light 2 and see if its new features truly bring it to the next level.\nWhile Govee doesn't give an exact date for the release of the Neon Rope Light 2, it should be available soon.\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nSync your smart lights with the media you love.\nWhat if you could sync smart lighting and entertainment through one hub? The Govee AI Sync Box Kit 2 is built for just this, using AI to recognize and augment moments in your gaming and home entertainment with the help of smart lights like the Govee Glide Hexa Light Panels.\nThe hub connects video and lighting signals, and can match lighting schemes to 4K 120Hz gameplay.

These cabinet lights should play well with other GE Cync lights you might already own, such as the GE Cync Dynamic Effects Smart Hexagon Panels.\nThe permanent or semi-permanent fixtures can be installed via plug or hardwire. They will be available later on in 2024 at Lowes,\nTarget, and Amazon for approximately $60.\nU-tec Bright Wi-Fi Mesh Smart Lighting Bulb Without Hub\nMake any lamp into a smart light.\nA bulb with excellent control, the U-tec Bright Wi-Fi Mesh Smart Lighting Bulb supplies bright color modulating light and Wi-Fi mesh connectivity without requiring a hub.\nThis mesh connectivity means that only one bulb connects to your wifi\u2014all other bulbs connect to that first bulb.
