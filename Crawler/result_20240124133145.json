        "raw_content": "Samsung\u2019s 2024 TVs are bigger and packed with AI and accessibility features\nIf 2023 was the year of ultra-bright TVs, then 2024 is shaping up to be the year we see AI features burrow their way into them more than ever. Today at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, Samsung let loose some of the details on its much-anticipated lineup of its Neo QLED and OLED TVs for the year, and we\u2019ll have to wait for pricing and availability, but we can confirm that it\u2019s doubled down on AI to help make things look better, sound clearer, and get more customized to what you\u2019re watching.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K lineup\n8K TVs still suffer from not having much content out there to watch on them, but that hasn\u2019t stopped the big TV brands from pushing the tech forward in anticipation. This year\u2019s 8K lineup of Neo QLED mini-LEDs from Samsung includes two models, the QN800D and QN900D, both of which will be available in 65- to 85-inch models.\nAgain, details were a bit sparse at the time of this writing, but in a press release from Samsung, the company outlined improved sound and enhanced design, calling the QN900D Neo QLED the slimmest 8K TV ever to hit the market. That, and both new QLED 8K models are getting a processor upgrade to something called the NQA AI Gen3 that Samsung says features an on-device AI engine that is twice as fast as its predecessor and with eight times the neural networks.\nThis new AI brain is driving some new smart features built into the 8K Neo QLEDS, but the Samsung CES 2024 press release only outlines the following new features specifically with regards to the QN900D, but it\u2019s possible they will apply to both it and the QN800D and we\u2019ll update as we learn.\nFor now, the QN900D features something called AI Upscaling Pro that can upscale SD and HD content to 4K resolution as well as take 4K content to 8K. AI is also taking the lead in making gaming, sports, and fast-paced action movies clearer and smoother with AI Motion Enhancer Pro. For sports, for example, Samsung says the feature can even track a specific kind of ball depending on the sport you\u2019re watching \u2014 no more blurry pucks or footballs whizzing across the screen. Samsung has also improved its Real Depth Enhancer to Real Depth Enhancer Pro, which focuses on the clarity and contrast of objects on screen while also maintaining the background.\nGamers will also take particular interest in the QN900D\u2019s ability to support 240Hz VRR (variable refresh rate) for smoother, faster gaming without having to cut resolution, which is huge.\nSamsung\u2019s One Connect Box has gotten a redesign, too, opting for a new U-shaped layout that\u2019s more compact than its predecessor. For those who don\u2019t know, the One Connect Box lets you connect all your devices, such as streaming boxes, DVD players, and gaming consoles, so you can more easily keep all the cables hidden while one cable connects cleanly to your TV. We\u2019re curious to see the new box in the flesh at the show.\nOther features to look out for with the QN900D include a new, slimmer \u201cInfinity Air Stand\u201d and the Now+ feature that lets you utilize the TV when it\u2019s off as an information hub for things like weather, notes to the family, widgets, and more.\nSamsung Neo QLED 4K lineup\nOn the 4K front for Samsung\u2019s Neo QLED lineup, we have two new contenders. First is the Neo QLED QN90D, the 2024 version of last year\u2019s excellent QN90C, but this year it\u2019s being offered in a huge 98-inch size. The QN85C has also gotten a letter bump to the QN85D, but it\u2019s kept the same size lineup at 55- to 85-inches, which is also nothing to sneeze at. Again, details were a little sparse at press time, and we\u2019ll obviously have more, but for now, all we know is that the new Neo QLED 4K mini-LED TVs feature an updated Neural Quantum Processor, 4K upscaling, and they also get the upgraded Real Depth Enhancer Pro feature.\nSamsung OLED lineup\nSamsung\u2019s quantum-dot OLEDs have gained a lot of praise and attention in the last couple of years, and for good reason \u2014 they have excellently inky black levels like traditional OLEDs but are also great in bright rooms with some stunning contrast. Last year\u2019s Samsung S95C topped our list of best TVs for much of the year and is still one to beat, as far as we\u2019re concerned. For 2024, the Samsung OLEDs have moved up the alphabet with the S95D (available in 55 to 77 inches) and the S90D, which, curiously, has dropped the 83-inch version that it added to the S90C model last summer, to now just offering it in 55- to 77-inch models, as well.\nWith that all out of the way, we can likely expect Samsung\u2019s OLEDs to build on last year\u2019s primo specs, but new on tap for this year, Samsung says, is a first for OLEDs \u2014 a Glare-Free technology in the S95D (perhaps in the S90D, too, but we don\u2019t know yet) that builds on Samsung\u2019s already stellar anti-glare but is said to go even further. We\u2019ll wait to see it for ourselves, but Samsung claims that it will be great in both low light and brighter rooms, won\u2019t be affected by viewing angles, and won\u2019t mess with contrast or colors either.\nThe S95D maintains its thin, 11-mm, flat-back profile, support for 144Hz VRR for gamers, and is also available with the One Connect Box, although the release doesn\u2019t specifically say whether it\u2019s the redesigned u-shape version; we\u2019ll have to see. And while the S95C\u2019s sound didn\u2019t blow us away, this year, Samsung says it\u2019s made enhancements to the S95D\u2019s built-in speaker distribution that it says will reward you with \u201cTrue Channel Dolby Atmos for even more cinematic\nsurround sound,\u201d which is just marketing speak, meaning that\u00a0its side, bottom, and top speaker placements, the Atmos effect should be better than with TVs that only have bottom/top speakers.\nActive Voice Amplifier Pro and other TV features\nIn 2024, Samsung, like many of its competitors, is reacting to a widespread complaint that dialogue on our TV and movies at home has been getting harder and harder to hear. Samsung is adding some new features to its 2024 TVs to combat that, including Active Voice Amplifier Pro, which will be available in its Neo QLED 4K, Neo QLED 8K, and OLED TVs. The feature boosts dialogue and sound effects so you can hear them better.\nSamsung is also touting its new Audio Subtitles feature that it says is the world\u2019s first on-device TV service that reads subtitles aloud in real-time. This could be a game changer for the visually impaired, as the system uses a Samsung-created module and text-to-speech software to constantly scan and identify the text on-screen and then read it out loud with what Samsung says is more than 95% accurate. The feature currently supports Korean and English and can be customized for speed and volume.\nWhat about Samsung microLED?\nOne of the big TV technologies that could give OLED a run for its money is microLED, but so far they\u2019ve either been in enormous sizes or come with enormous price tags. Samsung made a big splash at CES 2023 last year announcing its 76-inch microLED TV CX, the smallest in the range announced so far. At CES 2024, the company is showing off the 76-inch model and the 114-inch model fir the first time (as well as the 89-, 101-, 114-, and monster 140-inch models). \u201cMicroLED stands at the pinnacle of display tech, with a variety of models in its lineup spanning 76 to 140 inches,\u201d Samsung told us, while also sharing that new info and availability on its microLED TVs is coming later this year.\nFollow all of our coverage of CES 2024 on Digital Trends.\nIt's a picture frame. It's a speaker. It's the Samsung Music Frame. Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends\nAlong with its new TVs, ultra short throw laser projectors, and soundbars -- most of which were totally predictable enhancements of existing products -- Samsung brought something truly different to CES 2024: the Samsung Music Frame, a Dolby Atmos-capable wireless speaker that doubles as an old-fashioned printed photo frame.\nSamsung 2024 HW-Q990D Phil Nickinson / Digital Trends\nAlong with its new collection of 4K and 8K TVs, Samsung has debuted a few new soundbars at CES 2024, including an update to its critically acclaimed HW-Q990 Dolby Atmos flagship.\nAmong Samsung's many product announcements at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, the Korean electronics giant breathed some new life into its popular Premiere projector lineup. New models are bringing some bold firsts to the projector space, including the Premiere 8K that boasts wireless connectivity and sound that emanates from the screen, and the compact Premiere 5, an ultra short throw (UST) projector that can project onto 3D objects and has touchscreen features.\nSamsung Premiere 8K\nAnd while we're waiting for full details and demos of the projectors from CES 2024, here's what we know right now. Starting with the big guns, Samsung first announced The Premiere 8K UST (ultra short throw) projector last year at CES 2023, but released very few specs outside of it being capable of projecting a monstrous 150-inch image. A year later, it's still not available to purchase. And while full specs, pricing, or release dates still haven't been announced, we've gotten a few more details on the projector.\nSamsung says The Premiere 8K \"achieves several new feats. For starters, it's \"the world's first 8K projector with wireless connectivity,\" by way of Samsung's new Wireless One Connect Box that beams images from up to 10 meters (32.8 feet) away to the actual projector unit. All peripherals (such as steaming devices and DVD players) are connected to the box instead of the projector, making messy wires easier to conceal.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nI saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 products impressed me\nThe innovations happening in the TV space are making content more immersive to consume than ever and the world's leading TV maker led the charge at CES 2024 with meaningful upgrades across its top devices, the launch of new product lines, and two first-in-the-world breakthroughs.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nI got to go eyes-on with everything Samsung unveiled in Las Vegas in its new lineup of TVs, computer monitors, and home entertainment devices and these are the four things I was most excited to share with you.\n1. S95D OLED TV's new \"glare-free\" matte finish\nOne of the simplest 2024 upgrades was also the most impressive to see in person. Samsung's new \"Glare Free OLED\" that it's bringing to the top-of-the-line S95D OLED makes this TV the best one to look at in the entire Samsung lineup. When you combine the beautiful contrast and vibrant color of Samsung's QD-OLED technology with the new matte finish, it produces a TV that is a pleasure to watch from any angle and in the brightest or darkest rooms.\nAlso: Samsung unveils 2024 TVs with AI features that you'd actually want to use\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nInstead of being a giant black mirror like most of today's TVs, the matte finish on the S95D disperses and softens the light from lamps and windows into a minimal glow that's overpowered by the brightness of Samsung's OLED display.\nMy buddy David Katzmaier from CNET did a test where he held up a phone with a completely white screen in front of the new matte S95D and then in front of last year's S95C. Last year's model was like a mirror reflecting back the shape of the phone, while the new glare-free model softened the light into a minimal round glow. ZDNET's Kerry Wan and I did a similar test using the flashlight from Kerry's phone -- with even more intense light -- and got a similarly pleasing result.\nWith the effectiveness of this new matte finish and Samsung's already-great QD OLED technology, I'm confident the S95D will be a top contender for best picture quality in the world among all TVs in 2024.\n2. The Premiere 8K projector\nSamsung announced the world's first 8K wireless ultra short throw projector, and I spent a good deal of time soaking it in at Samsung's First Look event at CES. In the demo area, it was projected onto a 150-inch ambient light rejection (ALR) screen that makes a projector's picture look like a regular TV with its thin black frame around the edge, and is also reminiscent of being at the movies because of the size of the picture and the glare reduction you get from ALR. The result was a very cinema-like experience, and even though projectors can never match the contrast and dynamic range of OLED or QLED, the vibrance of the picture quality was very strong.\nAlso: Xgimi's new IMAX Enhanced projector is an entertainment beast, but wait until you see 'Aladdin'\nFor this new generation of projectors that we're seeing from Samsung and its competitors, 8K makes a lot of sense because they are bringing 100-inch and larger TV displays to a lot more people. And at that size, the extra level of detail and sharpness you get with 8K starts to make a notable difference in picture quality.\nEven at 150 inches, the Premiere 8K projector only had to sit 12 inches from the wall to project an image that large. With its stylish wooden finish, it's also one of the best-designed ultra short throw projectors I've seen. That matters since it's a big rectangular box that often sits awkwardly in your living room. It also comes with a matching One Connect box that you can place somewhere else in the room because it's wireless -- so you don't have to run a bunch of HDMI cables to that awkwardly placed projector box.\n3. Music Frame\nBuilding on the success of The Frame TV -- which turns a TV into a classic work of art or a family photo album when you're not watching something -- Samsung unveiled a new product line at CES 2024: the Music Frame. This product can serve as a hidden speaker to improve the sound of your home cinema experience or offer a much more aesthetically pleasing kitchen speaker than an Amazon Echo or Apple HomePod.\nAlso: Samsung has its own line of video game controllers now. Here's the first model\nThis product masquerades as a standard picture frame and you can slip a photo or a piece of art into it. But it's very thick and has the look of a deep shadowbox, except that the photo or artwork is at the front, and it hides two sound woofers behind it at the back of the frame. You can use two Music Frames to create left and right speakers or a set of rear surround sound speakers that can pair with a Samsung soundbar and TV to create Q-Symphony intelligent surround sound.\nMusic Frame also has a similar frame style and colors to The Frame TV and could match nicely in a room where they were used together.\n4. Transparent Micro-LED display\nSamsung showed off the world's first transparent Micro-LED display and the demo was spectacular -- even if a little gimmicky for something that won't be a viable product for a while. On a slab of glass about an inch thick, the demo unit ran all kinds of flashy content from fireworks going off to vibrant paint splashing out of cans to sports infographics displaying on screen. The colors looked more intense and the display more transparent than competing transparent OLED screens from LG, which have been around for a few years.\nAlso: I saw Samsung and LG's new transparent TVs at CES, and there's a clear winner\nThat makes sense since Micro-LED is the display technology that will likely supersede OLED one day for the highest quality TVs. Samsung has been working for years on Micro-LED, which is best known for its place in The Wall, the absolutely massive and exorbitantly priced TV system that is mostly used in commercial installations like stadiums, car showrooms, large corporate conference rooms, and retail experiences, for example.\nSo why would anyone want a transparent TV or display screen? In the home, it would probably be little more than a virtual fish tank or perhaps a place to show the family calendar, leave messages, and play a slideshow of family photos. Perhaps that will make sense a decade from now when these displays are manufactured at low cost. But today, like The Wall, it will likely be limited to uses like high-end luxury boxes in stadiums where the glass to watch the game can also light up with player information, data points from the game, ads, and notifications. When it gets far cheaper, it could eventually be used to replace glass in public spaces such as bus stops and train stations to show the schedule and live updates.\nRelated\nSamsung's S95D OLED is the best TV of CES 2024 and best in the world right now\nThe best TVs of CES 2024\nThe best TVs you can buy"

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

The company will be participating in the event held in Las Vegas, USA from January 9\u201312, with an exhibition revolving around the theme \u2018All-in Innovative Tech: Paving the New Journey\u2019.\nThe company will\u00a0unveil a new generation of products that can be folded inwards and outwards. Additionally, new monitor-sized OLEDs with both foldable and slidable technologies will be unveiled. It will also showcase a microdisplay with ultra-high resolution for immersive extended reality (XR) experiences that will enhance the way users interact with their devices.\nSamsung Display will showcase its OLED technology across various sizes and form factors. This includes QD-OLEDs designed for monitors with the highest level of pixel density and refresh rates for self-illuminating technology. The company will also present QD-OLEDs specifically developed for televisions, boasting the highest brightness available in the market.\nFlex In&Out\u2122 Flip folds in and out 360 degrees and Rollable Flex\u2122 offers 5x the screen size\nOne of the most eye-catching products at CES 2024 is the Flex In&Out\u2122 Flip, a foldable device with a flip-phone design. Its unique in-and-out foldable technology allows it to fold 360 degrees. Unlike traditional in-folding devices that require an additional panel on the outside for displaying information when folded, Flex In&Out\u2122 Flip achieves a sleeker and thinner design with a single display that can be folded outwards to allow use of the display even when folded.\n\u201cFlex In&Out\u2122 Flip is a technology that can provide a new alternative for consumers who prefer bar-shaped smartphones due to the thickness of foldable products,\u201d said a Samsung Display representative. \u201cWhen folded outwards, both the front and back of the product can be used as a screen, creating a new user experience.\u201d\nSamsung Display\u2019s durability tests showcase its expertise in foldable technology. The panels underwent folding in extreme temperatures ranging from -20 degrees Celsius to 60 degrees Celsius. Additionally, basketballs are bounced on the foldable panels, and the smartphones are subjected to rubbing with sand and immersion in water. These rigorous tests should provide customers with a clear understanding of the durability of Samsung\u2019s foldable products, even in challenging environments.\nSamsung Display will not only be presenting its foldable products at the event but also a range of other innovative offerings. One of these is the Rollable Flex\u2122, a unique device that allows the screen to expand up to five times its original size when unrolled, resembling the action of unrolling a scroll. Another exciting product is the Flex Hybrid, which combines the functionalities of both foldable and slidable technologies. Lastly, Samsung Display will also showcase a wireless earphone case that features a built-in display. These products demonstrate Samsung\u2019s commitment to pushing the boundaries of display technology and delivering innovative solutions to consumers.\nFind the hidden display in the vehicle\nSamsung Display will be showcasing its revolutionary OLED products for vehicle interiors, including the Flex Note Extendable\u2122. This innovative product features a foldable panel that can be unfolded and extended to provide a larger screen size. The Flex Note Extendable\u2122 measures 11 inches when fully folded but can be extended to 13.8 inches with a 10:9 aspect ratio by unfolding one side. By sliding out the other section, the size can be further extended to 17.3 inches with a 4:3 aspect ratio. This flexible design allows for an optimized user experience based on the content being displayed.\nThe screen can serve as a laptop for working in the car or as an extended display for watching movies. When not in use, it can be minimized to save space in the car.\n\u201cCars are now evolving into a mobile space beyond just a means of transportation,\u201d said a Samsung Display representative. \u201cOLED products combined with foldable and slidable technologies will accelerate this transformation.\u201d\nDisplays can be concealed in various areas of the car and easily accessed when needed. An instance of this is a roll-up display, similar in size to a tablet (12.4 inches), discreetly stored within the front passenger headrest. This display can be extended vertically to accommodate different needs, ensuring flexibility and convenience.\nWorld\u2019s first 8.6-generation glass for OLEDs for IT and ultra-thin panels\nHighlighting the shift from LCD to OLED technology in the IT industry, Samsung Display will demonstrate its strength at CES 2024.\nAt CES, Samsung Display will showcase its investment in the 8.6-generation OLED for IT by displaying a nearly 3-meter-high mother glass. This glass, measuring 2290x2620mm, is the largest in the industry and aims to attract visitors\u2019 attention. The 8.6-generation mother glass is more than twice the size of the existing sixth-generation glass, resulting in improved production efficiency. The company will also present special content at CES to give visitors an experience of the size and capabilities of this new technology.\nOne notable feature is the ultra-thin (UT) panel. Samsung Display\u2019s UT OLED panels are about 0.6mm thick, similar to the thickness of a business card, which is one-third the thickness of an LCD panel. This difference is easily noticeable even to the naked eye. Additionally, the UT OLED panels are lightweight, with three UT OLED panels weighing the same as one LCD panel of the same size.\n\u201cBy applying a new module process, we have reduced the thickness while maintaining the same strength,\u201d said a Samsung Display representative. \u201cWe are confident that this will help laptop and tablet manufacturers increase portability and differentiate their designs.\u201d\nMaterial advancements have led to the development of technology that reduces power consumption. Thin-film transistors (TFTs), which regulate current flow, now utilize 100% oxide instead of amorphous silicon (a-Si). This change allows for faster electron movement (about 10 times faster than with a-Si) and reduces current leakage. As a result, flickering, which occurs when a display is driven at a low refresh rate, can be eliminated. Samsung Display\u2019s latest products are the first IT panels to support variable refresh rates as low as 1Hz, enabling significant power savings.\nUnveiling OLEDoS: XR technology delivers industry-leading pixel density and brightness\nSamsung Display is the first to publicly introduce an RGB version of OLEDoS (OLED on Silicon). OLEDoS are high-definition displays with small pixel sizes, achieved by applying organic materials to silicon wafers. These displays will play a crucial role in XR headsets, which are growing in popularity.\nThis will be the highest resolution RGB OLEDoS display when compared to what is available in the industry currently. Despite its small size of 1.03 inches, it boasts a pixel density of 3500 PPI, comparable to a 4K TV. RGB OLEDoS utilizes red, green and blue OLEDs on a silicon wafer to generate colors without the need for a separate light source.\neMagin, the U.S.-based OLEDoS company acquired by Samsung Display, will showcase its products at the event. This includes its OLEDoS-enabled military helmets and night vision goggles.\nQD-OLED to become a \u2018monitor hero\u2018\nSamsung Display will demonstrate its competitive edge in the large-size display sector by introducing the highest quality self-illuminating, ultra-high-definition (UHD) OLED monitor and the world\u2019s first 360Hz OLED monitor.\nThe company is launching a new 31.5-inch UHD (3840x2160) QD-OLED monitor. It has the highest pixel density and UHD resolution among self-illuminating monitors. The pixel density is increased to 140 PPI (Pixel Per Inch), which is equivalent to the picture clarity of a 65-inch 8K TV. The refresh rate can go up to 240Hz.\nSamsung Display is set to introduce a 27-inch panel with a groundbreaking self-illuminating refresh rate of 360Hz, which is the highest amongst mass-produced panels. This high refresh rate, combined with the quick response time of QD-OLED technology, will enhance the immersive experience for activities like gaming and sports that involve rapid screen changes.\nSamsung Display has created an exhibition space to showcase its monitors. The monitors are not only for gaming and entertainment but also for professional use in video production and medical applications. With the slogan \u2018Better Performance! More Professional!\u2019, Samsung Display aims to expand its target market into these professional areas.\n\u201cThis is the year that Samsung Display\u2019s QD-OLEDs prove its unrivaled superiority in picture quality and establish themselves as \u2018monitor heroes,\u2019\u201d said a Samsung Display representative.\nThe TV panel has been upgraded to a brighter third-generation QD-OLED, which will be showcased at CES. This new version utilizes advanced panel drive technology and artificial intelligence (AI) to achieve a maximum brightness of over 3000 nits. This makes it the brightest OLED TV panel available, surpassing previous models. Each RGB color also sees a significant increase in brightness, approximately 50% more compared to last year\u2019s version.\nSamsung Display partnered with Pantone, a well-known color company, to ensure accurate color representation. Pantone is responsible for the Pantone Matching System (PMS), a widely recognized color standard that assigns a unique number to each color. This system allows for consistent color reproduction across different mediums and locations. At CES, attendees can compare the colors on the TV screen with Pantone\u2019s color chips to determine if the QD-OLEDs accurately reproduce colors. Samsung Display\u2019s QD-OLEDs are the first display to receive \u2018Pantone Validated\u2019, highlighting its commitment to delivering true-to-life colors.\n[Press Release] Samsung Display Begins Full-Scale OLED Supply for Premium Gaming Laptop Razer Blade 16\nNo next article.\nHeadquarter: 17113 Samseong-ro 1, Giheung-gu, Yongin-si, Gyeonggi-do, Korea.\nPhone: +82-31-5181-1114\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 SAMSUNG DISPLAY Co.,Ltd.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

Front and center (well, actually, it\u2019s on the left) is an Android touchscreen, with access to the full Google Play store so you can download any of the best music streaming services to listen to in maximum quality via the twin high-end 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DAC, via THX AAA 788+ amplification, meaning this thing can power just about anything you want to connect to it, from hard-to-support headphones to rich speakers. The lid\u2019s E-Ink cover is constructed from many small, but not tiny, segments that can change color to create shapes and designs on the lid with almost no power (we\u2019re talking milliwatts here), but is still bright enough to be seen clearly from far away in a well-lit room, just the kind of thing you\u2019d want your team to be using at a major trade conference with a company logo or other form of marketing graphic on to build hype. Best gaming tech: MSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw is one of the most exciting devices of CES thanks to it being the first gaming handheld to be powered by Intel Core Ultra processors with integrated Intel Arc graphics (with the exciting prospect of hardware-accelerated resolution upscaling via Intel XeSS), but the chip itself is only half the story.\n",

We saw a ton of stuff we thought was seriously great, so be sure to read all our CES news for that \u2013 but these are the products that had the extra juice that got our team talking, and stood out as our Best of CES 2024 winners.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nOur TV of the show simply had to be the first set to make a transparent screen into something practical that you can actually imagine owning. Do we think this will deliver the best picture quality of any TV at CES? No, but that\u2019s not remotely the point. It pushes the art of the TV set to a new level, combining developments from LG\u2019s ground-breaking rollable TV with its unique wireless 4K HDR 120Hz streaming tech and, of course, a clear 4K OLED panel \u2013 all built into a piece of furniture that makes it a real lifestyle object.\nIt can show partially transparent video, or you can watch it like a normal TV with the full contrast you expect from OLED thanks to a contrast-boosting layer that automatically rises out of the base \u2013 plus there's powerful built-in sound, and no cable clutter thanks to the cutting-edge wireless connection box. It all adds up into something unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen before in the best TVs.\nBest projector: Samsung The Premiere 8K\nSamsung\u2019s flagship projector for 2024, The Premiere 8K, is the world\u2019s first to support wireless 8K streaming, something it does using an included One Connect box with Wi-Fi 7 support (picture on the right in the image above). It can beam a 150-inch 8K image when positioned just 12 inches away from a screen, and its brightness is specified at an impressive 4,000 lumens, putting it in good company among the best projectors.\nThe Premiere 8K is also an all-in-one solution for home theater audio and gaming. It has a built-in 8.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system powered by 100 watts, and uses Sound-on-Screen tech to elevate audio from the projector up to the screen area for a more cinematic presentation. Like other Samsung projectors, it features the same smart TV interface found in the company\u2019s TVs for streaming, along with Gaming Hub for cloud-based gaming. It's high-end tech in a very lifestyle-friendly package and design, and we're excited to see more of it.\nBest soundbar: Samsung HW-Q990D\nThe HW-Q990D is the successor to Samsung\u2019s HW-Q990C, which was already the best soundbar for anyone who wants easy but truly powerful and engrossing Dolby Atmos sound. With 22 speaker drivers and 11.1.4 channels, it\u2019s a go-to option for complete Dolby Atmos immersion, and this year Samsung has added 4K 120Hz pass-through to its HDMI ports, fixing the only minor flaw that we found with its predecessor.\nWhen paired with a compatible Samsung TV, the Q990C can receive Dolby Atmos signals wirelessly. It also supports Samsung\u2019s new Active Voice Pro feature, which uses AI to dynamically highlight voices in a movie\u2019s audio mix and elevate them for those movies where you struggle to hear what's going on. Which will be especially welcome when the soundtrack is as powerful and hard-hitting as this soundbar is capable of being, from our time with it on the show floor.\nBest speaker: Brane X\nSometimes at CES, you know the instant you try a product that you\u2019re seeing something that changes your expectations for a type of product. The Brane X is that for the best wireless speakers. It\u2019s a portable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth speaker that has a real, bona fide subwoofer in there. Not a bass port, not a woofer \u2013 a subwoofer that\u2019s the equivalent of an eight-inch sub like you'd find in a soundbar\u2019s separate subwoofer unit. You can see the air vents for it on the right side of the picture above \u2013 it covers the whole bottom of the unit.\nThe difference is absolutely astounding; powerful bass in music that you can feel in your diaphragm for tracks that load up on it, or just a much fuller and richer sound to acoustic instruments that covers a broader, and so more realistic, audio range \u2013 all from something the size of a six-pack. It uses a unique subwoofer design to make this happen, and combined with four other drivers, you get the best, most fulsome sound I\u2019ve heard from any speaker that isn\u2019t a floorstander. It\u2019s launching imminently in the US for $599, and music fans with limited space absolutely must take notice. Not that you\u2019d be able to avoid noticing one if it were playing in front of you.\nBest headphones: Sennheiser Momentum 4 True Wireless\nSennheiser has jumped on the latest generations of Bluetooth tech with its latest wireless earbuds, adding Qualcomm's new chip with Snapdragon Sound for CD-quality audio if you have a compatible phone, but they're also ready for the future of regular Bluetooth with support for Bluetooth 5.4 and LE Audio and Auracast.\nMost importantly, as you'd expect from Sennheiser, we've found they deliver superb audio quality and strong adaptive noise cancellation from what we could tell in our time with them, and still with a long battery life of 7.5 hours in the buds (though we couldn't test that yet). Sennheiser says they're also very low-latency, so will be a step up for gamers.\nWe like the design too, with a shiny finish that nods at jewelry, and a fabric case that follows Sennheiser's other designs. It seems clear that we have a big contender for our list of the best wireless earbuds here.\nBest music player: Fiio R9\nThis all-in-one music system for the streaming world is the ultimate hub however you like to listen, and a great-looking object to have in your home to boot. Front and center (well, actually, it\u2019s on the left) is an Android touchscreen, with access to the full Google Play store so you can download any of the best music streaming services to listen to in maximum quality via the twin high-end 8-Channel ESS Sabre ES9038PRO DAC, via THX AAA 788+ amplification, meaning this thing can power just about anything you want to connect to it, from hard-to-support headphones to rich speakers. But in a nice touch, if you don\u2019t want to sign up to Google, Fiio has added its own app store with major music services on board, no login required.\nThe box can handle basically any kind of digital file you could want to throw at it, from PCM 768kHz/32-Bit to DSD512 to MQA, and it even has two kinds of HDMI connection (ARC and straight audio, for SACD/DVD-Audio fans) and it sounds absolutely fantastic. We listened with Fiio\u2019s new FT5 planar magnetic headphones, and there\u2019s so much power and poise and dynamic range, all in a sleek metal design with light-up dials. For those who want the feeling of a huge music system and library in a compact space, this is irresistible.\nBest laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook 13x Gen 4 SPE\nLenovo has been experimenting with E-Ink laptop covers for a few years now, and the Lenovo ThinkBook 13x Gen 4 SPE concept laptop seems like the natural evolution of its work to date. Even more though, it feels like we can finally see the point of having an E-Ink cover at all.\nThe E-Ink Prism technology built into the lid of the laptop enables you to create a color design on your laptop lid that isn\u2019t just a picture, but can feature animation that brings unparalleled personalization to your device in a way a simple sticker or case on the best laptops never could.\nIt\u2019s not as simple as uploading a PNG, however. The lid\u2019s E-Ink cover is constructed from many small, but not tiny, segments that can change color to create shapes and designs on the lid with almost no power (we\u2019re talking milliwatts here), but is still bright enough to be seen clearly from far away in a well-lit room, just the kind of thing you\u2019d want your team to be using at a major trade conference with a company logo or other form of marketing graphic on to build hype. For the rest of us, we can still absolutely make the device our own \u2013 Lenovo's breathed new life into laptop design with this version of the tech.\nBest computing component: AMD Ryzen 8040 Series\nThe Ryzen 8040-series CPUs that AMD announced at CES 2024 are more than just Team Red\u2019s answer to Intel\u2019s Meteor Lake mobile processors, if AMD\u2019s published benchmarks are right, it might be the AI chip to have in the best laptops next year, such as the new Razer Blade 14 pictured above, which includes the new platform.\nAccording to AMD, the new Ryzen 8040 series processors aren\u2019t just competitive with Intel\u2019s newest mobile silicon, they outpace them across a wide array of workloads from gaming to the latest generative AI tools such as Stable Diffusion.\nOf course, AMD is going to cherry pick its best results if it can, but if its numbers are accurate, these mobile processors can go a long way to eating into Intel\u2019s absolutely dominant position in the mobile laptop market, and give people a real reason to switch over from Team Blue.\nBest gaming tech: MSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw is one of the most exciting devices of CES thanks to it being the first gaming handheld to be powered by Intel Core Ultra processors with integrated Intel Arc graphics (with the exciting prospect of hardware-accelerated resolution upscaling via Intel XeSS), but the chip itself is only half the story.\nMSI has a long pedigree for gaming hardware, and its new device is a stunning handheld in its own right. The 1080p display is incredibly crisp thanks to its wide color coverage and speedy refresh rate, while the 16GB LPDDR5 RAM and up to 1TB NVMe SSD storage will help make managing your game library on the go a lot less painful. We were impressed with the whole device in our MSI Claw hands-on, and we can't wait to get deeper into using it.\nBest computing accessory: Razer Project Esther\nRazer Project Esther is the iconic peripherals brand\u2019s latest take on a fairly old and often repetitive gaming technology that has always offered the promise of deeper immersion, but never really truly gotten there. While there are seams in the Project Esther\u2019s Sensa HD Haptic technology, they are extremely tight, and the overall experience this chair cushion provides is difficult-to-describe (though I certainly tried in a hands-on preview of Project Esther earlier this week).\nThe long and short of what makes this cushion so different is that while many haptic products promise more immersive gaming, Project Esther comes way closer to what most people are hoping for than any competing product on the market thanks to its directional HD haptics. The closest analogue to this would be Dolby Atmos, but for haptics \u2013 and with a software development kit for game developers to fine-tune the haptic experience of their games, this device is one of the few products of this kind that gamers are really going to want if it goes on-sale.\nBest mobile accessory: Clicks Keyboard\nThe question isn't whether you need Clicks, the premium new keyboard that attaches to the iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro. The question is why aren't there more keyboards for smartphones already? If you write a lot of messages, or even if you just write captions for your favorite photos and videos, Clicks gives you a smart new way to type that frees up a ton of screen space.\nIt's pricey at $139, but it feels like a premium keyboard for your Pro-level iPhone. It's got a backlight, and it comes in a staid London Blue or smiley-faced Bumblebee yellow that will attract glances from curious keyboard newbs and old school BlackBerry fans alike. We've never done more writing on our phones, and Clicks strongly makes the case that physical keys are due a comeback.\nBest smart home innovation: Nanoleaf Orchestrator\nNanoleaf's Orchestrator software is a massive improvement upon the smart lighting company's existing Rhythm tool, taking music visualization to new heights. Not only does it interpret the beat and melodies into color palettes and motions (and allow for personalization, too), but you can even group your devices into different parts of the tracks, too.\nWhere Rhythm uses on-device built-in microphones to detect sound, Orchestrator picks apart music played through your laptop or PC, identifying the mood and layers of a track to create a gorgeous complimentary light show. The only software we've tried that comes close is Philips Hue's, but that's exclusive to Spotify and way less customizable.\nAs of writing, it's only available on the Nanoleaf Desktop App, but we'd be very surprised if a mobile equivalent didn't roll out within the next year or two. The fun this can add to your smart lighting setup can't be underestimated\nBest small appliance: Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo\nWhile the robot vacuum and mop part of this product itself isn't brand new at CES, having released late last year, this new edition of the Deebot X2 is pretty special and novel; it features a connected handheld vacuum (or one with a handle), which also auto-empties itself into the same vacuum bag as the robot vacuum when you dock it. The space-saving potential is excellent, but more than that, the vacuum is pretty accomplished, too.\nThe Deebot X2 robot vacuum is square-shaped, optimized for better wall-to-wall and corner cleaning, and sporting a gorgeous, minimalist design. Plus, thanks to the Matter 1.2 rollout, the bot is now Matter-compatible, though it also supports Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri Shortcuts natively, as well as its own Yiko 2.0 voice control.\nIt's just a great pairing that brings a feature that's been a recent and extremely convenient feature of the best robot vacuums (the self-emptying tool) to the world of the best cordless vacuums. When you've finished, you just pop it back to charge and you don't need to think about the dust. We love it.\nBest wellness tech: Baracoda BMind\nThe BMind smart mirror is a glimpse into the bathrooms of the future. Powered by generative AI and Natural Language Processing, it offers personalized recommendations based on the user's mental state, all controlled by a combination of gesture and voice commands. It can do things like detect that you look sad, and ask you how your day is going, and make changes based on your response.\nFor example, you can say that you're feeling sad or down, and it will use light therapy techniques, changing its LED light output in a way that can help to improve your mood. It also has mindfulness exercises such as guided meditation built in that it can suggest and run too \u2013 all provided through the CareOS interface and programs from ThrivePal. Its built-in camera has face detection so everything is personalized for you (and kept only to you).\nIt can also help in more physical ways, with guided toothbrushing coaching, and skin analysis, so it can make recommendations for how to, say, reduce redness in your face. If it works as well as BMind says, it could be a much more convenient way to get help and advice than by reaching for your phone and it'll be more personalized.\nBest wearable: Evie Smart Ring\nNot only is Evie a rare gem among health devices at CES, in that it will actually launch, but it's also a wearable device that puts women first in all the best ways.\nFrom its gorgeous, open design that accommodates the natural fluctuations in a woman's body over the course of the month, to its intelligent application and AI insights engine, Evie's all about putting women's health center-stage in an industry where it's often an afterthought.\nBest of all, it's completely subscription free, meaning you can enjoy its medical-grade sleep, blood oxygen, heart health detection and menstrual data insights without worrying about the on-going cost. This looks like a great rival to the best smart rings.\nBest health tech: Withings BeamO\nThe idea of a do-it-all, handheld medical diagnostic devices is not new; fans of Star Trek well remember Dr. McCoy\u2019s Tricorder. Withings' BeamO is not quite that, but may be an exciting baby step in the right direction. It\u2019s a lightweight, compact, all-in-one device that can run ECG, blood oxygen, temperature and even stethoscope tests.\nYou don\u2019t wave BeamO in front of a body to detect trouble. Instead, you\u2019ll place BeamO against your temple or chest (or hold the sensors on it for SPO2 and ECG readings). The exciting thing is that whatever data it collects can instantly be shared with your healthcare professional who will know how to read your health stats.\nBest outdoor tech: Swarovski Ax Visio\nHigh-end binoculars with a digital camera built-in so that you can capture what you're looking at are nothing new. High-end binoculars with a digital camera and AI recognition software that can tell you what you're looking at? That's new, and extremely cool. The neural processing unit in these binoculars is similar to what you get in the latest phones, and has been trained to identify 9,000 species of birds, so you no longer need to refer to a book or call your twitching uncle to discover what was hanging out on that cliff.\nSimply take a look through them like any other binoculars to find something interesting, and when you see a mystery bird, press a button on the side that will show a red circle in your vision. Get your bird into this circle, and its name will appear underneath. It's the ideal use of this kind of technology, and a perfectly futuristic upgrade to the most old-school of products.\nBest yard tech: Weber Summit Grill\nWeber makes some of the most effective grills and smokers you can buy, and now the company is offering one of the most advanced with the Weber Summit Smart Grill. This is for aspiring or accomplished chefs, as the featureset could cater a serious party. Besides the six burners, the infrared element up top, and the rotisserie spit, you get a digital PID controller that truly represents the next generation of grilling. It monitors everything, from the flame activity to the temperature to the gas levels, and gives you helpful feedback where to place your food for the best direct and indirect heat cooking.\nThe Weber Summit grill includes remarkable safety features that check the fire constantly, and even though it looks like a fancy computer, it can handle the same extreme heat and cold weather that you'd expect from any Weber grill, so it's not more delicate just because it's smarter. This will turn anyone in a true grilling pro.\nBest science tech: Celestron Origin\nAmateur astronomers dream of powerful telescopes and long warm nights of star gazing. The reality is the best time for star gazing is in the winter, and most telescopes are exercises in frustration. Smart telescopes bridge the gap between our stargazing wishes and the ability to carry them out, and Celestron Origin takes the concept to the next level.\nIt does all the hard work of finding celestial bodies, and will let you schedule when you want it to find and capture imagery of the planets, stars, and galaxies. Better yet, you can do it all from the warmth and comfort of your living room couch, using an iPad or your Phone. Want to see what it captured? It\u2019ll show up on your screen and you can cast it to your living room TV. This is the kind of armchair astronomy we can get behind.\nBest car tech: BMW Augmented Reality Ride Concept\nYou wouldn\u2019t think augmented reality and driving would go perfect together, and yet BMW showed me how wearing Xreal Air 2 glasses inside a beautiful EV BMW would somehow feel natural and even useful. The concept is simple: Xreal\u2019s glasses integrate with your phone, which is connected to the car to deliver real-time AR imagery that can tell you things about your trip that you might otherwise miss or have to glance down at a screen to see. Think direction, hazards, and indications that you\u2019re veering into the other lane, and you get the idea. The concept even extends to your passengers, who could, with their own glasses, turn any car surface into a screen for bingeing on the road.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.
