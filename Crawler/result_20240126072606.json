        "raw_content": "Switzerland-Based Solar Startup Perovskia Is Bringing Solar Indoors With Its Printed Perovskite Cells\nPerovskia is a Switzerland-based startup that has developed a perovskite-based solar cell technology that can be printed directly onto glass. They\u2019re currently utilizing this technology to enable solar cells to be added to indoor devices. They\u2019re targeting indoor devices as perovskite solar cells have a linear production curve that doesn\u2019t degrade as much as silicon solar cells do when indoors.\nCleanTechnica connected with their team at CES 2024 and took a deep dive into their approach to solar and the path to global markets.\nTheir unique process allows them to build solar cells in just about any two dimensional shape. They are also extremely thin, allowing solar to go where no solar has gone before.\u00a0After the cells are printed onto the glass substrate, they can then be wired into the device to provide power.\nThey\u2019re also working on a technology that will allow them to directly print their perovskite solar cells onto printed circuit boards or PCBs. If successful, this technology would open up a wide range of new applications both in terms of the direct integration with printed circuits and an entirely new level of low profile solar cells.\nEven with their current printing technology, Perovskia is exploring the use of ultra thin glass they can print directly onto. This rather linear extrapolation of currently technologies opens up even more possibilities with this next generation solar cell technology. As a technology being built by a startup, Perovskia\u2019s solar cells are already competitive with silicon-based cells, though obviously they do still come at a premium due to the lower production volumes that come with bespoke projects, custom solutions, and startup volumes.\nEven as a startup, Perovskia already has numerous customers all around the world. They are working on products for customers in the US, Israel, and beyond. Most of the cells they brought to CES were rather standard square cells but they also brought numerous novel shapes including rounded solar cells, narrow rectangular cells, and even a solar cell shaped like a double helix to demonstrate the technology\u2019s ability to adapt and be printed in just about any shape imaginable.\nFor more information, head over to their website and check out the video below of an interview with founder Anand Verma.\nShare this story!\nI'm a tech geek passionately in search of actionable ways to reduce the negative impact my life has on the planet, save money and reduce stress.

        "raw_content": "Swiss perovskite startup sets up indoor solar cell manufacturing\nIndoor solar cell developer, Perovskia Solar, is setting up a factory in Switzerland that may reportedly print 1 million of its custom-designed perovskite devices annually. It targets the market for self-powering consumer electronics and internet-of-things devices, such as fire-alarms, fitness trackers, and sensors.\nImage: Perovskia Solar\nPerovskia Solar, a Swiss developer of indoor solar cells, is setting up a factory in Aubonne, Switzerland to produce one million printed perovskite devices annually.\n\u201cIt is a sheet-to-sheet production line based on commercially available equipment with minor customization. It includes a new in-house built tool to simply print the encapsulation material,\u201d Anand Verma, Perovskia Solar's CEO, told pv magazine. \u201cThe full cell stack with contacts is printed in-house on glass substrates.\u201d\nPerovskia is a spinoff of the Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (EMPA). It was founded to develop the market for customized perovskite solar devices as battery replacements. A recent design-in win was a bracelet-style health tracker developed by France-based Baracoda, which won an innovation award last year at the 2023 CES Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIn 2023, Perovskia had 15 original equipment manufacturers (OEM) in the process of evaluating, testing or producing products. \u201cTwo out of 15 were already using another indoor PV technology, either amorphous silicon or organic PV. The rest were using conventional batteries. That confirms to us that the application is clearly battery replacement,\u201d said Verma.\nPopular content\nOptimized for indoor light condition, Perovskia Solar's latest generation of cells have an open-circuit voltage of 0.9 V and a power output of 80 \u00b5w/cm\u00b2 \u2013 85 \u00b5w/cm\u00b2 under indoor lighting at 1,000 lux. \u201cWe are aiming to increase it to 100 \u00b5w/cm\u00b2 \u2013 120 \u00b5w/cm\u00b2 in a development project with EMPA,\u201d said Verma.\npv magazine print edition\nThe seasonal, December and January edition of pv magazine reveals the much-anticipated winners of this year\u2019s pv magazine Awards. We also consider the ramifications of the current global oversupply of solar panels, Australia\u2019s prospects of refining battery raw materials, and examine how the European Union\u2019s green hydrogen ambitions are developing.\nAs for stability, Verma noted efficiency of 80% is maintained after 5,000 hours of full sun exposure. The devices also reportedly retains 90% of its original efficiency after 1000 hours. \u201cIndeed, we have passed accelerated benchmarks. The typical perovskite degradation rates are avoided by using additives,\u201d said Verma, adding that the devices comply with Restriction of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (RoHS) standards.\nPerovskia Solar\nThis content is protected by copyright and may not be reused.

        "raw_content": "Solar Tents and Windows, Battery on Wheels: Energy Tech From CES 2024\nHere's the best home energy technology we saw this year, from giant batteries to stained glass solar panels to machines that harvest water from thin air.\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nThe world convened at CES 2024\u00a0this past week to get its first look at the tech that could be coming to your home in the near future. Most, if not all, of the tech on display -- from the best of show to the wacky\u00a0to the cutting edge -- had one thing in common: electricity.\nWhile electricity keeps all your tech running, it's also more of a focus itself this year. There were more than enough solar-powered gadgets, portable power stations and visions for the future of energy to go around. If 2024 is the year you take control of your home's electricity, here's the tech we saw at CES that might help you do it.\nA whole home backup battery you can take with you\nEcoFlow had the Delta Pro Ultra loaded up on a cart at CES so you could wheel it around. It's surprisingly easy to move a battery that weighs nearly 200 pounds.\nThe variety of backup batteries has exploded over the last few years. Other companies have introduced their competitors to Tesla's well-known Powerwall battery, while the field of smaller, portable power stations is even more crowded. EcoFlow, a company that makes some of CNET's favorite portable power stations, introduced a new battery model that aims for the middle ground between portable and whole home backup.\nCan solar panels save you money?\nInterested in understanding the impact solar can have on your home? Enter some basic information below, and we\u2019ll instantly provide a free estimate of your energy savings.\nWhen paired with its Smart Home Panel Pro 2, EcoFlow's Delta Pro Ultra power station can provide power to your home or be unplugged and wheeled away for energy on the go. EcoFlow touts an easier setup; you only need to have the smart panel professionally installed. Unlike most home backups, which are permanent, you can take the EcoFlow with you if you move. That can save you on installation costs and keep you from having to buy a new battery at your new place. It's another step toward more reliable and flexible energy use at home.\nA solar-powered rooftop tent\nJackery's rooftop tent solar panels are a dramatic-looking way to power a camping adventure.\nJackery, a company with plenty of portable power solutions, is looking to launch its most inventive product later this year. That's when you might be able to get your hands on\u00a0a popup tent with built-in solar panels that can be mounted to the top of a vehicle. Final specs and design are being hashed out, but a company spokesperson said the solar tent is likely to cost about $6,000 when it's available for purchase.\nJackery also had a solar-powered Mars rover on display (that it has no plans of sending to Mars) and an itty-bitty power station with a capacity of just under 100 watt-hours. That means Jackery's Explorer 100 just squeezes under the battery capacity limit for items you can take on a plane, the company told CNET. As a slightly nervous flier, I expect you might draw some extra attention at security.\nControl your home's power with the push of a button\nSavant's smart energy system allows you to switch your home from on-grid to off-grid with a tap.\nSavant\u00a0is one of several companies that gives you\u00a0insight into and control over how your home uses energy. Through sensors and controllers installed in your breaker box, Savant's system lets you see where power is flowing, from your solar panels, your battery or the grid. With\u00a0newly introduced features, controlling that flow is easier than ever.\nModes and scenes are customizable configurations of what's turned on or off in your house. Modes like \"eco mode\" prioritize using power from your solar panels, while \"storm watch\" ensures your battery is topped up in case of an outage. Scenes can be set to turn off all but necessary circuits when you're away from work or to power certain circuits during one season or another. Changing all that with the push of a button makes saving energy all that much more convenient.\nA power station with swappable batteries\nThe battery packs in the Bluetti AC180T portable power station are hot-swappable, so you can just take one of these things out of the station while it's operating.\nBluetti has made some of CNET's favorite portable energy products, like power stations and solar panels, since we've been testing them over the last few years. The company is at CES this year demonstrating a few concept products it's hoping to sell in the future.\nOne is a portable power station with a twist. Rather than one battery stuck inside the walls of the power station, the AC180T has battery packs you can swap in and out, while the power station is running your devices. This could make for even more flexible charging on the go. CNET's Jon Reed said swapping the batteries was \"weirdly fun to do.\" The AC180T has an energy storage capacity of 1,433 watt-hours (or about 1.4 kilowatt-hours.) Bluetti is planning to crowdfund the device's development with an Indiegogo campaign in February.\nIndoor solar cells with a ton of applications\nThis mechanical keyboard isn't powered by batteries or with a cord but via the solar cells on the right side of it.\nSolar cells that work indoors are not new. You might have used a calculator that powered up under your middle school's fluorescent lights.\u00a0Ambient Photonics' updated version delivers about three times the energy of those older models. This means they might be able to power things with a slightly higher appetite for energy: computer mice, TV remotes or anything else that might take AA or AAA batteries.\nPortable fridges gain new features and efficiency\nGoal Zero's Alta 50 portable refrigerator can supposedly run on just 8 watts of power once it's holding at temperature. That can last a long time on even a small power station.\nBluetti's swappable battery tech will be useful in other Bluetti devices, like the MultiCooler portable fridge. The fridge can keep things cool or downright frigid, from 68 to -4 degrees Fahrenheit. What's more, it has a built-in ice maker. Whether that's strictly necessary for a portable fridge is probably up for debate, but you can imagine the device making for some truly luxurious camping.\nOther portable fridges from another portable power stalwart were debuted by Goal Zero. The Alta fridges come in 50- and 80-liter capacities. The smaller version can maintain temperature using just 8 watts of power, once it's reached the targeted temp. That means that Goal Zero's smallest power station can run the fridge for over a day. Goal Zero introduced three new portable power stations and a home battery backup, joining the trend of other energy storage companies that started small, but are now offering larger, whole-home backup solutions at a more affordable price.\nStained glass that generates electricity\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nCES is great for finding odd, but cool little gadgets and the solar sector is no exception. Japanese solar company inQs is promoting its transparent solar technology with a range of solar-powered, see-through gadgets, including a silicon quartz crystal (pictured above) that can generate photovoltaic electricity. A company representative told CNET's Jon Reed its technology could also be deployed in windows, transparent or stained.\nBecause transparent solar tech is still emerging and not yet widely deployed, the challenge of recycling them doesn't loom as large as it does from the more traditional opaque, black or blue panels you see on roofs. Still, inQs says its tech, built on silicon quartz, is easier and safer to recycle and includes no rare earth materials.\nElectronics company Panasonic was also talking up see-through solar tech this year, namely perovskites. Perovskite solar technology is still largely in research and development (and not just by Panasonic) but could open up a wide variety of solar applications, like solar on windows and the side of buildings. Or, you can stick solar on solar: In labs, perovskite solar layered on top of silicon solar panels achieves much higher efficiency ratings than either technology can separately.\nA battery that can take a beating\nXing Mobility tested its battery cooling technology by driving three needles into the side of a battery pack. You can see where those cells blew up, but the rest of the pack looks alright.\nBatteries are a key element in the electrification of everything and the transformation of the power grid. Increasing their durability and safety, especially in settings like electric vehicles, could be an important way of stretching the resources needed to make them. CNET's Jon Reed saw battery cells from Xing Mobility that, when intentionally damaged, caught fire but quickly extinguished. That's thanks to a nonconductive, petroleum-based lubricant that extinguished the fire and cooled the battery off quickly. Most of the battery actually kept its charge. Batteries with this ability could be useful in cars and tractors and trucks, where they're more likely to get a little roughed up.\nA heat pump that can keep pace in the cold\nBosch says its new IDS Ultra cold-climate heat pump can meet a home's heating needs when the outside temperature drops as low as 5 degrees Fahrenheit.\nHeating and cooling a home is often its biggest energy-related expense. Heat pumps are the electric heating and cooling solution of the future as they are efficient and can be powered by clean energy sources. One ding against them is their performance in cold climates, although as the technology improves, heat pumps are performing better and better below zero.\nBosch's new heat pump, the IDS Ultra, is the company's first heat pump designed for cold-weather performance. Unveiled on the CES floor this year, the IDS Ultra can keep your house warm down to 5 degrees Fahrenheit (-15 degrees Celsius) and keep working down to -13 F (-25 C). The Bosch model joins others from companies like Daikin, Midea, Johnson Controls, Lennox International, Carrier, Trane and Rheem that have passed the first stage of the Department of Energy's Residential Cold Climate Heat Pump Challenge.\nMoisture farming in the 21st century\nThe Genesis Systems WaterCube is a big steel box that pulls water from the air.\nIt sounds like tech from a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, but you might soon be able to pull water right from the air. The WC-100 WaterCube from Genesis Systems is an 800-pound machine that can harvest 100 gallons of water per day at 80 degrees Fahrenheit and 50% humidity, although the company says it can work all the way down to below 10% humidity. It should get about 200 pounds lighter before it reaches the market, the company says.\nThe WC-100 WaterCube could be useful if your water supply is disrupted or to offset your water bill. You'd have to shave a lot of that water bill to recoup the cost, which sits at a hefty $20,000.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nSolar Installer Guides\nBest Solar Products and Companies\nSolar Installers by State\nSolar Installers & Storage\nSolar Resources and Guides\nOther Energy Saving Guides\nOther Types of Energy\nLiving Off the Grid Series\nUpdated Jan. 15, 2024\n6:00 a.m. PT\nWe thoroughly evaluate each company and product we review and ensure our stories meet our high editorial standards.

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Their technology, called SQPV glass, won the show\u2019s Best of Innovation award. Credit: TBW Advisors LLC, YouTube\nThe year 2022 was an inflection point for solar energy, with rooftop installations growing rapidly in both the commercial and residential sectors. However, current solar panel design limits the options for integrating this technology into buildings.\nNew materials and design formats for solar cells would provide more opportunities to integrate this technology into the home. Several examples of novel solar solutions were on display at CES 2024.\nCES, formerly the Consumer Electronics Show, is said to be the world\u2019s largest annual consumer technology trade show. It takes place each January at the Las Vegas Convention Center in Winchester, Nevada.\nThis year, CES took place January 9\u201312 and welcomed more than 135,000 attendees and more than 4,300 exhibitors. During the four-day event, several key announcements were made regarding home solar devices. View the highlights below.\nTransparent solar technology wins \u2018Best of Innovation\u2019\nSilicon solar panels traditionally come in two main formats: polycrystalline (blue) cells, which are less efficient but more affordable; or monocrystalline (black) cells, which are more efficient but less affordable. These cells capture energy mostly from the visible light spectrum (400\u2013700 nm).\nIn contrast to these opaque cells, transparent solar technologies made from various materials capture energy mostly from the ultraviolet (100\u2013400 nm) and infrared (760+ nm) wavelengths. This absorption spectrum makes transparent solar cells much less efficient than traditional ones. But their transparency opens new opportunities for integrating solar cells into the built environment, for example, as windows, screens, and even smartphone displays.\nAt CES 2024, the Best of Innovation award went to a transparent solar technology called SQPV glass, which is currently only available in Japan. This technology is based on initial research and patents from Japanese company International Frontier Technology Laboratory Inc., and the company\u2019s subsidiary inQs Co. Ltd. developed it into a commercial product.\nThe SQPV glass consists of strategically arranged nanomaterials sandwiched between two conductive glass sheets. Light is captured from both glass surfaces while maintaining a visible light transmittance of 75%.\ninQs showcased the possibilities for integrating SQPV glass within the home via a stained-glass solar window display at CES 2024. In a CNET article on the invention, inQs chief international officer Rike Wootten notes that the glass is made of \u201cvery, very easy to find materials\u201d and can be \u201ceasily and safely disposed of,\u201d in contrast to conventional solar panels.\nPanasonic demonstrates printing of semitransparent perovskite cells\nIn addition to inQs, Japan-based Panasonic Group also showcased (semi)transparent solar technology at CES 2024 in the form of inkjet-printed perovskite coatings.\nAs explained in a CNET article, Panasonic\u2019s goal is to directly deposit the perovskite coatings onto windows, walls, and facades, thus turning these surfaces into solar-energy generators. Panasonic can vary the coating\u2019s transparency depending on a customer\u2019s preference for efficiency or see-through ability.\nPanasonic is still in the research and development phase of this technology and expects several more years until deployment. However, the company reports that its coatings can already achieve 18.1% conversion efficiency. (NOTE: The video below came out two years ago and thus reports a lower efficiency.)\nAmbient Photonics showcases wide array of solar-integrated household products\nSolar-powered calculators, originally introduced in the late 1970s, are a prime example of how solar cells can be used to power small household devices. At CES 2024, California-based Ambient Photonics demonstrated the potential to replace batteries with solar in a much wider array of devices.\nAs described in a CNET article, the Ambient Photonics booth contained keyboards, computer mice, smart home sensors, and other devices featuring its newly improved solar cells. These cells, which are specifically designed for low-light environments, deliver about three times the energy than the cells found in old calculators.\nAmbient Photonics\u2019 solar cells come in several sizes, ranging from slightly larger than a thumbnail to about the size of a dollar bill. The cells are not yet available for purchase, but they could be later this year thanks to partnerships with Primax, to develop an ambient solar mouse, and Google, to create a \u201cnew consumer product.\u201d\nDon\u2019t miss the latest ceramic and glass materials news.

Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
