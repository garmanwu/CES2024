        "raw_content": "The curtain has fallen on CES, the world\u2019s largest consumer technology expo, and there are two highlights worth our attention\nIn recent days, the four-day \u2018Consumer Electronics Spring Festival\u2019\u2014the 2024 International Consumer Electronics Show (CES)\u2014concluded in Las Vegas, USA. It is reported that this year, the number of Chinese exhibitors and attendees reached a small peak in recent years. According to data released by CES, among the over 4,000 exhibiting companies, more than 1,100 are Chinese enterprises and their overseas branches. With AI integrating into PCs and home appliances, cars growing wings, and robots and XR entering broader scenes such as healthcare and disaster relief, the lively CES \u2018tech temple fair\u2019 seems to herald the gradual recovery of the consumer electronics industry in the coming days. Meanwhile, LED screen technology remains an indispensable focus at CES.\u201d\nThe Emerging Trend of New Display Technologies at the ExhibitionThe transparent display is undoubtedly a major attraction at the exhibition. MUXWAVE\u2019s holographic invisible screen has introduced a rapid free splicing and ultra-light ultra-thin suspension solution, utilizing P3.91 pixel pitch with no glass encapsulation, presenting a sleek and atmospheric appearance. The screen is as thin as 1.8mm and weighs only 6kg/m\u00b2. The technology of transparent display once again leaves people amazed. LED transparent screens have rapidly developed and become a new force in the commercial display field, representing an irreplaceable presence in the LED display segment. In the last two years, the LED transparent screen industry has undergone significant changes, transitioning from incremental to stock competition. The industry market is rapidly expanding, with an increase in demand, and manufacturers are competing in terms of growth rate. However, as the market reaches a saturation point, growth slows down or even stalls. In this limited market demand, competition shifts towards market share.\nXR Virtual Display Demonstrates Impressive CapabilityAccording to incomplete statistics, this exhibition has seen the participation of over 350 XR companies from around the world, including terminal manufacturers and upstream optical solution providers. In fact, concerning the XR industry, the release of the Apple Vision Pro last year rekindled interest in this sector, redirecting market attention here. According to the latest Counterpoint Global XR (VR/AR) Forecast, the shipment volume of Extended Reality (XR) headsets is expected to increase by 3.9 million units in 2024, reaching a historic high and achieving double-digit YoY growth. Augmented Reality (AR) is projected to grow by 54% YoY in 2024, reversing the downward trend of the past three years.\nMoreover, the imaginative space for combining XR virtual technology with various industries is vast, bringing more creativity and possibilities to display technology. XR technology enables intelligent adaptive displays, more accurate color matching, and, with the help of AI algorithms or large model technology, LED displays achieve more intelligent content display, advertising delivery, command decisions, and more. Integrated with smart home and smart office scenarios, enhancing the efficiency of LED displays may bring about more comfortable visual effects or higher work efficiency in the future.\u201d\nWatsApp\uff1a\nE-mail\uff1a\nMarketing Center\uff1a4th Floor East, Building 4, Shenzhen Software Park, No.2 Gaoxinzhong 2nd Road, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, P.R.China\nProduction Base\uff1aRoom 401,Building G,Guancheng Low Carbon Industrial Park,Shangcun Community,\nGongming Street, Guangming District, Shenzhen,Guangdong,China\n\u00a9 2024 Shenzhen MUXWAVE\u00a0 Technology Co., Ltd.\nAll Rights Reserved \u7ca4ICP\u59072022137224\u53f7\nLinksLED display | LED holographic screen\nUsername or email\u00a0*\nPassword\u00a0*\nRemember me\nLogin\nLost your password?"

        "raw_content": "Inside-Out Phones, Folding TVs: Behold The Eye-Popping Tech of CES 2024\nThe world's largest consumer tech show is a showcase of incredible innovation, and this is the cream of the crop.\nWe got an eyeful of a 137-inch TV that folds and unfolds, here at CES 2024.\nCES 2024\u00a0is full of innovative delights,\u00a0futuristic concepts, practical products you can\u00a0preorder or buy today\u00a0and some of the\u00a0strangest tech to stumble across our paths. Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives.\nAs we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of\u00a0ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies,\u00a0new car tech, gaming gear and robots\u00a0-- there's even a robot for your dog.\nHere's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.\nRead more: \u00a0The Best of Show at CES 2024.\nAR/VR glasses that fit in one room\nApple may have stolen the show in absentia announcing that the Vision Pro would be available next month, but the headset is still insanely expensive at $3,500. While it's yet to be seen whether\u00a0AR/VR technology will take off, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, including the intriguing-looking Xreal Air 2 Ultra ($699). The Xreal is a lot more compact than the Apple behemoth, the price is relatively competitive and CNET's Lisa Eadiciccio was impressed by its image quality. However, she says the headset still needs to be tethered to another device, and it'll need third-party developers if it's to have a chance against Apple or even Google.\nA portable, add-on OLED display that folds\nSecondary displays are a productivity godsend, enabling the kind of multitasking that isn't possible even with the widest monitors. While portable solutions are available, the best solutions tend to be tethered to your desk. Maker Asus says the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH is the first portable OLED display -- and as the name suggests, it also folds! With the superior image quality of OLED, this 17.3-incher should be great for on-the-go movies or gaming, when it hits later in 2024.\nHitch a ride on a flying EV taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the debut of the Supernal S-A2.\nBanish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design\u00a0and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter. As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.\nThe future is electric\nHonda promises that the Saloon will match \"the joy of driving\" with steer-by-wire technology.\nAs we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle that could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the \"board room on wheels\" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs!\nThe most impressive, and most-likely concept to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing \"steer-by-wire\" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new \"floating H\" logo.\nFoldable phones? How about a foldable TV?\nThe C Seed N1, unfolded.\nWhat to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch C Seed N1 showed off at CES 2024.\nThe custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture,\nand its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk\nin about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV.\nOh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nSteam Deck has a new challenger\nMSI's new game handheld runs Windows but has Intel inside.\nAfter years of near misses such as the Steam Machine, the Steam Deck was an unexpected success for Valve, and the console is the current standard for mobile PC gaming. While the competing\u00a0Asus ROG Ally looked cool, using Windows on it was apparently pretty clunky. Now that situation might change with the help of Intel -- the company has a lot of experience making Windows machines. MSI's Claw handheld obviously owes a debt to the Steam Deck, but it has Intel's new Meteor Lake chips onboard instead of AMD chips. CNET's Scott Stein says this development means more manufacturers will have the opportunity to design their own Steam Deck-alikes that can also run Windows.\nWhat's old is new\nIf\nyou consider yourself an old-school smartphone user, you may yearn for\nthe physical keyboards that used to be a mainstay of the phones of\nyesteryear. The iPhone's on-screen keyboard ushered out the full\nphysical keyboards that were popular on\u00a0BlackBerry\u00a0devices.\nThe Clicks keyboard,\nfrom Clicks Technology, will transform your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15\nPro and Pro Max, adding a keyboard that's actually integrated into a\nwraparound case. This $139 wraparound slides onto your device and runs\noff the phone's battery, so no charging required. Be sure to check out our hands-on review.\nThis phone bends over backward for you\nAs phones with screens that fold in half get more consumer attention, Samsung appears to be poised to flip the market again. The electronics giant showcased a concept handset at\u00a0CES 2024 called the Flex In & Out Flip that can fold in both directions and completely backward, allowing you to use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nWhen bent backward, one side is slightly shorter than the other, to avoid covering the camera, while the larger side was big enough to show several icons in the phone's quick settings menu, media playback controls and the time and battery level. Although the handset is only a concept design right now, CNET's Lisa Eadicicco points out that it might offer a hint at the future of devices that roll, flex, bend, fold and otherwise contort to adapt tech to our unique needs.\nGet to work with this gaming laptop\nMore and more, we're asking our laptops to do double duty. In addition to strong gaming performance, we want to be able to use these thinner, lightweight devices for work or school. The HP Omen Transcend 14, which made its debut at CES 2024, is light enough for a daily commute but sports a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display with a 48-120Hz variable refresh rate backed up by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070.\nThe 14-inch laptop weighs only 3.6 pounds (1.6 kilograms) -- light for a gaming laptop and has battery life good for up to 11.5 hours with the integrated graphics and an Eco mode. The new 14-inch size starts at $1,500. A 16-inch version will also be available with the option for a 4K 240Hz OLED starting at $1,900.\nThis thermometer also checks your heart and lungs\nIf you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer,\nelectrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was\nunveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you \"beam it,\" the device can give you clues about your health.\nThe device, which Withings describes as being \"portable and smaller than a smartphone,\"\ncombines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of\nthe wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like\nblood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used\nas a \"digital stethoscope.\"\nFollowing expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nForget a projector, get a huge TCL instead\nThe TCL 115QM891G is a 115-inch TV that's 8.5 feet wide and around 6 feet tall on its stand.\nCNET's projector reviewer Geoff Morrison has been extolling the benefits of projectors for many years, but even he has come around to technologies like OLED and Mini-LED of late. What would he think of the new TCL 115QM891G? This is a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's up to five times brighter than most TVs, and with better blacks too, according to TV reviewer David Katzmaier.\nAs TV reviewers ourselves we've seen large TVs, but in the old days they were stuck at HD. The pixels on Panasonic's\u00a0103-inch 1080p, for instance, were huge and easily noticeable. This is why 4K technology is so great -- it means you can install a TV as big as a wall, and not see black lines between the pixels. The TCL is also going to be a lot cheaper than that $100,000 Panasonic too, at under $20,000.\nStained glass gets a new lease on lifelong power\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nSolar panels are great -- they produce electricity from one of the most abundant resources we have, and they pay for themselves in quick order -- but no one has ever called them pretty. Fear not! Japanese company inQs has worked out a way to make solar cells out of colored glass. The company is exhibiting a number of objects at CES 2024, including a\u00a0stained glass pane that generates electricity. The devices are small, and one was able to power only a desk fan, but we like how they point to a rethink of how solar panels should look and work.\nDisguising weird-looking things has been a perpetual trend at CES, as with LG's ArtCool air conditioners. And this year the Samsung Music Frame lets you put art inside a smart speaker.\nHey, Ida, which is better: Alexa or Siri?\nAI is already everywhere here at CES 2024 -- and adding to the list of products it'll be appearing in is cars. Volkswagen has announced a deal with ChatGPT that\u00a0enables users to ask all sorts of questions of their car, in the same way they would of a traditional digital assistant. At the moment, VW's voice assistant lets users say, \"Hey, Ida,\" to ask a question about something basic, like requesting tire pressure. But the automaker's cars are incapable of answering more advanced questions like, \"When did the New York Jets last win the Super Bowl?\" Under the new deal, if the car's assistant can't answer the question, it'll hand off the query to ChatGPT. (Yes, the Jets did win one. But it was a very, very long time ago.)\nIt's worth noting that competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri have been completing these queries natively for many years, so teaming with ChatGPT is an easier way for VW's Ida to catch up.\nMust-see-through TV\nThis transparent display, currently showing fish, can transform into a 77-inch TV.\nTVs are getting bigger every year, which means there's a bigger slab of black plastic taking up a significant portion of the living room wall when it's not in use. But what if we could make it disappear, without actually pulling it off the wall?\nLG has apparently done just that with a\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0that converts from a \"fish tank\" to a 77-inch television (pictured above). Unlike Samsung's competing technology this will apparently be a real product, shipping later in 2024.\nMeanwhile Samsung is showing off the first transparent version of its\u00a0Micro-LED display tech\u00a0at\u00a0CES 2024. While transparent OLED and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, Samsung says its Micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the current tech. But Samsung says its transparent Micro-LED tech isn't available in the market, so what Katzmaier saw (or didn't see?) is essentially a concept.\nA 2-minute ice cream maker\nWe scream for ice cream.\nComing soon to a restaurant near you: freshly made ice cream, ready from start to finish in just 2 minutes.\nWe've loved trying the vanilla ice cream churned out by the speedy ColdSnap -- first in 2021 and then again this year. We're still a year away from being able to buy one of these innovative ice cream makers for our homes, but the company came to CES this year with the news that its restaurant partners will have hold of the machines much sooner.\nThe countertop ice cream maker uses Keurig-like pods to make a bowl of the cold stuff in less than 2 minutes. The finished result has a gelato-like consistency that had us coming back for more every time we passed the ColdSnap booth.\nRobot stain fighter\nSamsung is set to unveil its Bespoke Jet Bot Combo this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nHere's a product sure to clean up -- literally. Samsung's new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, a smart robot vacuum with a mop, does more than just get rid of dust bunnies and dog hair. It's designed to roam your rooms scouting for stains on hard flooring and scrub them out so you don't have to.\nThe robot taps AI-powered object recognition to identify stains on hard flooring. Yes, it can tell the difference between the surfaces, presumably making adjustments to its cleaning technique accordingly. You can also tell this likely $1,000-plus household helper where it can and can't go as it attacks stains as bad as a puppy piddle or a zinfandel spill with a spinning mop that hits 170 rpm. (Pricing details aren't yet available.)\nTeeth tech\nAI isn't just helping keep your floors clean, it's also being used to make sure your teeth are as clean as they can be. The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush features an algorithm-controlled motor, five brush modes tailored to specific needs, an interactive touchscreen that shows you areas you missed and, brilliantly/weirdly, an AI voice guide that speaks into your brain via bone conduction to help you improve your technique.\nIt also features Wi-Fi connectivity so you can pair it with your home network, and it will store information about your brushing history until you can download it to your app. It also offers 40 days of battery life through wireless charging. It will go on sale in the US in the fall for $130.\nIt's all in the wristwatch remote\nWhat if your smartwatch could also control your lamps, your Netflix programs and more?\nImagine using your wrist to control everything around you. A flick this way, and you can turn off the lights or scroll through the offerings on Netflix. Finnish startup Doublepoint has developed software that can turn an Android watch into a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection.\nThe software will come to developers in the first half of this year,\nbut it's up to developers and app-makers to decide what a small gesture, such as tapping fingers or rotating your wrist, will actually do.\nSteven Musil, Sareena Dayaram, Katie Collins and Ty Pendlebury contributed to this article.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

        "raw_content": "NorthWestern Energy enters contracts for 325 megawatts of dispatchable capacity resources to serve Montana customers\nApril 20, 2021 20:00 ET\n| Source:\nNorthWestern Corporation\nNorthWestern Corporation\nBUTTE, Mont., April\n20, 2021\n(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- NorthWestern Energy has entered into multiple contracts for projects to acquire 325 megawatts of dispatchable capacity resources: procurement and construction agreements for a 175 megawatt natural gas plant; a pending agreement to purchase capacity from a 50 megawatt battery storage project; and a power purchase agreement for 100 megawatts of predominantly hydroelectric resources.\nThe contracts were entered into after NorthWestern Energy completed its competitive solicitation process for long-term capacity resources issued in January 2020.\nThis will reduce NorthWestern Energy\u2019s capacity deficit, decrease risk associated with market volatility and potential lack of availability, and provide increased reliability for our Montana customers. The additional capacity to produce energy will address more than half of NorthWestern Energy\u2019s deficit in its supply portfolio serving Montana. The deficit is becoming more critical as some regional coal plants and other capacity resources are being shut down, compromising reliability during extreme weather conditions, including multi-day events, when energy demand is high.\nNorthWestern Energy\u2019s independent, third-party request for proposals evaluator, Aion Energy, received 180 proposals representing a wide variety of technologies from 21 bidders. NorthWestern Energy has selected three resources from the proposals submitted in response to the company\u2019s request for proposals:\n\u201cThis selection of diverse projects will provide critically needed flexible capacity from a combination of thermal and renewable resources,\u201d said NorthWestern Energy Vice President Supply and Montana Government Relations John Hines.\nThe selected resources provide diversity in ownership and technology, including owned and market-based resources and the largest battery-storage project within Montana.\n\u201cThis resource portfolio addresses a key portion of our immediate need for generation capacity while also allowing us to make progress toward our goal of an energy supply portfolio in Montana that reduces the carbon intensity of our electric generation by 90% by 2045,\u201d said NorthWestern Energy Chief Executive Officer Bob Rowe.\nNorthWestern Energy expects to submit an application for approval of the Laurel Generating Station and the 20-year contract for the pending Energy Storage Project to the Montana Public Service Commission on or about May 14, 2021. We anticipate the regulatory process to take approximately 9 months.\nThe $250 million Laurel Generating Station is expected to be available to serve customers by Jan. 3, 2024.\nFor the 175 megawatt natural gas-fired RICE plant near Laurel, Caterpillar Power Generation Systems, LLC, a subsidiary of Caterpillar, Inc. will supply the RICE units and Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. was selected as the Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contractor. Burns & McDonnell has a solid reputation as a superior EPC contractor, particularly for RICE facilities.\nThe Caterpillar RICE units are highly reliable and efficient with low emissions. The selected engines are capable of rapid ramping and multiple daily starts and stops. These units have the flexibility to provide power on-demand, baseload power, flexible capacity, and regulation services. These characteristics will facilitate the integration of existing and new intermittent renewable energy resources into our portfolio.\nThe 50 megawatt battery energy storage system, is expected to be available to serve NorthWestern Energy\u2019s Montana customers by the end of 2023.\n\u201cThe energy storage project will provide the opportunity to store some excess energy from the grid to use when customer demand is high,\u201d NorthWestern Energy Director Long-Term Resources Bleau LaFave said. \u201cToday, NorthWestern Energy most frequently has excess energy on the grid from wind resources. Now we will have the opportunity to store a portion of that excess energy to improve matching the generation with customer demand and higher market pricing.\u201d\n\u201cThe five-year 100 megawatt power purchase agreement with Powerex, the marketing entity for BC Hydro, will provide our customers with capacity mainly from the BC Hydro system starting in Jan. 1, 2023\u201d said LaFave. \u201cOur Montana customers require this capacity as soon as it is available. This market product can be delivered on our existing transmission assets.\u201d\nNorthWestern Energy is still short of the capacity resources needed to produce energy reliably at the times when our Montana customers require it the most.\n\u201cThe 2020 RFP process provided an opportunity to see what projects and technology are available,\u201d said NorthWestern Energy President and Chief Operating Officer Brian Bird. \u201cNorthWestern Energy\u2019s new Laurel Generating Station will be able to provide on-demand capacity for long durations. With that asset added to our Montana portfolio, NorthWestern Energy can consider other, shorter duration capacity projects in future RFPs.\u201d\n\u201cDeveloping a diverse portfolio of resources capable of producing the energy our Montana customers need any time they need it is the responsible path forward as we all work together toward an affordable, reliable and cleaner energy future,\u201d said Rowe.\nFollow us on Facebook or on Twitter (@NWEinfo).\nAbout NorthWestern Energy (Nasdaq: NWE)NorthWestern provides electricity and / or natural gas to approximately 743,000 customers in Montana, South Dakota, and Nebraska. We have generated and distributed electricity in South Dakota and distributed natural gas in South Dakota and Nebraska since 1923 and have generated and distributed electricity and distributed natural gas in Montana since 2002. More information on NorthWestern is available on the company\u2019s website at www.northwesternenergy.com."

        "raw_content": "How to make LED transparent screens more energy-efficient\nAs society rapidly advances, various industries are advocating for the production of environmentally friendly products, and the LED industry is no exception. LED transparent screens have been widely used in various corners of the city and have become a unique symbol to enhance the city\u2019s image and beautify its appearance. The LED industry should keep pace with the times, respond to the national call, and promote energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products. It is well-known that LED display screens may not achieve ideal energy efficiency due to their high brightness, but that does not mean they must be high-energy-consumption products. So, how can LED transparent screens be more energy-efficient?\nChoosing environmentally friendly materials Selecting an LED display screen made of environmentally friendly materials, processed through special techniques, eliminates the need for glue, achieving waterproof, dustproof, and UV-resistant properties for the screen. Compared to products produced with conventional processes, this approach consumes fewer materials, making it more environmentally friendly.\nConstant Current Noise Reduction Technology The LED display driver chip adopts an internationally advanced LED display dedicated chip system, leading the industry in the field of full-color LED displays. Combining its chip characteristics, constant current noise reduction technology has been developed to ensure that the impact of power supply and other noise sources on LED electronic displays is reduced to a minimum. Some driver ICs can also save energy by reducing the original 5V voltage to 4.2V, achieving energy-saving functionality.\nUtilizing an Automatic Brightness Adjustment System Depending on day and night, different locations, and time periods, slight changes in the brightness of the display screen can have a significant impact. If the playback brightness of the LED display screen is greater than fifty percent of the ambient brightness, we will clearly feel eye discomfort, causing \u201clight pollution.\nMulti-level Gray Correction TechnologyConventional LED display systems use an 18-bit color display hierarchy. In some low gray levels and color transitions, colors may appear harsh, resulting in discomfort with colored light adaptation. The new LED large screen control system adopts a 14-bit color display hierarchy, significantly improving the color transition hardness, making colors feel softer, and avoiding discomfort with light when people watch.\nPower Supply The realization of energy-saving LED displays primarily focuses on the power supply. Directly adopting a half-bridge or full-bridge high-efficiency switch power supply on the existing LED display, combined with synchronous rectification, produces a significant energy-saving effect. In the constant current state of the driving IC, efforts are made to minimize the power supply voltage, achieving a better energy-saving effect by separately supplying power to the red, green, and blue tubes.\nWatsApp\uff1a\nE-mail\uff1a\nMarketing Center\uff1a4th Floor East, Building 4, Shenzhen Software Park, No.2 Gaoxinzhong 2nd Road, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, P.R.China\nProduction Base\uff1aRoom 401,Building G,Guancheng Low Carbon Industrial Park,Shangcun Community,\nGongming Street, Guangming District, Shenzhen,Guangdong,China\n\u00a9 2024 Shenzhen MUXWAVE\u00a0 Technology Co., Ltd.\nAll Rights Reserved \u7ca4ICP\u59072022137224\u53f7\nLinksLED display | LED holographic screen\nUsername or email\u00a0*\nPassword\u00a0*\nRemember me\nLogin\nLost your password?"

(Kayhan Ostovar/Yellowstone River Research Center at Rocky Mountain College via AP)\nLAUREL, Mont. (AP) \u2014 Tar balls have shown up 100 miles (161 kilometers) downstream of a railroad bridge collapse last month that sent numerous tank cars carrying petroleum products plummeting into Montana\u2019s Yellowstone River, officials said Friday, as dropping water levels and rising temperatures hinder cleanup work.\nMore than 66 tons (60 metric tonnes) of the black, gooey stuff have been removed from the river since the June 24 accident, officials said. Most of the spilled material \u2014 a binder for asphalt that sticks to river rocks and gets harder to handle as it warms \u2014 is expected to get left behind.\nCleanup crews working this week on an island near the town of Laurel pulled long, taffy-like pieces of the asphalt from among the river rocks. They used shovels to pull apart sandbanks where receding water levels revealed pockets of contamination. The globs \u2014 along with some rocks and sand \u2014 were bagged for disposal and carried away by power boat.\nNavigating the river is getting harder by the day for the boats being used in the cleanup. And when temperatures peak in the afternoons, the asphalt becomes too soft to pick up, curtailing work. Smaller clumps and some asphalt enmeshed in river rocks will be left behind.\n\u201cSome of this oil will be left here,\u201d said Andrew Graham, an environmental scientist and consultant for the cleanup. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we\u2019re going to get all of the asphalt off of the river....We\u2019re really looking at the stuff that we can peel up and getting the bulk of the product off.\u201d\nTar mats and tar balls from the spill have been found at more than three dozen locations, according to government records. That includes where the river passes through Montana\u2019s largest city, Billings. The farthest site downstream is near Pompey\u2019s Pillar National Monument.\nMontana Rail Link of Missoula operated the train and is responsible for the cleanup.\nThe company predicted immediately after the spill that the petroleum products would \u201csolidify rapidly.\u201d Authorities now say the material could take much longer to harden.\nMontana Rail Link is being acquired by Texas-based BNSF in a deal that will be finalized next year. Work to repair the bridge is ongoing and service along the route is expected to resume in coming days, Montana Rail Link spokesperson Andy Garland said.\nState officials are preparing to notify Montana Rail Link that the spill violated Montana pollution laws, said Montana Department of Environmental Quality spokesperson Kevin Stone. The agency still is considering its enforcement options, and hasn\u2019t yet determined at what point it will declare the cleanup sufficient, Stone said.\nThe Environmental Protection Agency previously estimated up to 250 tons (227 metric tonnes) of oil product entered the river from six asphalt binder tank cars. Agency spokesperson Beth Archer said Friday that officials still were determining a final figure. Garland did not respond to questions about the size of the spill.\nSeven snakes and seven birds have been killed after coming into contact with tar mats or tar balls. One snake was cleaned and released.\nYet officials say the material is fairly benign if not touched and doesn\u2019t pose a long-term health threat for the people who boat, swim and fish in the Yellowstone.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a fouling issue,\u201d said Graham. \u201cOnce it gets on you, your body temperature will warm it up and it gets sticky. You need to use baby oil to get it off. It\u2019s very difficult to get off with soap and water.\u201d\nNo drinking water contamination has been found.\nA smaller amount of molten sulfur spilled from three tank cars. It hardened after being released and very little has been found on the river, according to Archer and others involved in the cleanup.\nThe cause of the bridge collapse remains under investigation, said Federal Railroad Administration spokesperson Daniel Green.\nIt happened at a time when the river was swollen with melting mountain snow and following a torrential rainfall. Yellowstone National Park is about 130 miles (209 kilometers) upstream and wasn\u2019t impacted.\nThe derailment marked the Yellowstone\u2019s third large petroleum spill in recent years, following crude oil pipeline breaks in 2011 and 2015. The Yellowstone has a shifting channel and its river bed can become severely scoured during flooding such as the region experienced last year.\nExperts say those forces could have made the railroad bridge more unstable and contributed to its collapse.\nNo one was injured, but the accident added to growing scrutiny of the rail industry brought on by high-profile accidents including a February derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, that sparked a fire and evacuations and led to the eventual burning of hazardous materials to prevent an uncontrolled explosion.\nUnion leaders say freight train inspections are happening less often and are not as thorough as in the past due to staff cuts and time constraints.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "raw_content": "How to make LED transparent screens more energy-efficient\nAs society rapidly advances, various industries are advocating for the production of environmentally friendly products, and the LED industry is no exception. LED transparent screens have been widely used in various corners of the city and have become a unique symbol to enhance the city\u2019s image and beautify its appearance. The LED industry should keep pace with the times, respond to the national call, and promote energy-efficient and environmentally friendly products. It is well-known that LED display screens may not achieve ideal energy efficiency due to their high brightness, but that does not mean they must be high-energy-consumption products. So, how can LED transparent screens be more energy-efficient?\nChoosing environmentally friendly materials Selecting an LED display screen made of environmentally friendly materials, processed through special techniques, eliminates the need for glue, achieving waterproof, dustproof, and UV-resistant properties for the screen. Compared to products produced with conventional processes, this approach consumes fewer materials, making it more environmentally friendly.\nConstant Current Noise Reduction Technology The LED display driver chip adopts an internationally advanced LED display dedicated chip system, leading the industry in the field of full-color LED displays. Combining its chip characteristics, constant current noise reduction technology has been developed to ensure that the impact of power supply and other noise sources on LED electronic displays is reduced to a minimum. Some driver ICs can also save energy by reducing the original 5V voltage to 4.2V, achieving energy-saving functionality.\nUtilizing an Automatic Brightness Adjustment System Depending on day and night, different locations, and time periods, slight changes in the brightness of the display screen can have a significant impact. If the playback brightness of the LED display screen is greater than fifty percent of the ambient brightness, we will clearly feel eye discomfort, causing \u201clight pollution.\nMulti-level Gray Correction TechnologyConventional LED display systems use an 18-bit color display hierarchy. In some low gray levels and color transitions, colors may appear harsh, resulting in discomfort with colored light adaptation. The new LED large screen control system adopts a 14-bit color display hierarchy, significantly improving the color transition hardness, making colors feel softer, and avoiding discomfort with light when people watch.\nPower Supply The realization of energy-saving LED displays primarily focuses on the power supply. Directly adopting a half-bridge or full-bridge high-efficiency switch power supply on the existing LED display, combined with synchronous rectification, produces a significant energy-saving effect. In the constant current state of the driving IC, efforts are made to minimize the power supply voltage, achieving a better energy-saving effect by separately supplying power to the red, green, and blue tubes.\nWatsApp\uff1a\nE-mail\uff1a\nMarketing Center\uff1a4th Floor East, Building 4, Shenzhen Software Park, No.2 Gaoxinzhong 2nd Road, Nanshan District, Shenzhen, P.R.China\nProduction Base\uff1aRoom 401,Building G,Guancheng Low Carbon Industrial Park,Shangcun Community,\nGongming Street, Guangming District, Shenzhen,Guangdong,China\n\u00a9 2024 Shenzhen MUXWAVE\u00a0 Technology Co., Ltd.\nAll Rights Reserved \u7ca4ICP\u59072022137224\u53f7\nLinksLED display | LED holographic screen\n\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0633\u062a\u062e\u062f\u0645 \u0623\u0648 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0631\u064a\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0625\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0631\u0648\u0646\u064a\u00a0*\n\u0643\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0631\u0648\u0631\u00a0*\n\u062a\u0630\u0643\u0631\u0646\u064a\n\u062a\u0633\u062c\u064a\u0644 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u062e\u0648\u0644\n\u0646\u0633\u064a\u062a \u0643\u0644\u0645\u0629 \u0645\u0631\u0648\u0631\u0643\u061f"
