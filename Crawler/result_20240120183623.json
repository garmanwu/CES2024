Exhibition time: January 9-12, 2024, Exhibition location: Las Vegas, NV 89109, United States - Las Vegas Convention Center. More than 150 countries and regions, 4,000+ enterprises and institutions participated in the exhibition, and more than 130,000 people attended the exhibition.\nSurrounding the four major themes, the word that appears most often is \"AI\". When various exhibitors promoted their flagship products, \"AI\" was also a word they mentioned repeatedly. Gospell also responded to this theme this time, bringing Smart Frame with wifi camera Kit products, AI smart cameras, smart inspection cameras and other products to make a shining debut at the 2024 CES show!\nIPC\u00a0Series\nThere are many types of AI cameras, but this one must be very different from the ones you usually come into contact with. This is an AI smart camera that does not require power connection, has multiple installation methods, and can make video calls at any time. It can be monitored through a smartphone and has built-in Lithium battery, easy to install, and can be used for up, down, left, and right wide-angle viewing. It supports two-way voice and video call functions. It can conduct remote conversations and video calls. It also supports 5m infrared night vision. A power outage will not affect the normal operation of the camera.\nSurveillance kits series\nHave you ever tried changing photos by touching a photo frame? Based on the concept of smart photo frames, Gospell has developed a touchable photo frame that supports vertical/horizontal placement. You can view photos or videos on the frame, or view surveillance images and videos on your mobile phone. It is easy to watch and can be cloud-enabled. The camera can be viewed up, down, left, and right at a wide angle. The photo frame can be connected to the camera and doorbell at the same time, or can be connected to one of them separately for free combination to build a safe and warm home environment for you.\nBorescope series\nWith the widespread application of intelligent AI, industrial borescopes have also begun to have new functions. This is a 5-inch IPS color display that can also support remote viewing on a mobile phone, an 8mm mini waterproof camera, and a 1-meter The inspection camera of the extension tube is waterproof up to IP67 and can be used for picture capture. It is equipped with three accessories: hook, magnet and mirror. It can be used in some hard-to-reach scenes such as pipes and sewers.
