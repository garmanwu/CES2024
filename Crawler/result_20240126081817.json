        "raw_content": "OliverIQ Debuts with Smart Home as a Service Subscription Model\nOliverIQ's SHaaS model will be rolled out in different incarnations depending on several factors for the consumer. (Courtesy of OliverIQ)\nOliverIQ Debuts with Smart Home as a Service Subscription Model\nThe creators of Control4 are hoping to work their smart home magic again, announcing the official debut of their latest endeavor, OliverIQ, at CES 2024 in Las Vegas. Developed by Control4 co-founders Will West and Eric Smith, OliverIQ is a Smart Home as a Service (SHaaS) platform featuring a subscription model with unlimited support and a user-friendly app for control and automation of popular smart home devices.\nPartnering with national and global service providers, OliverIQ aims to scale their SHaaS platform rapidly, providing product support, unlimited online and phone support, in-home assistance, and security system monitoring, the company explains.\nOliverIQ Platform Is Agnostic with Devices & Communications Protocols\nThe SHaaS software can be embedded in common household devices such as routers, set top boxes, or the OliverIQ hub. It\u2019s supported by an easy-to-use application with access to around-the-clock technical support. The company is\u00a0partnering with ISPs, security providers, builders, and major home retailers to sell and service subscriptions.\n\u201cWhen we started Control4, our intent and thought was we wanted to bring smart home automation and benefits to the broader market; certainly not everyone, but the broader market than what was achievable at the time. In many ways, what we want to do now is complete that vision, to make it accessible, and the world has really changed enough that we think it is possible,\u201d West, OliverIQ\u2019s CEO, stated in a pre-CES call.\n\u201cThink about the differences in the market when we started Control4 and now \u2013 it\u2019s an unrecognizable landscape. There were virtually none of what\u2019s available today,\u201d West added, noting devices such as the Nest thermostat, Ring video doorbell and the millions of smart speakers installed in people\u2019s homes.\nThe Future of Digital Lighting & Control\n\u201cSo why isn\u2019t that good enough? And the answer is, it\u2019s not good enough because when you put all these devices in your home \u2026 most people have eight apps, 10 apps for controlling various things. It\u2019s separate control, it\u2019s not automation. Automation is when you things together to create a better lifestyle using the devices in your home working together.\u201d\nWest notes that making a cohesive system out of myriad IoT devices can get complicated. The OliverIQ solution communicates with the connected devices in the home through a multiprotocol platform \u2013 owners can use any devices, from any manufacturer or protocols including RF technology, Google, Apple, Amazon, Samsung, Wi-Fi, Matter, Thread, Z-Wave, and Zigbee.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just the fact that you\u2019ve got all [these protocols and devices] going on in your home, it\u2019s that every one of these manufacturers is doing updates whenever they want,\u201d West adds. \u201cSamsung is not checking with Google before updating the drivers to their televisions. Nobody coordinates with anybody else, and the reality is when you put a bunch of devices in your home, stuff happens.\u201d\nThe SHaaS model addresses these complexities and maintenance challenges typically associated with smart home setups, according to the company. Customers don\u2019t to navigate the daunting process of integrating multiple devices or managing ongoing maintenance. OliverIQ handles everything from initial setup, automation, software updates, to troubleshooting \u2013 all managed via their app.\nAccording to the company, its app can communicate with over 90% of the most popular off-the-shelf smart devices in the market.\nSimple-to-Access Support Makes OliverIQ SHaaS Attractive\nOliverIQ\u2019s SHaaS solution \u2013 a business model paid through the service provider \u2013 offers the technical service and support homeowners need to build, program, and maintain a truly smart home. Support is ongoing, not a one-and-done install, so functionalities don\u2019t degrade and they always have the latest updates.\n\u201cWe\u2019re breaking down the barriers in the smart home,\u201d says Smith, CTO of OliverIQ. \u201cOur platform is designed to bring the convenience and lifestyle of a fully automated home to a broader audience at an affordable price point, with at-your-service technical support.\u201d\nHomeowners get unlimited technical support calls, as well as access to the company\u2019s Knowledge Center. Tech support teams can offer guidance remotely via a phone or computer screen, and perform remote device takeovers to troubleshoot issues for the customer.\nRelated: \u2018Custom Integration as a Service\u2019 Creates Compelling Value Case\nIf a problem can\u2019t be solved through remote support, the service provider can deliver in-person service, with the cost of the initial visit applied toward any required repairs.\nThe new company will also offer a sub-$100 standalone multiprotocol hub that can be added into home systems where another hardware device for embedding OliverIQ is not present.\nThrough their service provider partners, OliverIQ is building the scale to support homes nationwide, with pricing based on the services requested, the different markets service providers work in, and other variables.\n\u201cThe reason we started the company is that right now there\u2019s only three ways to get home automation \u2013 you can do Crestron, Control4, Savant, great stuff; integrators do a great job and give you a great system. You can get a Comcast or ADT or Vivint smart security with a smart doorbell and they call it a smart home. And the third choice is you\u2019re on your own, do it yourselves,\u201d Smith says.\n\u201cWe all have plumbing, we all have HVAC and electrical in our homes and we don\u2019t pay people $200,000 to install that for us. There are contractors willing to do that for reasonable prices for the broader market, and we felt like average consumers need help doing this. So we thought let\u2019s build a platform where consumers don\u2019t need to do it themselves, but they also don\u2019t need to do it at a $100,000 level.\u201d\nOliverIQ is currently in beta with select partners in the U.S. and will be in market by Q2 2024.\nIf you enjoyed this article and want to receive more valuable industry content like this, click here to sign up for our digital newsletters!\nARTICLE TOPICS\nARTICLE TAGS\nSHARE\nSHOW NEWSLETTER\nCE Pro\nContent Types\nNewsProductsProjectsCompaniesDownloadsWebcastsPodcastsEvents\nSpecials\nCompany Info\nAboutContact UsCustomer ServiceAdvertise with Us\nSubscribe\nConnect\nTwitterFacebookLinkedInYouTubeRSS Feed\nCategories"

OliverIQ helps its partners fill the gaps, becoming full-service home automation heroes in the eyes of their customers,\u201dsaid West, CEO and cofounder of OliverIQ.\nWest explained that, in the current landscape, there are three options for constructing a smart home: hire a professional integrator to create a custom system, with costs starting in the mid-five figures; install a home security system that can integrate with a limited selection of other connected devices \u2013 more \u201csmart access\u201d than \u201csmart home;\u201d or pour endless hours into building it yourself out of an ever-growing assortment of DIY connected devices.\nThe DIY smart home sector is both the largest and the most troubled, OliverIQ contends. Consumers are overwhelmed with the sheer number of connected devices in their homes, each requiring its own distinct application for management. Managing DIY connected devices individually is annoying. Getting them to work together is nearly impossible. And, even if a consumer manages the impossible, something breaks.\nOliverIQ says that \u201csmart home decay\u201d is inevitable \u2014 wear and tear, battery death, firmware updates, etc. cause devices to suddenly and unpredictably stop working together. Connected devices have an average lifespan of 6-8 years, but there are so many of them in the average home, and there are so many software updates by manufacturers, that devices and connections between devices go offline regularly. You\u2019re never done setting up a smart home because it must be constantly maintained, OliverIQ pointed out. This complexity is way beyond the capability and desire of typical consumers to manage.\nOliverIQ\u2019s SHaaS solution offers the technical service and support needed by homeowners to build, program, and maintain a truly smart home.\u00a0Support is ongoing, not a one-and-done install, so smart home functionality doesn\u2019t degrade over time. This, the company says, is affordable, complete smart home support for everyone.\n\u201cWith OliverIQ, we\u2019re breaking down the barriers in the smart home,\u201d said Smith, CTO and cofounder of OliverIQ. \u201cOur platform is designed to bring the convenience and lifestyle of a fully automated home to a broader audience at an affordable price point, with at-your-service technical support.\u201d\nThe SHaaS model addresses the complexities and maintenance challenges typically associated with smart home setups. Consumers no longer need to navigate the cumbersome process of integrating multiple devices or managing ongoing maintenance. OliverIQ handles everything from initial setup, automation, software updates, to troubleshooting \u2014 all managed seamlessly through an app.\nHomeowners get unlimited technical support calls, as well as access to OliverIQ\u2019s Knowledge Center. Consumers get one number to call for help with any connected device. OliverIQ\u2019s technical support teams then can offer guidance remotely via a phone or computer screen and perform remote device takeovers to troubleshoot issues for the homeowner.\nIf a problem cannot be solved through remote technical support, the service provider can deliver low-cost in-person service, with the cost of the initial visit applied toward any required repairs. OliverIQ operates on a subscription-based business model that is paid through the service provider. OliverIQ communicates with the connected devices in the home through a multiprotocol platform, which can be embedded in the service provider\u2019s router, cable box, or other devices.\nOliverIQ will also offer a sub-$100 standalone multi-protocol hub that can be added into home systems where another hardware device for embedding OliverIQ is not present.\nSo, why has a service like this never been offered before? \u201cThere has never before been a provider with the expertise to succeed at integration, and the scale to succeed at support,\u201d West stated.\nHaving a set of smart devices across your home doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a smart home but having a set of interconnected smart devices does. Integrating connected devices so that they work together is a significant technical challenge. The modern connected home essentially needs \u201can IT department.\u201d\nThere are dozens of RF standards and protocols, including Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Thread, Matter, Z-Wave, Zigbee, etc., as well as proprietary ecosystems. Some manufacturers intentionally build walled gardens, aiming to lock consumers into their device ecosystems. Smart home automation requires integrating new and existing devices regardless of RF technology or manufacturer. With OliverIQ embedded in an ISP\u2019s router or with the OliverIQ multi-protocol hub, the OliverIQ app can communicate with more than 90% of the most popular off-the-shelf smart devices in the market today.\nThrough their service provider partners, OliverIQ is building the scale to support homes nationwide. Service has always been the crucial missing piece for a successful smart home experience. OliverIQ is partnering with regional and national providers who can provide virtual and in-home support. This scale keeps per-customer costs low, making home automation an affordable option for more people.\nService providers can offer their customers ease, convenience, and security, according to OliverIQ. They enable homeowners to remotely accept in-home deliveries and services. They give them one number to call whenever they need help with their connected devices.\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating sticky relationships between homeowners and services providers,\u201d West said. \u201cCustomers won\u2019t give up their smart home for a slightly lower monthly internet bill. With OliverIQ, today\u2019s leading in-home service providers have a powerful platform for selling, servicing, and delivering high-demand solutions throughout today\u2019s connected homes.\u201d\nOliverIQ is currently in beta with select partners in the U.S. and will be in market by Q2 2024. OliverIQ will be sold as a subscription model through ISPs, home center retailers, security providers, and builders.\nVisit OliverIQ at CES booth 51932 in the Venetian Expo.\nEmporia Launches New Program to Simplify EV Charger Installation\nSnap One Advisory Board Members Offer Control4 Connect, Assist Insights\nPhilips Hue Additions Expand DIY Lighting Design Options\nLeave a Reply Cancel reply\nYou must be logged in to post a comment.\nI'm a CEDIA Member\n1750 Wewatta Street, #1821, Denver CO,\u00a0 80202 | 720.476.4920\n\u00a9 Residential Tech Today 2022.

And, even if a consumer manages the impossible, something breaks.\nSmart home decay is inevitable:\u00a0 wear and tear, battery death, firmware updates, etc. cause devices to suddenly and unpredictably stop working together. Connected devices have an average lifespan of 6-8 years, but there are so many of them in the average home, and there are so many software updates by manufacturers, that devices and connections between devices go offline regularly. You\u2019re never done setting up a smart home \u2013 it must be constantly maintained. This complexity is way beyond the capability and desire of typical consumers to manage.\nOliverIQ\u2019s SHaaS solution offers the technical service and support homeowners have always needed to build, program, and maintain a truly smart home. Support is ongoing, not a one-and-done install, so smart home functionality doesn\u2019t degrade over time. This is affordable, complete smart home support for everyone.\n\u201cWith OliverIQ, we\u2019re breaking down the barriers in the smart home,\u201d said Eric Smith, CTO and cofounder of OliverIQ. \u201cOur platform is designed to bring the convenience and lifestyle of a fully automated home to a broader audience at an affordable price point, with at-your-service technical support.\u201d\nThe SHaaS model addresses the complexities and maintenance challenges typically associated with smart home setups. Consumers no longer need to navigate the cumbersome process of integrating multiple devices or managing ongoing maintenance. OliverIQ handles everything from initial setup, automation, software updates, to troubleshooting \u2013 all managed seamlessly through their intuitive app.\nHomeowners get unlimited technical support calls, as well as access to OliverIQ\u2019s comprehensive Knowledge Center. Consumers get one, trusted number to call for help with any connected device. OliverIQ\u2019s technical support teams can offer guidance remotely via a phone or computer screen, and perform remote device takeovers to troubleshoot issues for the homeowner. If a problem cannot be solved through remote technical support, the service provider can deliver low-cost in-person service, with the cost of the initial visit applied towards any required repairs. OliverIQ operates on a subscription-based business model that is paid through the service provider. OliverIQ communicates with the connected devices in the home through a multiprotocol platform, which can be embedded in the service provider\u2019s router, cable box, or other devices. OliverIQ will also offer a sub-$100 standalone multi-protocol hub that can be added into home systems where another hardware device for embedding OliverIQ is not present.\nWhy it\u2019s Never Been Done Before\n\u201cThere has never before been a provider with the expertise to succeed at integration, and the scale to succeed at support,\u201d stated West.\nHaving a set of smart devices across your home doesn\u2019t necessarily make it a smart home, but having a set of interconnected smart devices does. Integrating connected devices so that they work together is a significant technical challenge. The modern connected home needs an IT department. There are dozens of RF standards and protocols, including WiFi, Bluetooth, Thread, Matter, Z-Wave, Zigbee, etc., as well as proprietary ecosystems. Some manufacturers intentionally build walled gardens, aiming to lock consumers into their device ecosystems. Smart home automation requires integrating new and existing devices regardless of RF technology or manufacturer. With OliverIQ embedded in an ISP\u2019s router or with the OliverIQ multi-protocol hub, the OliverIQ app can communicate with over 90% of the most popular off-the-shelf smart devices in the market today.\nThrough their service provider partners, OliverIQ is building the scale to support homes nationwide. Service has always been the crucial missing piece for a successful smart home experience. OliverIQ is partnering with regional and national providers who can provide virtual and in-home support. This scale keeps per-customer costs low, finally making home automation an affordable option for everyone.\nWith OliverIQ, service providers bring their customers ease, convenience, and security. They enable homeowners to remotely accept in-home deliveries and services. They give them one number to call whenever they need help with their connected devices.\n\u201cWe\u2019re creating sticky relationships between homeowners and services providers,\u201d said West.\u00a0 \u201cCustomers won\u2019t give up their smart home for a slightly lower monthly Internet bill. With OliverIQ, today\u2019s leading in-home service providers have a powerful platform for selling, servicing, and delivering high-demand solutions throughout today\u2019s connected homes.\u201d\nOliverIQ\u2019s launch at CES 2024 demonstrates its commitment to innovation, customer satisfaction, and ease of use. The platform is set to transform how homeowners interact with smart technology, making it a hassle-free, enjoyable part of everyday life. OliverIQ is currently in beta with select partners in the U.S. and will be in market by Q2 2024. OliverIQ will be sold as a subscription model through ISPs, home center retailers, security providers, and builders.\nFor more information about OliverIQ and its revolutionary SHaaS platform, visit OliverIQ at CES booth #51932 in the Venetian Expo or oliveriq.com.\n513 Broadway, Suite 319, Newport, RI 02840 | 401-792-7080\nPrivacy policy"

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nBest of CES 2024: ZDNET editors' top picks\nThe ZDNET team scoured CES 2024 to find the most innovative new tech and the most exciting new products to share with our audience of professionals and tech enthusiasts. We have lots of lists summing up the best TVs, best laptops, best robots, best headphones, best mobile accessories, and more.\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nAlso: CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nBut we also wanted to give you a list of our absolute top picks from CES that we think will be most worth your hard-earned money when they launch in 2024. And naturally, we also wanted to highlight the best innovations -- products that you may not buy but are worth knowing about because they could influence other products that you may want to bring into your life in the future. So here they are.\nSamsung S95D OLED: Best TV\nTV innovation was everywhere at CES 2024 with transparent TVs, over 100-inch QLEDs, folding TVs, and 8K projectors. But the best TV of the show had a more subtle upgrade that will have a much bigger impact on the quality of the everyday viewing experience. The Samsung S95D OLED TV unveiled a glare-free display that offers the best qualities of anti-reflective screens while maintaining the intense colors and excellent dynamic range that make OLED the top technology for picture quality. We tested the glare-free display with an intense phone camera flash and were amazed at how well it dispersed the light. This means that you can now use this TV in the brightest rooms -- one of the biggest challenges for OLED TVs. I'm confident that will give this the TV with the best picture quality on the market when it launches this spring. It will likely cost around $2,500, until it gets discounted around Black Friday.\nSamsung S95D\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid: Best laptop\nWe've tested and seen plenty of 2-in-1 computers at ZDNET, but there's none quite like Lenovo's new ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid. That's because this is the world's first 2-in-1 Windows PC and Android tablet, meaning as you detach the 14-inch OLED display from the keyboard, the device automatically converts into the Android operating system. On top of that, you can still connect the bottom keyboard portion of the 2-in-1 to an external monitor, giving you, essentially, two computers to work with.\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nTimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub: Best AI device\nIn the past year, we have seen major leaps in the AI space, which led to a boom in translation technology at CES. The TimeKettle X1 made delivers real-time translations in up to 40 languages, with nearly no latency and high accuracy, which I got the chance to experience myself. The device itself fits in the palm of your and includes a screen that displays transcriptions of your conversation and two earbuds that two people can wear for real-time in-ear translations during a one-on-one conversation. There are a series of modes, making it ideal for every situation you may need a translation. If you sync different hubs, it can provide real-time translations for up to 20 people in five different languages, aimed for use in classrooms and meetings. The product is already available for $699 on the TimeKettle website.\nTimeKettle X1 Interpreter Hub\nMSI Claw: Best gaming device\nIn what is becoming one of the hottest product categories in recent years, the Taiwanese computer maker's first gaming handheld impresses with the latest Intel Core Ultra processor for AI enhancements to performance and gaming, a more ergonomic design (with plenty of ventilation) than its competition, and USB-C Thunderbolt support for external monitor use. The LCD display falls short to its OLED rivals, but the gaming potential of this handheld should more than compensate for it. It will start at $699 and arrive later this year.\nMSI Claw\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar: Best tech accessory\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar offers the same types of insights a fitness tracker for humans would. You place the attachment on your dog's collar and on the app you will have access to data about your dog's heart health, activity, appetite, and more. The attachment can also track your dog's location, eliminating the need for additional trackers such as AirTags. One of the most important features is its ability to detect early symptoms of heart disease, potentially saving your dog's life. The Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category since it is through AI that the collar can detect your dog's activities, such as sleeping, walking, and more. The Minitailz Smart Dog Collar is already available for $99, and it requires a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\nMinitailz Smart Dog Collar\nHoloconnect Holobox: Best innovation overall\nThe Holoconnect Holobox makes it possible to talk to someone via a hologram with near-zero latency. It's a \"plug and play\" system, so all you need to do is plug it in and connect it to the internet to get started. To be a hologram yourself, you need a white background that is well-lit, and then you can carry on like it is a regular video call. It is already available for consumer use, and we even saw Google use the Holobox to showcase its Android characters in fun and innovative ways at CES 2024. The price is not disclosed on the Holoconnect website, but interested customers can request a pricing list. It's very expensive and most people aren't going to want to put this phone booth sized box in their living room, but the idea of video calls of the future becoming holograms is super compelling.\nHoloconnect Holobox\nTCL 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV: Best TV innovation\nThe recent trend in Laser TV and ultra short throw (UST) projectors has spawned a wave of interest in 100-inch and 120-inch screens to create a more cinema-like experience at home. At CES, Samsung even unveiled an 8K projector that goes up to 150 inches. The challenge with these projectors is that they're never going to have the same level of dynamic range, brightness, or color intensity as today's best OLED and QLED TVs. TCL had an answer to that at CES with the announcement of its 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV. We were highly impressed with the picture quality of this QLED display in a private demo. It's an extension of TCL's QM8 series, which ZDNET and others have rated as one of the best TVs on the market. The TCL 115QM891G (the official product name) kicks it up a notch with 5,000 nits of brightness and 20,000 local dimming zones to drive excellent dynamic range and sharp colors. Pricing wasn't announced but it will likely cost around $20,000 and it will be available at Best Buy. That makes it an ultra-premium purchase, but if you have the space and the budget then you can now get a projector-level screen size with the benefits of the latest advances in QLED picture quality.\nTCL 115-inch QD-MiniLED TV\nRabbit: Best AI innovation\nWhat if AI assistants could do more than just give you the best search results and leave you to do the rest? What if they could book an Airbnb for you, shop for groceries online and checkout, or start a return for that impulsive Black Friday purchase? That's what the folks at Rabbit are touting with R1, its new $199 pocket device that operates on a \"Large Action Model\". Made in partnership with Teenage Engineering, the R1 may be the first of many AI hardware releases in 2024. The ball is now in the court of the world's biggest tech giants to deliver superior voice assistant experiences to match the capabilities of what Rabbit has come up with.\nRabbit R1\nSony XR headset: Best VR/AR innovation\nSony gave us the biggest shocker of CES 2024 in the opening keynote of the show when it partnered with Siemens to unveil an XR headset with high-end specs and an attractive Sony design. While this headset has the oomph to compete with Apple Vision Pro, it's not aimed at a general consumer audience but is focused directly on professionals, engineers, and designers to help them accelerate product development and create spatial content experiences that could ultimately run on Vision Pro, Meta Quest, and other headsets and smart glasses. This product will have the potential to save a lot of time and resources for companies in flying people around the globe or shipping prototypes to collaborate on and finalize their products. They'll do this by creating \"digital twins\" in virtual spaces such as Siemens NX Immersive Designer. Sony won't sell the headset as a standalone device, but it will be bundled with Siemens' platform and other software packages for specific industries. That will include an entertainment industry bundle that Sony wants to use to empower the next generation of digital storytellers to build immersive 3D experiences.\nSony XR headset\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES 2024 Day 2: The 8 announcements that intrigued us most\nThe best smart home tech at CES 2024"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Some of the most weird and the wonderful tech innovations and gadgets unveiled so far\nFrom hairdryers that use light to dry your hair to the latest air taxi concepts, CES 2024 is brimming with new tech. Here's our pick of the crop.\nThe 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is well underway this week in Las Vegas with an expected 130,000 attendees flowing through its doors.\nAt the annual tech convention, tech companies around the world are boasting their latest technologies - and this year, it ranges from hairdryers to air taxis.\nHere are some of the weird and wonderful gadgets gaining attention at the world's largest tech fair so far.\nL'Oreal's hairdryer that uses infrared light\nL\u2019Oreal has developed a hairdryer that uses a combination of infrared light and air, unlike the traditional thermal rods to dry hair faster.\n\"We've created a whole new way to think about how to use a hairdryer,\" said Guive Balooch, the global managing director of augmented beauty and open innovation at L\u2019Oreal Research.\n\"By having the light, it allows you not only to be able to heat the air more efficiently... It also gets your hair to be 59 per cent visually smoother, so you get more hydrated hair, smoother hair, and less damage,\" added Balooch.\nThe cosmetics company says the AirLight Pro uses up to 31 per cent less energy compared to conventional hairdryers.\nThe handheld device can be controlled using an app when users want to change temperature or styling settings.\nBMW's automated valet car parking\nGerman automaker BMW has invited visitors to try its new concept car BMW iX. One of its new features includes automated valet parking which allows teleoperation.\nThis means a teleoperation driver can park a car without sitting in the vehicle.\nBMW says the underlying tech can be used for both an autonomous driving system and a remote-controlled valet parking system.\nWhen controlled remotely, the concept car can go up to 10 km/h. Cameras on the vehicle send out video images to a teleoperation workplace where the images are displayed.\nThe control commands then are sent back to the vehicle via a wireless network.\n\"There are quite a few use cases\u2026 They [It] could be applied at assembly plants, it could be applied for rental cars, it could be applied for car sharing vehicles. But there are also further other use cases for the end customer. When you can think of being driven while you do your emails or whatever,\" said Thorsten Schmitt from BMW.\nCreating an AI twin for content creators\nA California-based firm Hollo AI\u2019s new app is designed to generate AI twins for people just in minutes.\nThe company hopes that its app will help content creators' time-consuming jobs and help them connect with fans around the world without a language barrier.\n\"We built this as the idea that a creator, a user, could make money while they sleep and interact while they sleep. So their fans can engage and talk to them in 29 different languages,\" said Rex Wong, the CEO of Hollo AI.\nAll you need is your selfies and voice memos, and the app will churn out a \u2018Chat GPT\u2019 with your personality in minutes, says Hallo AI.\n\"Social media is not a 9 to 5 job. It's a 24-hour job. There's no breaks. So I definitely think having Hollo AI, will definitely give me a little bit of a break because now they're not only having me like face-to-face, but they're having me on their phone 24-7,\" said McKenzi Brooke, a Los Angeles-based content creator.\nHyundai showcases its air taxi\nSupernal, Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s air taxi subsidiary, showcased its new aero taxi, S-A2 made for affordable, everyday passenger air travel.\nThe 4-passenger electric vertical takeoff and landing vehicle (eVTOL) is designed to cruise 193 km/h at an altitude of 457 m.\nIt has eight all-tilting rotors and Supernal says the battery-powered aircraft should operate quietly in comparison to traditional helicopters.\n\"The beauty of it is it's all powered by a battery. So, no emission. And because the rotors are smaller, blades are smaller and distributed, so it'll be quieter, Much quieter than the helicopter,\" said Jaiwon Shin, president of Hyundai Motor Group and CEO of Supernal.\nShin says the company will target primarily urban areas because currently the routine commercial operation of aircraft-populated areas has been limited.\n\"It will be supplemental to ground transportation by opening the skies over our cities,\" added Shin.\nThe president of the company says it\u2019s set to enter the market by 2028, by which time, he believes, regulations should be ready for such air travel.\nFoldable OLED displays from Samsung\nSamsung Display says its latest foldable OLED displays are tougher than ever.\nThey have successfully gone through an array of tests - from folding in extreme temperatures to basketballs bouncing on its panels.\n\"What we have been able to achieve is the highest military standards. From temperature shocks like high 60 degrees to -20, acceleration, drop test, as well as icing to make sure that the user is confident that the OLED foldable display that you buy is going to be perfect no matter what the user scenario is,\" said Chirag Shah, Senior Director of Marketing Business Development at Samsung Display.\nThe company says OLED displays are more suitable for vehicle interiors compared to LCD screens because they are less affected by freezing temperatures.\n\"OLED offers a very customised ability and flexibility to customise a display,\" said Shah.\n\"There is a passenger information display. There's a cluster information display. We have side or e-mirrors that are available,\" he added.\nThe annual CES trade fair runs from January 9 to 12 this year.\nFor more on this story, watch the video in the media player above.\nVideo editor \u2022 Roselyne Min\nYou might also like\nCountries with the best and worst Internet speeds in Europe\nThis cake may boost your brain health, experts say\n2 years on, this is what James Webb has taught us about the universe\nTop stories\nMeet the influencers giving career advice on TikTok\nBlack, female patients \u2018less likely\u2019 to be prioritised in emergencies\nFallen crypto company Terraform Labs files for bankruptcy in the US\nMeta lays out its \u2018future roadmap\u2019 for human-like AI\nFirst malaria vaccination programme for children launched in Cameroon\nMost read\nMeet the first Spanish AI model who earns up to \u20ac10,000 per month\nJapan makes history as fifth country to land on the Moon\nEuropean orbiter may have discovered huge water deposits on Mars\nThese AI tools could help boost your academic research\nWhat is 'Disease X' and why should we be taking it seriously?"

Amid the noise, OliverIQ is on a path to supplying a smart home-as-a-service offering for ISPs that can hold it all together.\nJanuary 19, 2024\nLAS VEGAS \u2013 CES 2024 \u2013 Artificial intelligence came off as the major theme at this year's big gadgetfest, as the various show floors around the convention center seemed wall-to-wall with products that featured at least some root elements of AI.\nBut this year's show also amplified the fact that (almost) everything is now connected \u2013 or wants to be connected. And this onslaught of IoT naturally flows into the smart home and its evolving network of connected doorbells, cameras, lights and thermostats. A big challenge there is managing all of those disparate devices, enabling them to work together under a unified system, and knowing what to do when one link in the chain is broken.\nA company that appears to be on the cusp of solving this issue is OliverIQ, which debuted its smart home-as-a-service approach at CES 2024. We covered some of the high points in this story, but learned a few more details about the company's plans during a visit with Glen Mella, OliverIQ's chief revenue officer.\nOliverIQ demonstrated its new smart home-as-a-service platform at CES 2024.\nIn addition to targeting its subscription-based platform at cable operators and other broadband service providers, OliverIQ is also exploring partnerships with security companies, consumer electronics retailers and home builders.\nThe company is making some progress. Mella said OliverIQ expects to announce agreements later this year with partners that serve \"hundreds of thousands of homes,\" and is in talks with some that serve \"millions\" of them.\nElsewhere, a pilot is being planned with a major retailer across four markets and about 16 stores, he said.\nHitting on categories such as video streaming, mobility and smart TVs, here's a roundup of our other coverage from CES 2024:\nNuvyyo sizes up ATSC 3.0 for new Tablo device, explores potential cable tie-ups\nPhilo revs up its FAST strategy as subs exceed 1M\nPeter Adderton on MobileX's path to disruption\nCox Mobile looks to 'ramp volume' in 2024\nTiVo advances on smart TVs, streaming options for broadband partners\nROXi's TV-centric music video streaming service enters US, tunes in ATSC 3.0\nOliverIQ pitches smart home-as-a-service to broadband service providers\nWi-Fi 7 ready to hit the big time, org claims\nCable's '10G' journey makes progress\u2026 with a few bumps along the way\nAI, flying cars on tap for CES 2024\nAbout the Author(s)\nJeff Baumgartner\nSenior Editor, Light Reading\nJeff Baumgartner is a Senior Editor for Light Reading and is responsible for the day-to-day news coverage and analysis of the cable and video sectors.
