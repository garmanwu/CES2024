        "raw_content": "GEEKOM Mini IT13 Review: Core i9-13900H in a 4x4 Package\nThe performance of ultra-compact form-factor (UCFF) desktops has improved significantly since the introduction of the Intel NUC in the early 2010s. In addition to advancements in semiconductor fabrication and processor architecture, thermal solutions suitable for these 4in. x 4in. machines have also been evolving simultaneously. As a result, vendors have been able to configure higher sustained power limits for the processors in these systems. From the 17W TDP processor used in the first-generation 4x4 NUC, the form-factor moved on to 28W in the late 2010s. The processors in the latest flagship 4x4 NUCs are configured with a 40W sustained power limit.\nIntel and AMD have been officially allowing configurable TDPs for their notebook segment offerings for a few years now. This has prompted some vendors to introduce UCFF systems with regular 45W TDP processors (albeit, in cTDP-down mode). GEEKOM became one of the first vendors to release a Core i9-based UCFF machines with the launch of the Mini IT13. Based on paper specifications, this high-end Raptor Lake-H (RPL-H) UCFF desktop is meant to give the mainstream RPL-P NUCs stiff competition in both performance and price.\nGEEKOM sent over the flagship configuration - a Mini IT13 equipped with a Core i9-13900H, a 2TB SSD and 32GB of DRAM - to put through our evaluation routine for small form-factor computing systems. This review explores the performance profile and value proposition of the system, along with analysis of the tradeoffs involved in cramming a 45W TDP processor into a 4x4 machine.\nIntroduction and Product Impressions\nThe days of bulky desktops are getting numbered for many use-cases, with small form-factor (SFF) systems replacing them. The rapid growth in this segment has led to the rise of many Asian vendors focusing on these systems. GEEKOM is a private label brand of Shenzhen Jiteng Network Technology Co., Ltd. - an OEM / ODM for small form-factor computing systems. The company manufactures both Intel and AMD-based systems. The private label started off with a few entry-level systems (such as the MiniAir 11) , but has since branched out to introduce machines with leading-edge processors. The company had announced the Raptor Lake-H-based Mini IT13 within a few days of the launch of the SimplyNUC Onyx. While the Onyx is still in the pre-order stage, GEEKOM has been selling the Mini IT13 for a few weeks now.\nGEEKOM sent over the flagship Mini IT13 configuration for review. The Intel Core i8-13900H processor in the Mini IT13 review system has a six performance cores and eight efficiency cores for a total of 20 threads. Compared to the RPL-P processors used in the flagship mainstream 4x4 NUCs, this RPL-H processor has two extra performance cores and a higher maximum turbo frequency (up to 5.4 GHz, against RPL-P's maximum 5.0 GHz). The processor is fabricated in the Intel 7 process.\nGEEKOM's package for the Mini IT13 is spartan - the main unit is accompanied by a welcome card, VESA mount with associated screws, an installation guide, HDMI cable, and a 120W (19V @ 6.32A) AC adapter with a geo-specific power cord.\nThe main unit clocks in at 117mm x 112mm x 49.2mm, with a weight of 652g. The system is sized to accept a 2.5\" drive, and that makes it comparable to the full-height mainstream NUCs such as the NUC13ANHi7 Arena Canyon SKU measuring 117mm x 112mm x 54mm. The larger dimensions allow for a wider variety of ports in the systems compared to regular NUCs.\nGEEKOM does not sell barebones versions of the Mini IT13. A SSD, DRAM, and a pre-installed copy of Windows 11 Pro are also provided. In keeping with the premium nature of the Core i8-13900H, the configuration with that CPU includes a 2TB SSD and 32GB of RAM.\nUnlike the GEEKOM AS6, the board and chassis design are fairly straightforward and similar to the NUCs.\nThe DDR4 SODIMM slots and the Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD slots on the motherboard are pre-populated in the GEEKOM configurations. The WLAN / BT module interfaces with the CPU over CNVi and is under the NVMe SSD slot (similar to the mainstream NUCs). There is a metal frame that is built around the 2.5\" drive slot, and a thermal pad is affixed to it to provide heat transfer support from the M.2 2280 NVMe SSD. Our review configuration was equipped with 2x Lexar LD4AS016G-3200ST DDR4-3200 SODIMMs and a Lexar SSD NM7A1 Gen4 x4 M.2 2280 NVMe SSD. Windows 11 Professional came pre-installed.\nThe full specifications of the review sample (as tested) are summarized in the table below. The Core i9-13900H has a TDP of 45W, and a minimum power (cTDP-down) of 35W. As we shall see in our BIOS options analysis and detailed investigation into the thermal characteristics in a later section, the form-factor of the system and the notebook-style thermal solution restricts the operation of the processor in a 35W cTDP mode.\nThe next section details the the various BIOS options and follows it up with a detailed platform analysis.\nPost Your Comment\n9 Comments\nView All Comments\nPIPELINE STORIES\nLINKS\nTOPICS\nFOLLOW\nLog in\nDon't have an account?

        "raw_content": "GEEKOM AS 6 (ASUS PN53) Review: Ryzen 9 6900HX Packs Punches in a Petite Package\nThe market demand for small form-factor (SFF) PCs was kickstarted by the Intel NUC in the early 2010s. Since then, many vendors have come out with their own take on the Intel NUC using both Intel and AMD processors. In recent years, we have also seen various Asian companies such as Beelink, Chuwi, GEEKOM, GMKtec, MinisForum, etc. emerging with a focus solely on these types of computing systems. We had looked at GEEKOM's Jasper Lake offering - the MiniAir 11 - last year, and came away satisfied with the build quality of the device.\nEarlier this year, GEEKOM announced a tie-up with ASUS to market specific configurations of the ASUS ExpertCenter PN53 under their own brand as the GEEKOM AS 6. Based on AMD's Rembrandt line of notebook processors, the GEEKOM AS 6 comes with a choice of the Ryzen 9 6900HX, Ryzen 7 6800H, or the Ryzen 7 7735H.\nThe CPU choices all belong to the Rembrandt family of SoCs utilizing CPU cores with the Zen 3+ microarchitecture. While the Ryzen 9 6800HX and the Ryzen 7 6800H were released in early 2022, the Ryzen 7 7735H was launched as a China-only SKU earlier this year along with a few other 'Rembrandt Refresh' SoCs. We have already taken a detailed look at the ASRock Industrial 4X4 BOX-7735U based on one such refresh SKU - the Ryzen 7 7735U.\nThe initial wave of systems based on Rembrandt SoCs impressed with their performance, but the connectivity aspects did not measure up to the possibilities enabled by Thunderbolt in the Intel ecosystem. Over the last few quarters, that has perceptibly changed with the USB4 capabilities of the SoCs (including PCIe tunneling support) getting reflected in the newer set of Rembrandt systems. Most mid-range and high-end systems based on Rembrandt now come with full-featured USB4 ports, and the GEEKOM AS 6 is no exception. The company sent across their flagship configuration - the AS 6 equipped with a Ryzen 9 6900HX, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and a 1TB Gen4 x4 NVMe SSD - to put through our evaluation routine for small form-factor computing systems. This review explores the performance profile and value proposition of the GEEKOM AS 6.\nIntroduction and Product Impressions\nSmall form-factor (SFF) systems have been replacing bulky desktops for many use-cases in recent years. The rapid growth in this segment has created a number of companies (mainly based out of Asia) focusing on these systems. GEEKOM is a private label brand of Shenzhen Jiteng Network Technology Co., Ltd. - an OEM / ODM for small form-factor computing systems. The company manufactures both Intel and AMD-based systems. For the latter, the company has a tie-up with ASUS. The GEEKOM AS 5 (using AMD Cezanne SoCs) introduced last year was a rebranded version of the ASUS ExpertCenter PN52. The GEEKOM AS 6 we are looking at in this review is a rebrand of the ASUS ExpertCenter PN53, and uses high-end Rembrandt SoCs. The Ryzen 9 6900HX processor in the AS 6 review system has a 8C / 16T (Zen 3+) configuration fabricated in TSMC's 6nm process. In addition to the minor improvements in CPU performance over the Zen 3 / Cezanne family, the integrated GPU has also migrated from the Vega-based ones in previous generations to the RDNA2-based Radeon 680M.\nGEEKOM's package components for the AS 6 differs from the ASUS PN53's. We have seen in previous ASUS mini-PC reviews that a wired keyboard and mouse are always bundled in the retail kit. GEEKOM opts to keep things simple and compact by shipping the main system, a VESA mount, a few screws for the SATA and M.2 drives, and a 150W power adapter (20V @ 7.5A) along with a quick-start guide.\nThe company also keeps the ASUS branding in the front panel, and the system supports all of the software value additions available for the ASUS PN53. On the hardware front, the system clocks in at 120mm x 130mm x 58mm (compared to a full-height mainstream NUC at 117mm x 112mm x 54mm). The larger dimensions allow for a wider variety of ports in the system. Unlike the mainstream Intel NUCs that adopt a single PCB layout, the GEEKOM AS 6 adopts a motherboard / daughterboard strategy with a flexible printed circuit (FPC) connector, as shown below.\nThe daughterboard includes a Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD slot as well as the SATA connector and the non Type-C display outputs. The DDR5 SODIMM slots and one of the Gen4 x4 M.2 SSD slots on the main board are pre-populated in the GEEKOM configurations. The WLAN / BT module is under the primary NVMe SSD slot (similar to the mainstream Intel NUCs). The metal frame, coupled with the thermal pads for both Gen4 M.2 slots point to some thought being put in to keep the SSD temperatures under check. There is also a 2.5\" SATA drive slot in the system. However, with no direct active airflow on that side of the board, it may not be ideal to install one in addition to the M.2 SSDs. The external I/O includes five display outputs (including the two USB4 Type-C ports), but only four of them can be active at a time.\nThe GEEKOM AS 6 review configuration was equipped with 2x Crucial CT16G48C40S5.M8A1 DDR5-4800 SODIMMs and a Kingston NV2 PCIe Gen4 x4 M.2 2280 NVMe SSD. Windows 11 Professional came pre-installed.\nThe full specifications of the review sample (as tested) are summarized in the table below. The Ryzen 9 6900HX has a configurable TDP (cTDP) ranging from 35W to 54W. As we shall see in our detailed investigation into the thermal characteristics in a later section, the form-factor of the system and the notebook-style thermal solution restricts the operation of the SoC in a 35W cTDP mode.\nThe next section details the the various BIOS options and follows it up with a detailed platform analysis.\nPost Your Comment\n14 Comments\nView All Comments\nPIPELINE STORIES\nLINKS\nTOPICS\nFOLLOW\nLog in\nDon't have an account?
