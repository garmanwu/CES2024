Visitors can explore this cutting-edge innovation, along with upcoming releases and the complete product lineup, at the Dangbei exhibition at Booth 50965 in Halls A-D, Venetian Expo.\nThinner. Brighter. Smarter - Dangbei Atom\nAs Dangbei's first Google TV\u2122 laser projector with built-in Netflix, the Dangbei Atom stands out as one of the industry's first smart projectors to further upgrade the content ecosystem. Leveraging Google TV's content-first UI, it integrates diverse app content and personalized recommendations, streamlining the search for preferred shows. Google TV's features, including Watchlist, Multiple Profiles, Google Assistant, and Chromecast built-in, enhance the overall family entertainment experience, making the Atom's big screen entertainment more accessible, intelligent, and user-friendly.\nWith a brightness figure of up to 1200 ISO Lumens, the Dangbei Atom could well be the brightest projector on the market compared with other low form factor home cinema projectors. It deviates from the conventional expectation of high-brightness laser projectors typically being bulky in design. The Atom features ALPD laser technology for a bright, speckle- and color fringe-free 1080p image that reduces visual fatigue. In a compact 1.87-inch thick, 2.82 pound design, it effortlessly delivers a 180-inch big screen viewing experience in many locations at home.\nDangbei Atom improves color performance and intelligent image adjustment, offering users enhanced customization with three color temperature presets and RGB gain adjustments. Smart features like autofocus, auto keystone correction, and intelligent screen fit have been enhanced for faster and more accurate performance.\nThe Dangbei Atom will be available for pre-order in January on the\u00a0Dangbei official website for $899.99. To celebrate the launch, Dangbei will offer a $150 discount coupon.\u00a0Consumers can also purchase the product on Amazon after it is officially launched.\nNext Dimension in 4K Laser Home Cinema - Dangbei Mars Pro 2 & X5 Ultra\nAlong with the Dangbei Atom, visitors can also experience two upcoming 4K laser projectors set to debut in the international market. These include its first 4K laser projector with HDR10+ - the Dangbei Mars Pro 2, scheduled for release in the first half of 2024. It boasts a brightness of 2450 ISO lumens and dual 12W super powerful speakers supporting DTS:X.\nAnother innovation is\u00a0the first 4K projector with triple-color laser and full-color LED hybrid light sources. Visitors will be able to get a first-hand experience of its current Chinese version, the Dangbei X5 Ultra. Utilizing ALPD 5.0 laser technology, it achieves enhanced brightness and color improvements, covering 110% of the BT.2020 wide color gamut.\n4K Pad on the Go - Dangbei PadGO\nAside from projectors, Dangbei will unveil its future product line featuring the Dangbei PadGO, a 4K 27-inch movable large tablet. With a rollable stand, rotatable, and height-adjustable screen, it is suitable for watching dramas, listening to music, gaming, and working out in every room at home.\nDangbei aims to foster deep connections with partners, consumers, and other participants. Visit the Dangbei booth at CES 2024 to glimpse the future of home entertainment.\nLocation: Booth 50965, Halls A-D Venetian Expo\nDate: January 9-12, 2024\nDangbei will also attend the Pepcom event on January 8th in Las Vegas. Join us at the Mirage hotel from 7:00 pm -10:30 pm.\nAbout Dangbei\nAs a premium provider of smart large-screen services, Dangbei specializes in designing and developing software matrix, operating systems, smart projectors and more.

        "raw_content": "Equinix Expands in Ashburn, Plans Fleet of Four-Story Data Centers\nAshburn, Virginia is where it all started for Equinix. More than 20 years after its very first data center helped create \u201cData Center Alley,\u201d Equinix is kicking off its next phase of growth in Ashburn with a new campus, which will soon feature a fleet of four-story data centers.\nToday Equinix opened the doors on DC21, the first building on a property just down the road from the original Equinix campus that anchors the world\u2019s busiest Internet intersection. The $95 million first phase will feature 41,000 square feet of colocation space, along with a Co-Innovation Facility (CIF) where Equinix will work with customers to develop new approaches to data center power and cooling.\n\u201cThe Ashburn market is continuing to grow by leaps and bounds,\u201d said Jon Lin, the President, Americas for Equinix. \u201cIt has become the hub for all digital infrastructure. It\u2019s the ideal location to tap into innovation and roll out new features.\u201d\nAlthough DC21 is just two stories, future buildings on the new campus will be four stories tall to boost the volume of racks and servers that Equinix can host in the buildings, according to Lin.\n\u201cOur planning sees us going more vertical,\u201d said Lin, who said future Equinix buildings in Ashburn will use a four-story design it developed for its DA11 data center at the Dallas Infomart.\nEquinix is the first company to announce plans for a four-story data center in Loudoun County, where most developers are building two-story projects, and the tallest data center is a three-story facility opened by QTS Data Centers in 2018.\n$200 Million in 2020 Investment in Ashburn\nNorthern Virginia is home to more than 100 data centers and more than 10 million square feet of data center space. As the cloud grows, having servers in the region has become the table stakes for companies with ambitions in cloud computing. The area is unique in its connectivity, and that\u2019s largely due to the success of Equinix, which specializes in making the physical connections that enable traffic to flow between networks and across the Internet.\nEquinix built its very first data center in Ashburn in 1999, bringing together a critical mass of carriers and Internet on-ramps. The company has grown into a data center colossus, leasing space to 9,500 customers in 225 data centers across 63 cities around the world.\nThat now includes 16 data centers in Northern Virginia, housing more than 200 networks and providing on-ramps to major cloud platforms. DC21 is the first building on its new campus at the intersection of Loudoun County Parkway and Waxpool Road. Equinix bought the 34.5-acre site in 2017 for $1 million an acre, a deal that kicked off a sharp rise in land values in Data Center Alley.\nEquinix says it can deploy 925 cabinets of customer equipment in the first phase. When the building is complete, it will provide total capacity of 3,100 cabinet equivalents and colocation space of more than 124,000 square feet. DC21 arrives barely six months after the opening of the $111 million first phase of Equinix DC15, boosting the company\u2019s 2020 investment in Ashburn to more than $200 million.\nTesting Innovations in Data Center Design\nEquinix says the Ashburn expansion provides additional capacity to meet demand from the enterprise, government, cloud and financial services sectors. As these customers adopt new technologies, DC21 will serve as a testbed for how data center design will evolve.\nEquinix has always worked with IT vendors to help test how new equipment will operate in a multi-tenant environment. Much of that research has focused on IT equipment like servers and switches.\n\u201cThe new wrinkle is our ability to test solutions for the data center itself, like liquid cooling designs, containment and extreme density solutions,\u201d said Lin, who noted that new deployments of hardware optimized for AI is creating demand for \u201cspot cooling\u201d to manage high-density zones within a multi-tenant environment. To add more flexibility to its cooling infrastructure, Lin said Equinix has recently switched from using indirect evaporative cooling to a design using chilled water.\nAnother area where the Co-Innovation Facility may be useful is in testing new approaches to the power chain. Lin said that the data center industry is considering the impact of new approaches to power infrastructure in the wake of Microsoft\u2019s announcement that it plans to phase out diesel generators by 2030.\nAshburn is also one of four markets offering Equinix Metal, which\u00a0aims to bring cloud-style automation to physical infrastructure, enabling dedicated servers to be provisioned \u201cas a service.\u201d\u00a0 It builds upon the bare metal server offering from Packet, which Equinix\u00a0acquired earlier this year, and comes integrated with virtual networking technology to quickly connect users with essential clouds and services.\nTaller Data Centers Are the Future\nEquinix has not disclosed a specific timeline for when it will begin building four-story buildings in Ashburn, but Lin said that will be its standard design for the new campus, which has enough land to support at least three more data center buildings.\nThe move to taller buildings is a trend we first noted in 2017, as leading developers turned to vertical data center designs to boost their capacity to house IT gear.\u00a0 It\u2019s a new direction for data center construction, which for many years focused on sturdy, single-story cement fortresses.\nThat was true for many years in Loudoun County, but as land for data center development becomes scarce, more projects are adopting multi-story designs that seek to make the most of real estate.\nThe four-story design is included in site plans filed with planning officials in Loudoun County, which has encouraged the use of multi-story data centers to support smarter growth for the sector. County revenue from taxes on computer equipment inside buildings in Data Center Alley will account for $395 million in the current fiscal year, helping cushion the county from the bruising impact of tax shortfalls related to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRich Miller\nContinue Reading\nBetter Data Center Development through Master Planning\nThe Eight Themes That Will Shape the Data Center Industry in 2024\nSponsored Recommendations\nWhat to Consider for Underground Duct Bank Runs\nData Center's Lightning-Fast Conduit Installation\nElectrical Conduit Elbow eGuide\nXpress Elbows Guide for Industrial Construction\nVoices of the Industry\nWhat is Hyperscale?\nLatest in Interconnection\nDF&I CEO Sheds Light On Dark Fiber Expansion In Top U.S. Data Center Markets\nHigh-Speed DACs: A Viable Option for Next Generation 5G Open RAN and Open Edge Connections\nThe Partners That Modernize Interconnectivity for Cloud and Data Center Solutions\nWhite Papers\nSustainable Power Generation: Kohler\u2019s Pursuit of Clean Energy Solutions\nSponsored\nConsiderations for Direct Burial Conduit\nElectrical Conduit Buyer's Guide\nExplore EcoCare Membership Digital Experience"

        "raw_content": "Why is Ashburn the Data Center Capital of the World?\nAshburn, a city in Virginia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Loudoun County about 34 miles from Washington D.C., is widely known as the Data Center Capital of the World. Loudoun County has similar renown and is called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The Center of the Internet\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Data Center Alley.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Online data isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t stored in a \u00e2\u20ac\u0153cloud,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd of course. A physical location is required for the networked computer servers in a data center. The Internet became available to the public in 1991, and by the late 1990s, Ashburn and its surrounding region of Northern Virginia was identified as an ideal location for data centers and storage of massive amounts of data. That particular spot on the map is where an estimated 70 percent of the planet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Internet traffic flows each and every day.\nGrasping the Scope of Ashburn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Data Center Market\nThe data center market in and around Ashburn, in Northern Virginia, became, not long ago, the first in the world to surpass 1 gigawatt of overall data center capacity. London is a distant second, with only about half the capacity, at 559 megawatts (MWs) of inventory.\nData Center Alley shows no signs of slowing down, with 557 MW of data center storage either under construction or in the planning stages. No other markets across the seven continents approach the rate at which the Ashburn area is increasing in new data storage projects. This begs the questions: Why is Ashburn the site of such data storage dominance?\nWhy Ashburn?\nSeveral purely practical factors considered together pinpointed Ashburn as the ideal place for Internet and fiber network expansion.\nCost of Land in Ashburn\nFirst, the land was available at reasonable prices. It was practically all rural back then. But now? Due to the favorability of the region for data center development, acres are currently being sold like hotcakes for $1 million or more.\nCost of Electricity\nIn Ashburn, the cost of electricity is 20% lower than the natural average. This is significant because keeping servers cool is the greatest expense related to data centers, and the cost is tremendous. Almost 40% of the electricity required to keep the lights on in the United Kingdom is the amount used to provide electricity to data centers across the world. Another way to put it is that 3% of the total electricity used in the world recently went for data centers. The amount of electricity required just to power the growing number of centers increases exponentially each year.\nBy the late 1990s, this section of North Virginia was viewed as the perfect place for the expansion of the internet and fiber networks. The land was reasonably priced, the electricity cost was low, and it was near a skilled and educated population. The region is simply ripe for business. Loudon County is the number one county in America for personal income, with an average household income reaching beyond six figures to $125,900, according to Census Bureau information. With an unemployment rate of 3.3 percent, and a sales tax exemption for data center customers that goes through 2035, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s easy to see why the area is attracting the bigwigs of colocation.\nNOVA is perfect for cloud computing because its local economy is already stable from previous development projects, making major utility price hikes unlikely in the near future. Large sources of cheap power are available, and local construction companies have been tackling data center projects for nearly thirty years, making them as close to experts in the field as you\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re going to find. Northern Virginia boasts a technically skilled workforce. The huge presence of government technology contracting companies has also contributed to this pool of talented workers. Data center operators are continuing their buildouts at a rapid pace. Increasing investments in building new and upgrading existing data centers that support the provision of cloud services is among the main drivers of growth.\nThe final element making Northern Virginia attractive for data centers is its power. Dominion Energy is the main power utility provider to the region. It provides about 1 Gigawatt of reliable, low cost energy throughout North Virginia. This availability of stable power in combination with the fiber infrastructure and government support is essential to the ever-expanding data center space. In addition to that, its electricity rate 20% below the national average made it the perfect place to develop technology and hosting infrastructure.\nImprove\nThis part of Northern Virginia (NOVA) was perfect for the first expansion of Internet and fiber investments during the early 1990s. The land \u00e2\u20ac\u201c still almost all rural back then \u00e2\u20ac\u201c was reasonably priced and close to the nation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s capital, making it a prime location for the development of what is now called the Dulles Technology Corridor, sometimes referred to as the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Silicon Valley of the East.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nWhen they created their campus of data centers, it formed the foundation for interconnectivity with massive potential. Each new connection contributed to the wider ecosystem, creating a compounding effect. Other companies such as Digital Realty and Dupont Fabros (now owned by Digital Realty) began to build outward from the campus to benefit from the powerful digital ecosystem. The demand for space in the Data Center Alley began to rise as more organizations realized the value of tapping into such a highly interconnected infrastructure leading to the development of more facilities. The region evolved at such a phenomenal rate that, by 1997, half of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s traffic was already flowing through it.\nAshburn Traffic\nEvery major player in the industry is represented in Loudoun, from Amazon Web Services (NASDAQ: AMZN), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) to CyrusOne (NASDAQ: CONE), Digital Realty Trust (NYSE: DLR) and Equinix (NASDAQ: EQIX).\nAccording to Data Center Frontier, NOVA is host to four of the top 10 cloud campuses in the US. These are data centers featuring raised-floor environments. No other market in the world has more than one of the Top 10. AOL made its home there, followed by Verizon, Telos, Orbital Sciences, and Paxfire. Then came the mega-giants, Amazon and Google and Facebook; the companies that have turned data from a science into an art.\nIn about two decades, the industry evolved from a retail colocation market to the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s data center capital. Everything from wholesale data suites to custom built cloud facilities are available in Ashburn. Today, technology powerhouses like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Oracle and Amazon all have stakes in the Data Center Alley to support their rapidly growing cloud computing needs.\nLoudoun county alone hosts more than 60 data centers which service around 3000 tech companies. Today, up to 70 percent of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s internet traffic flows through these centers daily. important.\nLoudoun County 2018\n-- Now called \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Data Center Alley,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Loudoun County is the subject of one of Internet\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most extreme statistics. According to Loudoun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Department of Economic Development, as much as 70% of all Internet traffic in the world is routed through the county on a daily basis. That sort of number is difficult to quantify. As of June 2018, there were about 4 billion Internet users in the world, about 52% of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s population. There\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s no way to really tell how much worldwide Internet traffic there is in a single second, let alone an entire day. Cisco places the number at around 700 terabytes per second (Tbps). Considering there are 86,400 seconds in a day, and the sheer amount of data flowing daily through Loudon County is truly mind-boggling.\nThe Local Government, Tax Cuts, and Incentives\nThis level of infrastructure development is also supported by the local government. The data center industry is recognized as a vital component of the modern economy, as it impacts every other major industry. Locally, it is a large contributor to employment and a major source of revenue for the state. In fact, Loudoun county has the highest median household income in the US, with nearby Fairfax county trailing closely behind.\nThe Virginia state government was able to recognize this potential and played a major role in the development of Data Center Alley. In 2014, the Data Center Zoning Ordinance was approved to allow the construction of new data centers in more districts and as long as they adhere to the design guidelines. With high demand for strategic positions on the map, multi-story data facilities are encouraged to maximize space. Loudoun county also began offering the Fast-Track Commercial Incentive Program. The initiative provides a dedicated project manager and gives data center projects priority on the development review list. It also facilitates tax exemptions for data centers that meet their criteria.\nLooking Ahead\nAccording to Buddy Rizer, the Executive Director for Economic Development in Loudoun County, there has not been a single day without construction on a new data facility since 2008. Loudon County continues to benefit marvelously from its position, raking in $110 million in annual tax revenue thanks to its large-scale business partners. With scalability a snap and plenty of land still available, the future continues to look bright for NOVA when it comes its reign as the data capital of the world.\nOver the last dozen years, Rizer said, the commercial portion of Loudoun\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tax base has grown from 19 percent to 34 percent, largely due to data center growth. The real estate tax rate is down 20 cents per $100 of assessed value over the past six years, he said, and the county expects to receive about $250 million this year alone from data center-related taxes.\nNorthern Virginia is where the first commercial exchange was born called MAE-East (Metropolitan Area Exchange) by Metropolitan Fiber Systems (MFS) in Tysons Corner in 1992. Since then, several connectivity-centric companies have made a mark in the Northern Virginia landscape including UUNET, PSINet, AOL and Equinix, to name a few. Terrestrial fiber construction has continued perpetually; you constantly see fiber splice trucks, and road being dug up wherein new conduit systems and terrestrial fiber optic cables are being installed underneath the roads. We have seen the installation of 3,456 strand fiber cable installed in the Northern Virginia region. The region boasts some of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most fiber dense roads as depicted in this image courtesy of NEFiber.\nSubsea fiber cables from Europe and South America land in Virginia Beach and much of the internet traffic is then routed through Loudoun County's \"Data Center Alley.\" Several experts at Bisnow's Data Center Investment Conference & Expo Wednesday said they foresee the cables pulling the data center market south.\nBlog Image 3Until recently, in order for the international Internet traffic to leave the state of Virginia and reach its destination in other parts of the world, it had to be first sent to New York, New Jersey or Florida. This is because the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153landing stations\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd where the subsea fiber systems terminate existed only in these three states in the Eastern Seaboard. This changed in 2017 as Virginia got its first subsea cable, MAREA, connecting Bilbao, Spain to Virginia Beach. The second subsea cable coming to Virginia, BRUSA, is expected to be completed later this year connecting the state of Virginia directly to San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Fortaleza and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The direct international connections will further give the data center community in Virginia more connectivity options for low-latency fast connection to various international destinations. There are also several other subsea fiber projects under consideration for Virginia Beach.\nIn summary, Ashburn has attracted data center and connectivity providers from all over the country. Every major data center provider (retail or wholesale), every major cloud provider, every major terrestrial fiber connectivity provider is in Northern Virginia, and now subsea fiber operators are coming to the state of Virginia.\nTrends\nRegional Data Center Trends to Watch\nBeyond regional trends in supply and demand, there are two specific trends surfacing in Ashburn, specifically. First, developers are building taller data centers to maximize the sellable space on each acre of land, and they are also buying offices or industrial properties and then demolishing existing structures to make way for data centers. These trends will work to influence the development and evolution of Data Center Alley in coming years. Those watching growth in the region will also have noticed developers are looking beyond Ashburn to Loudoun and Prince William counties.\nAs the largest data center market in the country, many of the trends that have gone on to shape the entire business originally stemmed from Northern Virginia. One emerging trend to watch is the widening gap between hyperscale and enterprise requirements, and whether this market segmentation prompts providers to focus on one of these niches or compete across all sectors.\nAs for trends in demand, Northern Virginia continues to be the \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Home of the Hyperscalers\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, touting the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest concentration of cloud computing infrastructure. As cloud providers compete for clients and capacity, data centers will be the front line. As a result, the leading cloud computing players are working to amass capacity for the clouds of the future, which is ramping up demand in Northern Virginia and resulting in giant deals for data center space under development. Amazon Web Services, Facebook and Microsoft have always been focused on the region, but it is now also becoming a goal for expansion for companies like Google, Oracle, Salesforce and Chinese cloud providers, as well as data-driven companies like Uber, LinkedIn, Box and Dropbox.\nNorthern Virginia data center market\nThis strong demand has largely redefined the scale of data center leasing, which is surging past previous records. Prior to 2016, it was unusual to see a wholesale data center lease exceeding 10MW of capacity. This year, the 72MW deal by CloudHQ made the new high in the market. Also illustrating the leasing boom, in just 90 days \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the second quarter of 2018 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d the Northern Virginia data center market saw more leasing than it saw in 2016 (113MW) or 2017 (115MW).\nhttps://datacenterfrontier.com/northern-virginia-data-center-market-record-leasing/\nhttps://www.datacenterknowledge.com/amazon/why-northern-virginia-data-center-market-bigger-most-realize\nhttps://wamu.org/story/18/05/30/how-northern-virginia-became-the-data-center-capital-of-the-u-s/\nhttps://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/12/15/why-energy-is-a-big-and-rapidly-growing-problem-for-data-centers/#5db14715a307\nAuthor\nDatacenters.com Technology\nDatacenters.com is the fastest and easiest way for businesses to find and compare solutions from the world's leading providers of\u00a0Cloud, Bare Metal, and\u00a0Colocation.
