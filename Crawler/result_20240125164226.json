        "raw_content": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems Engineering, Policy, and Design\nFrom the CES24 Floor: ANELLO\u2019s 3-Axis Optical Gyroscope IMU\nThroughout CES 2024, 4,300+ exhibitors and 135,000+ attendees from the global tech industry came together for major announcements, product launches and the opportunity to collaborate on and be inspired by the tech creating a better tomorrow. Among those products, the just-launched ANELLO X3, a small but mighty inertial measurement unit (IMU) from ANELLO Photonics, stood tall as a game-changer for a wide range of multi-domain robotics and autonomous systems markets. Here\u2019s why.\nThe Problem to be Solved\nA picture paints 1,000 words. Just one look at a publicly available map that shows potential navigation system interference based on aircraft ADS-B Exchange data shows the ubiquitous nature of GPS jamming globally.\nNot surprisingly, much of the Middle East, especially the eastern Mediterranean, Gaza, Iraq, Lebanon, Cyprus, Turkey and Armenia, all regularly see GPS jamming activity. Libya in North Africa remains a hot spot. Data from Europe indicates routine jamming around Russia, Ukraine, Poland, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Kaliningrad and Finland. India has its own trouble spots.\nMilitary conflict across or near all these areas appear to be the common thread. GPS signal-interference constitutes a form of electronic warfare (EW). It negatively impacts a wide range of critical navigation-related functions, from targeting to basic command and control (C2). This form of EW frequently spills over into civil society, impacting basic everyday functions that rely on positioning navigation and timing (PNT), from driving maps and commercial flights to precision agriculture.\nThe pervasiveness of this threat has recently sparked efforts in both the United States and Europe to seek complementary PNT (CPNT) technologies and alternative PNT tech (A-PNT), respectively.\nWhile that search remains ongoing, ANELLO has put forth a cost-effective, high-performance navigation sensor that aims to redefine navigation and positioning in contested environments. The company\u2019s latest release is a 3-axis Silicon Photonics Optical Gyroscope (SiPhOG\u2122).\nThrough the FOG of War\nFiber optic gyroscopes (FOGs) measure angular velocity and orientation, enabling autonomous systems without having to rely on global navigation and satellite systems (GNSS), such as the Global Positioning System (GPS).\nFOGs sense rotation by measuring the interference of laser light traveling within a coil of optical fiber based on the \u201cSagnac effect\u201d (a measurement principle based on the movement of an electromagnetic wave in a closed path around a finite area affected by the rotation rate of a given system).\nOptical gyroscopes have no mechanical moving parts. This allows them to remain resistant to vibration, which translates into measurement reliability. This characteristic also means FOGs don\u2019t require maintenance. It also makes them long-lasting.\nFor these reasons, aircraft, spacecraft, surface and subsurface ships and other autonomous vehicles have employed these accurate, precise rotation sensors in their navigation and guidance systems. In fact, they have become particularly invaluable in strategic and tactical grade long-term navigation in GNSS-denied environments.\nBut many of these high-precision FOGs, especially the large ones used in aviation and by the military, can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Some of the systems in helicopters and planes cost upwards of $100,000 apiece.\nThe true advancement in FOGS, and a huge value-add as autonomous systems become smaller and more agile, is in low size-weight-power and cost (SWAP-C). And that\u2019s where Santa Clara-based ANELLO has put its focus.\nSmall But Mighty\nIn 2023, ANELLO introduced its single-axis SiPhOG\u2122. At the time, the tech was the first SWAP-C optical gyro. This next-gen inertial nav sensor uses an on-chip waveguide manufacturing process, integrated with a patented silicon photonic integrated circuit.\nThe company\u2019s processing approach integrates two chips (waveguides using silicon nitride and an integrated silicon photonics chip with couplers, splitters, phase modulators, detectors etc.). This enables high volume production because the units can be produced at the same fabs as integrated circuits. The company partners with Tower Semiconductor to manufacture its IMUs. Their process results in both a low cost and size (about an inch) previously thought impossible.\nThis year, the company upped its game by releasing a 3-axis optical gyro IMU, the ANELLO X3. This complete IMU can fit in the palm of your hand. It takes ANELLO\u2019s tech higher and deeper, literally, by enabling navigation for \u201cthings that move in 3D space,\u201d company co-founder and CEO Mario Paniccia said. The unit\u2019s small SWAP-C makes it well suited for autonomous drones and maritime vehicles, among others.\nThe worldwide conflicts we continue to witness have taught us drones and robotics needed a solution to allow operations in GPS-challenged environments, Paniccia said.\n\u201cIf a drone\u2019s autopilot uses GPS, and this is disrupted or denied, that drone will hover, stop and crash,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big problem for which, until now, there was no real viable solution. Because the ANELLO X3 is optical, it cannot be jammed or spoofed.\u201d\nPaniccia continued, \u201cOur ANELLO X3 allows for precise aerial navigation in GPS denied environments. It enables beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) flights up to 10km with a lateral error of 100m (0.1%).\u201d\nThis made-in-the-U.S. unit also incorporates an artificial intelligence (AI)-based sensor fusion engine with algorithms that automatically detect a loss of GPS and constantly track location to provide accurate positional information. Other key features include:\n\u25cf <0.5\u00b0/hr Gyro Bias Instability\u25cf <0.05\u00b0/\u2713hr Angular Random Walk\u25cf <20mg Accel Bias Instability\u25cf <5.0W Power Consumption\u25cf <8 in3 Size\u25cf <0.5lbs Weight\u25cf RS-422 or UART Interfaces\nA World of Possibilities\nThese features make the ANELLO X3 a solution for all-domain small and large autonomous defense and commercial applications alike. Paniccia noted users can put the ANELLO X3 \u201con anything that moves.\u201d It can be employed indoors or outdoors on drones, robots, stabilizers and more.\nThe use cases and markets are endless, as are the possibilities for autonomous systems. For surface marine vessels, it can be used for maritime surveying, side-scan sonar and similar applications. Subsea, whether crewed (e.g., submarines) or unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), it can aid in hydrography. For traditional general aviation, helicopters or advanced aviation such as electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL), the ANELLO X3 can establish operational roll, pitch and yaw data. For robotics in general, it can detect and make adjustments for changes in velocity, position or acceleration.\nANELLO Photonics is engaged in trials with its X3 with leaders across various markets, including construction, farming, robotics, trucking, UAVs, autonomous vehicles and the defense space.\nRelated Posts:\nIn this issue:\nHigh-Solar Activity Ionospheric Modeling Leveraging...\nGalileo HAS: A Performance...\nWashington View: Making GPS More...\nCopyright \u00a9 Inside GNSS Media & Research LLC.

        "raw_content": "Global Navigation Satellite Systems Engineering, Policy, and Design\nAnello Reveals GNSS INS System with \u2018World-first\u2019 Optical Gyro\nSanta Clara, CA-based startup Anello Photonics has announced a GNSS INS module that it says is the world\u2019s smallest optical gyro inertial navigation system for GPS-denied navigation and localization. It is powered by the company\u2019s optical gyroscope technology and AI-based sensor fusion engine, the combination engineered to deliver high-accuracy positioning and orientation for applications in the agriculture, construction, robotics, and autonomous vehicle space.\n\u201cWe are actively engaged with customers who need robust, high-precision optical gyro-based solutions for their autonomous applications,\u201d said Dr. Mario Paniccia, CEO of Anello Photonics.\nAnello was co-founded by Paniccia and CTO Mike Horton, pioneers in the field of silicon photonics, sensors, and navigation, with the early support of Catapult Ventures and high-volume fab Tower Semiconductor. Coming out of stealth at CES 2023, Anello displayed the low-noise and -drift SiPhOG\u2122 sensor, which it says is the first silicon photonics optical gyroscope and the smallest optical gyroscope in the world.\n\u201cIt was a very ambitious thing we took on\u2014creating a fiber gyro on a chip,\u201d Paniccia to Inside GNSS. \u201cWe\u2019re measuring a very tiny signal and putting it all into a standard process that\u2019s fabricated in a high-volume fab. To our knowledge, no one\u2019s building or has anything working at this level, let alone full INS systems, with integrated photonics.\u201d\nAccording to Anello, the silicon photonics optical gyroscope technology can be board-mounted and is made with integrated photonics components so it can be processed in high volume just like other integrated circuits. Another key advantage is a low unaided heading drift of less than 0.5\u00b0/h.\n\u201cThis is the sweet spot,\u201d said Paniccia. The MEMS in mobile phones and AirPods\u2014which range from 2.0\u00b0/h, with high temperatures pushing that to hundreds and potentially a thousand degrees per hour\u2014are not accurate enough for the autonomy safety case, he added. Typical fiber gyros, \u201cthe gold standard\u201d for accuracy, are too big, bulky, and expensive.\n\u201cThe idea is to bring the performance of high-precision optical gyros from guided missiles and other high-end applications into a form factor and price point that you can put it into the volume market in the autonomous landscape,\u201d he said.\nFor the new GNSS INS system, the company launched an evaluation kit about a year ago for customer trials.\n\u201cIt\u2019s the smallest in this case, [with] not only the smallest gyro that we\u2019ve developed and announced but now we have the smallest inertial navigation system that can be put into real solutions and real applications,\u201d said Paniccia.\nThe near-term markets for Anello\u2019s technology are in construction and farming \u201cwhere they can pay a little bit of a premium.\u201d An upcoming robotics product uses basically the same core fundamental platform without GPS.\nIn the future, the company is working to deliver to the high-volume auto market, and that means not only ASIL-D specs but also immunity to temperature and vibration with lower power consumption.\n\u201cWe\u2019re trying to gear towards ADAS (L2 plus, L3) over time,\u201d concluded Paniccia.\nRelated Posts:\nIn this issue:\nHigh-Solar Activity Ionospheric Modeling Leveraging...\nGalileo HAS: A Performance...\nWashington View: Making GPS More...\nCopyright \u00a9 Inside GNSS Media & Research LLC.
