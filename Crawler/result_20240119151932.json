Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung have unveiled transparent TVs at the show, with LG having just announced its OLED-powered display will go on sale later this year.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u2019s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode.\n\u201cThe unique thing about OLED is it\u2019s an organic material that we can print on any type of surface,\u201d explains David Park from LG\u2019s Home Entertainment Division.\n\u201cAnd so what we\u2019ve done is printed it on a transparent piece of glass, and then to get the OLED picture quality, that\u2019s where we have that contrast film that goes up and down.\u201d\nContent is delivered wirelessly to the display using LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box which sends 4K images and sound.\nWhy would you need a transparent TV?\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, the OLED T can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\nSamsung\u2019s transparent MICRO LED-powered display showed off the technology as a concept.\n___\nADS COMING TO SHOPPING CARTS\nFood companies advertise all over the grocery store with eye-catching packaging and displays. Now, Instacart hopes they\u2019ll start advertising right on your cart.\nThis week at CES, the San Francisco-based grocery delivery and technology company is unveiling a smart cart that shows video ads on a screen near the handle. General Mills, Del Monte Foods, and Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream are among the companies who will advertise on the carts during an upcoming pilot at West Coast stores owned by Good Food Holdings.\nInstacart says a screen might advertise deals or show a limited-edition treat, like Chocolate Strawberry Cheerios. It might also share real-time recommendations based on what customers put in the cart, like advertising ice cream if a customer buys cones.\nInstacart got into the cart business in 2021 when it bought Caper, which makes smart carts with cameras and sensors that automatically keep track of items placed in them. Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Revealing innovative feature-packed TVs, sound bars and mobile devices to inspire greatness and deliver more meaningful experiences, TCL is once again pushing the envelope with its latest product introductions.\n\u201cComing out of such a strong 2023 has TCL excited to up the ante this year as we prepare to launch more innovation, including the world\u2019s largest Mini LED TV at a jaw-dropping 115\u201d screen size. Going bigger is just one of the ways we continue to strive to be the best-selling TV brand in the U.S. We will also deliver much better quality, technology, and value for our users thanks to our vertical integration strengths,\u201d said Mark Zhang, President, TCL North America. \u201cIn order to turn one of the world\u2019s largest TV manufacturers into America\u2019s preferred consumer electronics brand, we will also continue to invest our resources beyond televisions so TCL\u2019s audio, mobile and home appliance categories become just as successful.\u201d\nTCL Television\nKnown for offering the best combination of quality, technology, and value, in 2024 TCL will raise the bar in TV technology. At the top of the TCL Q Class will be the new QM7 and QM8 QD Mini LED models. These sets are premium Mini LED utilizing high-zone local dimming and incorporating advanced TCL backlight and processing technologies. The flagship QM8 level will also add a new mega-size 115\u201d model, which will be the world\u2019s largest QD Mini LED TV. In addition, TCL will expand its 98\u201d QLED TV offering with three new models at the Q6, QM7 and QM8 levels.\nIn S Class, TCL will introduce the new S5. This best-in-class 4K UHD level will offer up to 25% more brightness and for the first time at the S Class level, will incorporate the TCL AIPQ Processor to ensure the bright images are also sharp and clear.\nFor 2024, TCL TV has moved to the next level in Mini LED backlight technology with QD Mini LED, enhanced QLED Color, three levels of TCL AIPQ Processing including in S Class, built-in Multi-Channel TV sound, new features such as Enhanced Dialog Mode for easy listening, improved FullView 360 cosmetic design, which is enhanced from the front, side and rear, and expanded larger sizes including the mega-size 115\u201d screen.\nTCL Audio\nTo complement its new TVs, TCL will take sound to all new heights by introducing a full line of Dolby Atmos sound bars. TCL\u2019s Q Class sound bars complete a high quality home theater. In 2024, the Q75H and Q85H models will include Ray-Danz acoustic wave-guide reflectors for a super wide sound stage. The Q75H is a 5.1.2 sound bar that includes built-in Dolby Atmos up firing speakers, and built-in side surround speakers, for premium surround sound. The Q85H is a 7.1.4 sound bar that adds wireless rear speakers which incorporate rear Dolby Atmos up firing drivers, for truly enveloping sound.\nS Class sound bars include the S45H and S55H models, which are upgraded with Dolby Atmos, Auto Room Calibration, TV as Center Channel Mode, and a beautiful new cosmetic design. The S45H model includes a Built-in Bass Reflex Port for enhanced bass without a separate subwoofer, while the S55H adds a Wireless Subwoofer for room filling sound.\nTCL Mobile\nA leader in display technology across feature-rich smartphones, tablets, and connected devices, TCL also announced at CES 2024 its latest advancements aimed at making technology more human and 5G more accessible. Most notable was the debut of TCL NXTPAPER 3.0, the latest generation of TCL's pioneering display technology. TCL expanded its tablet portfolio and demonstrated the 50 Series of smartphones, affirming its commitment to democratize 5G and underscoring TCL's relentless dedication to developing technology that smoothly integrates into our everyday lives.\nThe TCL NXTPAPER 14 Pro and TAB 10 NXTPAPER 5G tablets, for the U.S. market, are a testament to TCL's focus on the integration of innovative technology, user-centric design, and digital well-being.\nThe brand-new TCL 50 Series marks TCL's fifth generation of smartphones, bringing an array of distinctive models, from 5G devices to an extended selection of NXTPAPER smartphones.

This builds on the groundbreaking full-color binocular, wave guided OLED displays of the previous generation, but is the first manufacturer to add the power of the Snapdragon AR1 processor platform. The lighter and more stylish design also means they can be worn for longer, in real-world conditions.\nTCL Home Appliances\nA global leader in appliances, TCL offers a wide range of home products in North America and will continue to build out the category with innovative solutions.

        "raw_content": "What TCL announced at CES 2024\nA NXTPaper tablet and one giant TV.\nIt\u2019s CES 2024 this week, in case you haven\u2019t noticed, and most of the major players in consumer tech are hosting their own shiny press events. TCL is no exception. The manufacturer is holding a livestream event on January 8 at 2PM ET. You can watch it on the company\u2019s website or YouTube, just in case you aren\u2019t anywhere near Las Vegas.\nWhat we expect\nTCL is a huge company that manufacturers a wide range of devices across multiple product categories, though it\u2019s most famous for its TVs. The company promises to showcase over 100 \u201ccutting-edge products\u201d throughout CES, including QD-Mini LED TVs, air conditioners, refrigerators, washing machines, mobile devices, commercial displays and much more.\nMore specifically, TCL plans on unveiling \u201cone of the world\u2019s largest\u201d QD-Mini LED TVs during the press conference. It already announced a 115-inch behemoth at IFA back in September, so this one would have to match or exceed that size.\nIt also promises a spate of new home theater products and a new device ecosystem that\u2019s being advertised as \u201cone of the industry\u2019s first smart connected mobile device entertainment solutions.\u201d TCL's being cagey on this one, though the company did say the tech would integrate with smartphones, tablets, smart glasses and other gadgets.\nTCL also tends to announce one or two quirky things, like last year\u2019s RayNeo X2 AR glasses. The company has teased something regarding this product for CES, though it remains to be seen if it's a full hardware refresh or just a system update. The company did make an off-hand mention about \u201cpowerful AI capabilities.\u201d\nFinally, there\u2019s a promise to show off the \u201clatest breakthroughs in display technology.\u201d This likely refers to the company\u2019s NXTPAPER tech, which optimizes displays for the human eye. This platform got a refresh back in February, but it looks like the color paper-like screen technology will be getting even more bells and whistles. In any event, we don\u2019t have long to find out.\nWhat TCL announced\nTCL unveiled the NXTPAPER 14 Pro, a large-format device that's both a tablet and giant e-reader. Our own Mat Smith got hands-on ahead of CES and his first impressions are now live. Separately, on a much different note, TCL also debuted a 115-inch TV, which it says is the largest MiniLED with Quantum Dot technology. The announcement is notable in that it better positions TCL (normally best known for budget TVs) to compete with premium brands like Sony, Samsung and LG.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12.

Panasonic first brought its lineup to the European market in 2008, and in May 2023, became the first Japanese manufacturer to introduce products that use the environmentally friendly natural refrigerant, R290.\nPanasonic is developing high-performance electrodes for water electrolysis systems used in green hydrogen production.\u00a0These electrodes feature a high-activity catalyst material made of nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (Ni-Fe LDH), which achieves high performance without using precious metals. Utilizing electrodes makes it possible to significantly enhance the performance of contemporary water electrolysis systems and substantially reduce the production cost of green hydrogen.\nThis is a concept exhibit for the central air conditioning system proposed by Panasonic. Compared to standard whole-house air conditioning, which pumps in air every time the interior temperature changes, a central air conditioning system constantly circulates air at the preferred temperature, ensuring uniformity throughout the structure. Ventilation technology also helps to provide a comfortable and clean air environment.\nDERMS will leverage the latest IT capabilities to manage the generation and provision of locally sourced green energy to customers at their locations. It will also help counteract the inherent instability of renewable energy output by enhancing energy storage and delivery capabilities. Panasonic\u2019s DERMS solutions will contribute to accelerating the implementation of renewable energy across society. The exhibit will also use panels and videos to introduce Panasonic\u2019s efforts to ensure the safety of DERMS through monitoring and rapid detection of cyber-attacks.\u00a0For now, Panasonic is expanding verification with electric power companies and transportation companies to accelerate verification of business scaling.\nThis renewable energy solution uses 5 kW pure hydrogen fuel cell generators, which can be connected in networks of up to 250 units depending on power demand and location. This solution combines these generators with photovoltaic generators and storage batteries for highly integrated control of power generation, adding a storage battery system to manage power supply and demand in accordance with fluctuations in power demand and renewable energy output due to weather conditions. The company plans to start PoC demonstrations at Panasonic bases in the UK, Germany in FY2025.\nThis solution is the first in the industry to support simultaneous charging and discharging of EVs and storage batteries. Integration with AiSEG2 improves self-consumption of photovoltaic power. Features automatic charging of EVs and storage batteries based on weather warnings, and industry-leading self-sustaining output during power outages, to support a near-normal lifestyle.\nPanasonic aims to respond to customer needs by integrating solar power into unconventional spaces, such as windows and walls. PSCs represent a groundbreaking advancement in solar technology, offering a distinctive advantage in terms of their applicability.\u00a0Unique material and industrial inkjet coating technology enables the creation of glass-integrated solar cells, allowing for customizable and versatile designs with high conversion efficiency.

Panasonic\u2019s future approach to consumer electronics manufacturing will be introduced through visual images.\nPanasonic is proceeding with initiatives to reduce the use of resin (plastic) based on the characteristics of individual products.\nWith the goal of contributing to the circular economy, this exhibit and video presentation will introduce the technologies that make refurbishing feasible. Applying manufacturing knowledge and expertise cultivated over many years, Panasonic has the technology to recycle used products and the knowledge to ensure quality through inspections and performance tests. In Japan, Panasonic are now verifying recycled products for some of its TVs and washing machines to reduce the number of products that are discarded due to defects occurring during delivery and installation, and to establish a product circulation scheme.\nPanasonic is building a system that closes the resource loop, from manufacturing to recycling to recycled resin, based on the concept of \u201cFrom Product to Product\u201d. By determining the characteristics of each recycled PP, PS, and ABS, the company has established techniques that use optimal formulations for resin parts, such as adding the group\u2019s own antioxidants and blending recycled resin with new resin materials. This enables reproduction at a level suitable for home appliances.\nResource Optimization\nPanasonic aims to reduce its global environmental impact and build a better relationship with the natural environment by optimizing the use of waste and carbon across the global organization.\nA newly developed photosynthetic microorganism transforms atmospheric CO2 into plant growth-promoting molecules that stimulate crop photosynthesis-related metabolisms and enhance yields. The photosynthesis-based CO2 transformation processes address the world's growing need for foodstuffs while taking a circular approach to carbon neutrality.\nDevelopment of moldable (pellet-like) materials made from natural fibers extracted from plant resources such as thinned wood and waste wood mixed with resin.Like conventional resins, it can be molded, colored, and processed, and is expected to find applications in a variety of products.\nReduce food waste by raising awareness of local foods and building a system that allows local residents to appreciate their \u201cgood value.\u201d In cooperation with local governments, the company will provide a food sharing service platform and subsidize the lending of kitchen waste disposal equipment to residents.\nEAT WELL\nThrough a food culture tailored to the needs and tastes of each individual, Panasonic will help people adopt a healthy lifestyle.\nAs one of the leading \u00a0microwave brands with Inverter technology, Panasonic is constantly striving to make it easier for families to eat well. Panasonic and Fresco will collaborate to deliver a revolutionary cooking assistant for Panasonic\u2019s multi-functional countertop ovens and will showcase this connected cooking experience in the booth.\nFEEL WELL\nThrough easy daily self-care, Panasonic will help keep bodies healthy.\nThe Panasonic EH-NA0J hair dryer, equipped with nanoe\u2122 MOISTURE+ and Mineral, provides moisture to the inside of the hair while mineral ions care for the cuticles, leading to a smooth finish that is resistant to damage. With continued use it can reduce friction damage from brushing, helping to achieve smooth and silky hair. This advanced technology, combined with its compact design, intelligent sensing, and various modes makes it an ideal tool for hair care.\nThe MULTISHAPE by Panasonic now delves into skincare and footcare with new attachments, offering exfoliating and cleansing brushes, in addition to a callus-removing footcare tool. Furthermore, Panasonic is also introducing new detail trimmer and hair clipper attachments. These new heads further expand the possibilities of the modular grooming system, which uses a single rechargeable base to reduce resource consumption by 60 percent. MULTISHAPE thus evolves into an all-encompassing, sustainable grooming device for diverse personal care routines.\nThe Panasonic ARC3 3-Blade Shaver, with inspiration drawn from the classic Star Wars\u2122 trilogy is packed with cutting-edge technology and a premium stormtrooper-inspired design that mimics the iconic armor of a Star Wars stormtrooper.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "Simple navigation\nCES 2024: Panasonic Group to Exhibit Products,\nTechnologies for Realizing Its Vision for Future Lifestyles\nLas Vegas - At CES 2024, the Panasonic Group will showcase technologies and products that build on the concept of \u201cCreate Today. Enrich Tomorrow.\u201d Under the three categories of \u201cSustainable Energy,\u201d \u201cCircular Economy,\u201d and \u201cResource Optimization,\u201d Panasonic will introduce concrete facts that will help the Group realize its vision of the lifestyle of the future. The latest products and solutions for enhancing each person\u2019s quality of life will also be exhibited.\nAs part of its long-term environmental vision, Panasonic GREEN IMPACT (PGI), Panasonic is taking an environmentally friendly approach to booth design. For example, Panasonic has incorporated joints made from high concentration cellulose fiber molding material \u201ckinari\u201d into its display tables; these tables will be used not only at CES, but at future exhibitions as well. Panasonic is also minimizing the use of building materials and carpeting.\nLive Streaming the Panasonic Press Conference\u00a0The Panasonic CES 2024 press conference (Monday, January 8, 2024, 10:00-10:45 PST) will be streamed online at https://panasonic.com/CES.\nMain Exhibits at LVCC:Panasonic Booth Overview\nCES Unveiled Las Vegas:Shiftall Booth Overview\nPanasonic CES 2024 Press Kits:https://na.panasonic.com/us/ces\nMain Exhibition Booth Highlights:The main presentation linked to the exhibition lineup will be shown in the theater at the entrance. Dioramas and representative examples will be placed in the center of each category to express Panasonic\u2019s vision for that segment.\nPanasonic GREEN IMPACTIntroduces \u201cPanasonic GREEN IMPACT,\u201d the Panasonic Group's commitment to achieving both a better life for people and a sustainable global environment. By reducing its carbon footprint, helping reduce emissions across society, and realizing a circular economy, the Group can ensure that its actions have impact.\nSustainable EnergyBy promoting the diffusion of electrification from people\u2019s homes to society, Panasonic will create a zero-CO2 society that does not require fossil fuels and that uses only renewable energy for social activities. These products and solutions will be introduced using projection mapping dioramas.\nEV Devices and SolutionsThe Panasonic Group will introduce a wide range of in-vehicle device solutions that contribute to the adoption of EVs. The exhibit will use lights and touch panels to intuitively show how Panasonic\u2019s products and technologies are used in various places throughout the car to solve environmental issues and contribute to the realization of a comfortable cabin while promoting safety and security.\nAir-to-Water Heat PumpSince Panasonic\u2019s Air-to-Water Heat Pump collects and exchanges heat from ambient air; it is an environmentally friendly heating system that can reduce CO2 emissions compared to conventional combustion-type heating equipment that uses fossil fuels.\u00a0It is also possible to remotely monitor the operating status of the system, and the Group has established a system that can respond quickly in the event of a problem. Panasonic first brought its lineup to the European market in 2008, and in May 2023, became the first Japanese manufacturer to introduce products that use the environmentally friendly natural refrigerant, R290.\nGreen Hydrogen Production\u00a0Panasonic is developing high-performance electrodes for water electrolysis systems used in green hydrogen production.\u00a0These electrodes feature a high-activity catalyst material made of nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (Ni-Fe LDH), which achieves high performance without using precious metals. Utilizing electrodes makes it possible to significantly enhance the performance of contemporary water electrolysis systems and substantially reduce the production cost of green hydrogen.\nCentral Air ConditioningThis is a concept exhibit for the central air conditioning system proposed by Panasonic. Compared to standard whole-house air conditioning, which pumps in air every time the interior temperature changes, a central air conditioning system constantly circulates air at the preferred temperature, ensuring uniformity throughout the structure. Ventilation technology also helps to provide a comfortable and clean air environment.\nDERMS: Distributed Energy Resource Management System\u00a0DERMS will leverage the latest IT capabilities to manage the generation and provision of locally sourced green energy to customers at their locations. It will also help counteract the inherent instability of renewable energy output by enhancing energy storage and delivery capabilities. Panasonic\u2019s DERMS solutions will contribute to accelerating the implementation of renewable energy across society. The exhibit will also use panels and videos to introduce Panasonic\u2019s efforts to ensure the safety of DERMS through monitoring and rapid detection of cyber-attacks.\u00a0For now, Panasonic is expanding verification with electric power companies and transportation companies to accelerate verification of business scaling.\nRenewable Energy Solution Using HydrogenThis renewable energy solution uses 5 kW pure hydrogen fuel cell generators, which can be connected in networks of up to 250 units depending on power demand and location. This solution combines these generators with photovoltaic generators and storage batteries for highly integrated control of power generation, adding a storage battery system to manage power supply and demand in accordance with fluctuations in power demand and renewable energy output due to weather conditions. The company plans to start PoC demonstrations at Panasonic bases in the UK, Germany in FY2025.\nV2H Storage Battery SystemThis solution is the first in the industry to support simultaneous charging and discharging of EVs and storage batteries. Integration with AiSEG2 improves self-consumption of photovoltaic power. Features automatic charging of EVs and storage batteries based on weather warnings, and industry-leading self-sustaining output during power outages, to support a near-normal lifestyle.\nPerovskite Solar Cells (PSCs)\u00a0Panasonic aims to respond to customer needs by integrating solar power into unconventional spaces, such as windows and walls. PSCs represent a groundbreaking advancement in solar technology, offering a distinctive advantage in terms of their applicability.\u00a0Unique material and industrial inkjet coating technology enables the creation of glass-integrated solar cells, allowing for customizable and versatile designs with high conversion efficiency. Perovskite solar modules of practical size (>800 cm2) have the world\u2019s highest class conversion efficiency*1. With the potential to seamlessly incorporate solar power generation into glass structures, such as windows, walls, and facades, PSCs redefine the possibilities for renewable energy integration.*1 Certified by Panasonic and an independent third party\nCircular EconomyMinimizing the use of resources, extending the life of products, and accelerating circular lifestyles with low environmental impact through systems and services that keep customers connected for a long time. Panasonic\u2019s future approach to consumer electronics manufacturing will be introduced through visual images.\nPlastic ReductionPanasonic is proceeding with initiatives to reduce the use of resin (plastic) based on the characteristics of individual products.\nProducts RecraftedWith the goal of contributing to the circular economy, this exhibit and video presentation will introduce the technologies that make refurbishing feasible. Applying manufacturing knowledge and expertise cultivated over many years, Panasonic has the technology to recycle used products and the knowledge to ensure quality through inspections and performance tests. In Japan, Panasonic are now verifying recycled products for some of its TVs and washing machines to reduce the number of products that are discarded due to defects occurring during delivery and installation, and to establish a product circulation scheme.\nResource RecyclingPanasonic is building a system that closes the resource loop, from manufacturing to recycling to recycled resin, based on the concept of \u201cFrom Product to Product.\u201d By determining the characteristics of each recycled PP, PS, and ABS, the company has established techniques that use optimal formulations for resin parts, such as adding the group\u2019s own antioxidants and blending recycled resin with new resin materials. This enables reproduction at a level suitable for home appliances.\nResource OptimizationPanasonic aims to reduce its global environmental impact and build a better relationship with the natural environment by optimizing the use of waste and carbon across the global organization.\nBio CO2 Crop Growth Technology\u00a0A newly developed photosynthetic microorganism transforms atmospheric CO2 into plant growth-promoting molecules that stimulate crop photosynthesis-related metabolisms and enhance yields. The photosynthesis-based CO2 transformation processes address the world's growing need for foodstuffs while taking a circular approach to carbon neutrality.\nkinari\u2122 ResinDevelopment of moldable (pellet-like) materials made from natural fibers extracted from plant resources such as thinned wood and waste wood mixed with resin.Like conventional resins, it can be molded, colored, and processed, and is expected to find applications in a variety of products.\nReducing Food WasteReduce food waste by raising awareness of local foods and building a system that allows local residents to appreciate their \u201cgood value.\u201d In cooperation with local governments, the company will provide a food sharing service platform and subsidize the lending of kitchen waste disposal equipment to residents.\nEAT WELLThrough a food culture tailored to the needs and tastes of each individual, Panasonic will help people adopt a healthy lifestyle.\nMicrowave OvensAs one of the leading \u00a0microwave brands with Inverter technology, Panasonic is constantly striving to make it easier for families to eat well. Panasonic and Fresco will collaborate to deliver a revolutionary cooking assistant for Panasonic\u2019s multi-functional countertop ovens and will showcase this connected cooking experience in the booth.\nFEEL WELLThrough easy daily self-care, Panasonic will help keep bodies healthy.\nEH-NA0J Hair DryerThe Panasonic EH-NA0J hair dryer, equipped with nanoe\u2122 MOISTURE+ and Mineral, provides moisture to the inside of the hair while mineral ions care for the cuticles, leading to a smooth finish that is resistant to damage. With continued use it can reduce friction damage from brushing, helping to achieve smooth and silky hair. This advanced technology, combined with its compact design, intelligent sensing, and various modes makes it an ideal tool for hair care.\nMULTISHAPE Modular System and attachmentsThe MULTISHAPE by Panasonic now delves into skincare and footcare with new attachments, offering exfoliating and cleansing brushes, in addition to a callus-removing footcare tool. Furthermore, Panasonic is also introducing new detail trimmer and hair clipper attachments. These new heads further expand the possibilities of the modular grooming system, which uses a single rechargeable base to reduce resource consumption by 60 percent. MULTISHAPE thus evolves into an all-encompassing, sustainable grooming device for diverse personal care routines.\nARC3 STAR WARS\u2122 Shaver\u00a0The Panasonic ARC3 3-Blade Shaver, with inspiration drawn from the classic Star Wars\u2122 trilogy is packed with cutting-edge technology and a premium stormtrooper-inspired design that mimics the iconic armor of a Star Wars stormtrooper. The ES-SWLT2W includes three advanced Japanese stainless-steel blades that are designed for use on all types of beard hair to provide a close and comfortable shave, even with everyday use.\nPalm ShaverIntroducing the Palm Shaver by Panasonic: a luxurious, palm-sized shaver which redefines the shaving experience with its 70% smaller design compared to traditional shavers.

As the automotive industry is undergoing a transformative period, CES has emerged as a crucial platform for unveiling groundbreaking technological advancements. Even as traditional auto shows decline, CES stands out as the premier event for automotive announcements, attracting major brands from around the world.\nFor automotive enthusiasts, this event is a window into the future, revealing the cutting-edge developments that major car manufacturers have in store. This year, the focus is not much on flashy vehicle debuts but on in-cabin tech innovation, reflecting the industry's shift toward connected, electric and autonomous vehicles.\nNotably, the Detroit Big 3 automakers \u2014 including General Motors, Ford and Stellantis \u2014 won\u2019t be participating at the CES this year following disruptions caused by the historic UAW strike in late 2023. Despite notable absences, including major U.S. automakers and industry disruptors like Tesla, the stage is set for an exciting showcase from global giants like Honda HMC, Hyundai, Kia, Volkswagen VWAGY, BMW AG BMWYY and Mercedes-Benz MBGAF.\nHonda's Leap Into the EV Future\nAmong the automakers, Honda is expected to take center stage at CES 2024 with the debut of its all-new global electric vehicle (EV) series. Aligned with its ambitious goal of carbon neutrality by 2050, Honda plans to introduce 30 EVs globally, targeting a sales volume of 2 million units by 2030.

Honda's CES showcase will not only feature the new EV series but also highlight key technologies shaping the brand's transformation.\nKia's Visionary Mobility Platform\nKia\u2019s showcase at CES 2024 revolves around its groundbreaking modular EV platform, the Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV). This platform underpins three all-electric concept cars \u2014 PV1, PV5 and PV7, each catering to different segments of personal and B2B mobility. PV5, set to be launched in 2025, is a three-row van combining futuristic design and practicality. Kia's partnership with Uber and the announcement of a robotaxi version by 2028 underscores its commitment to revolutionizing mobility.\nHyundai's Software-Defined Vision\nHyundai stands out as a prominent player at CES 2024, showcasing its vision for a technologically advanced, environmentally friendly future. Its concept of \"software-defined everything\" illustrates a future where technology seamlessly integrates into our lives. At CES 2024, Hyundai is set to unveil its new E/E architecture for software-defined vehicles (SDV), a testament to its innovation in vehicle technology.\nThe company's vision extends beyond cars, with a focus on hydrogen-powered transformations and the potential of AI in advancing mobility solutions.Hyundai will present its waste-to-hydrogen production and hydrogen value chain, emphasizing a comprehensive approach to future mobility concepts.

Demonstrations include remote driving experiences, AR glasses for passengers and an Intelligent Personal Assistant enhanced with generative AI. The German auto giant\u2019s focus on the digital customer experience emphasizes the integration of cutting-edge technology in everyday vehicle use.\nMercedes-Benz's AI-Powered MBUX Virtual Assistant\nMercedes-Benz is set to impress with the unveiling of its new MBUX Virtual Assistant at CES 2024, aiming to redefine the digital passenger experience. This AI-powered feature represents a leap in personalization and human-like interaction between driver and car. The MBUX Virtual Assistant, part of Mercedes-Benz's vision for connected driving, promises an empathetic and responsive in-car experience.\nOla K\u00e4llenius, CEO of Mercedes-Benz, emphasizes the empathetic qualities of the MBUX Virtual Assistant, stating that it complements the driver's style and mood. This technology is set to gradually appear in passenger vehicles over the coming years, marking a significant leap toward connected and personalized driving experiences.\nVolkswagen's ChatGPT Integration\nVolkswagen will take a leap into artificial intelligence by integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into its IDA voice assistant. This move makes Volkswagen the first volume manufacturer to offer ChatGPT as a standard feature, starting in the second quarter of 2024. The integration of OpenAI\u2019s chatbot across VW\u2019s lineup, including Tiguan, Passat, Golf, and its ID family of electric vehicles, highlights the automaker's commitment to cutting-edge technology and enhanced customer experience.\nThe AI-based chatbot enhances the voice assistant's capabilities, providing relevant responses and control over entertainment. Volkswagen's partnership with Cerence ensures a robust integration of ChatGPT, marking a significant step toward AI-driven interactions within vehicles.\nFlying Cars on Display\nCES 2024 will showcase two companies presenting \"flying cars.\" XPeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's XPeng Inc., will introduce an electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft. Hyundai's Advanced Air Mobility company, Supernal, will also showcase an eVTOL vehicle prototype, highlighting the growing interest and innovation in the aerial mobility sector.\nConclusion\nCES 2024 paints a futuristic picture of the automotive industry, with a focus on technology that goes beyond traditional vehicle design. As the world watches these innovations unfold at CES, it's evident that the automotive industry is at the forefront of the tech revolution, where EVs, AI, and software-defined technologies are not just concepts but imminent realities.\nFrom global EV series and modular platforms to software-defined vehicles and AI-powered virtual assistants, major car manufacturers are showcasing their commitment to shaping a connected, electric and autonomous future. The integration of AI in vehicles, both in voice assistants and advanced chatbots, signals a paradigm shift in how we interact with our cars.\nThe convergence of technology and automotive expertise at CES 2024 underlines a clear message \u2014 the future of mobility is here and it's electrifying.\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?
