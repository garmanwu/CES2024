        "raw_content": "Mullen Five RS revealed at CES 2024 with claimed 1,000 horsepower\nIt also packs a two-speed transmission\nElectric automaker Mullen came to CES 2024 with some serious firepower. It revealed the Five RS, the high-performance version of the Five electric SUV that was originally shown in L.A. a little more than two years ago. And compared to the Five, it has far flashier styling and impressive claimed performance numbers.\nThe demure shape of the Five has been turned into something that wouldn't be out of place at SEMA. It looks lower in general, which is accentuated by the aggressive front spoiler, side skirts, fender flares and rear diffuser. It even has an additional grille in the front. And naturally it has a big wing on top. It sits on 21-inch wheels as standard, with 22-inch wheels available as options. And the inside is similar, as it starts with the fairly calm Five interior, but adds Alcantara, carbon fiber seat backs and trim, and a bigger driver instrument screen.\nBut more interesting are the mechanical details. They're just targets for the moment, but they are attention-grabbing. It will feature dual motors with at least 1,000 horsepower and 850 pound-feet of torque. Curiously, it will have a two-speed transmission (presumably for each motor), which bucks the trend of many EVs having just a single speed. It's not the only one, the Porsche Taycan has a two-speed setup, but certainly uncommon. Those motors will apparently push the 5,070-pound to 50 in under 2 seconds and eventually up to a 200-mph top speed.\nSupplying power to the Five RS's motors is a larger 100-kWh capacity battery. It will use an 800-volt architecture and apparently will still charge to 80% in a claimed 21 minutes like the regular Five's 95-kWh battery pack. Range does decrease down to a targeted 300 miles as opposed to 325. We wouldn't be surprised if the heavier wheels, likely stickier tires and increased drag from the different body work.\nMullen is also including impressive stopping power. The Five RS will have Brembo carbon ceramic brakes all the way around. The fronts are 15.7-inch rotors with six-piston calipers and the rears are 14.6-inch rotors with four-piston calipers. Mullen claims stopping distances of 110 feet or less from 60 mph.\nExact pricing isn't shown on the site for the Five RS, but will almost certainly be more than the $55,000 starting price of the regular Five. Delivery dates also haven't been given. But interested customers can put down a $500 refundable deposit to reserve one.\nPopular Now\nHertz's Tesla liquidation sale likely means more depreciation for used EVs\n2025 Cadillac CT5-V and CT5-V Blackwing get refreshed styling, massive screen\n2025 VW GTI revealed: Buttons return but the stickshift retires\nWhat car dealership employees earn: Lots of money\n2024 Mercedes-Benz E-Class: Sleek new sedan's pricing revealed\nTesla plans to build new 'Redwood' model in mid-2025\nFollow Us\nResearch\nPopular Vehicles\nPopular New Vehicles\nPopular Used Vehicles\nPopular Electric Vehicles\nPopular Truck Vehicles\nPopular Crossover Vehicles\nPopular Luxury Vehicles\nPopular Hybrid Vehicles\nPopular Makes\nFeatured Makes\nProduct Guides\nChoose a Display Name\nPlease enter a display name\nSign in to post\nPlease sign in to leave a comment."

The plant's former owner was AM General, which built Hummers and the Mercedes-Benz R-Class at the site. Mullen is accepting reservations for the Five and has previously hinted at production starting in 2024.\nThe RS version will boast more than 1,000 hp, or enough for 0-60 mph acceleration in less than two seconds, according to Mullen. The company has also previously hinted at a top speed of more than 200 mph. Such performance would place the Five RS in the same league as EVs like Tesla's Plaid versions of the Model S and Model X, as well as Rimac's Nevera hypercar.\nMullen Five\nThere are no details on pricing or range, but Mullen has previously said the standard Five will start at about $55,000 and come with a range of 325 miles. The standard Five is also said to come with enough horsepower for 0-60 acceleration in 3.2 seconds and a top speed of 155 mph.\nIn addition to the Five, Mullen plans to launch its own version of the Qiantu K50, a Chinese electric sports car that Mullen will rename the GT. The standard GT will have about 375 hp but Mullen is also working on an RS version that is promised with similar performance as the Five RS.\nMullen also operates in the commercial vehicles space. The company already offers Mullen-branded electric vans and trucks, and with an acquisition of fellow EV startup Bollinger in 2022, Mullen also plans to launch electric trucks under the Bollinger brand. It will also revive plans for Bollinger's B1 and B2 electric SUV and pickup truck.\nThis year's CES is scheduled for Jan. 9-12 at the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nTags:\nContribute:\nPeople who read this, also read:\nShare This Article:\nconnect with the editor:\nFollow Us Today:\nMost Popular This Week\nMotor Authority Newsletter\nSign up to get the latest performance and luxury automotive news, delivered to your inbox daily!\nI agree to receive emails from Motor Authority.

        "raw_content": "Clay Webster\nFXStreet\nMullen Automotive Stock Forecast: MULN revs up as CES 2024 gets underway\nMullen Automotive (MULN) stock clocked in with its best performance of the year so far with a 9.8% gain on Tuesday. MULN surged nearly 15% earlier in the session as the underdog electric vehicle maker unveiled its Mullen Five RS vehicle at Las Vegas\u2019 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) before backtracking.\nThe CES is the premier venue for all things consumer tech, and Mullen was excited to show off\u00a0a raft of its newest vehicles alongside other more well-known manufacturers like Mercedes-Benz and Honda.\nMullen stock news: Mullen Five debuts at CES 2024\nThe Mullen Five crossover, the company\u2019s first foray in the passenger electric vehicle (EV) market, won\u2019t be released to the public until 2025 at the earliest, but already Mullen is showing off its high-performance version.\nThe Mullen Five RS boasts top speeds of more than 200 MPH and acceleration of 0 to 60 MPH in less than two seconds. The crossover also comes equipped with more than 1,000 horsepower.\nIn addition to the Mullen Five RS, the electric automaker will show off its two commercial vehicles already in production. These are the Mullen One electric delivery van and the Mullen Three electric chassis semi-truck cab.\nThe Bollinger 1 SUV, Bollinger 2 pickup truck and the Bollinger 4 semi-truck chassis cab\u00a0will also be on display at the Las Vegas Convention Center through Friday, January 12.\nMullen announced on Monday that it has applied for a $50 million grant that would be used for equipment to produce more efficient battery packs for its vehicles. The Department of Energy is issuing grants as part of its $3.5 billion Funding Opportunity for Battery Materials initiative that is part of the Biden administration\u2019s bipartisan infrastructure bill.\nMullen Automotive FAQs\nWhat is Mullen Automotive?\nMullen Automotive is a publicly-traded development-stage electric vehicle company based in Brea, California that typically uses outside partnerships to manufacture its vehicles. The company was founded in 2014 and currently sells self-designed electric delivery vehicles. Besides its commercial offerings, Mullen plans to begin manufacturing its Mullen FIVE EV crossover in late 2024 or early 2025. Mullen Automotive went public on the NASDAQ exchange through a reverse merger in late 2021.\nWho is the team behind Mullen Automotive?\nDavid Michery has been the company\u2019s CEO since he founded and incorporated the company in 2014. The existing company came from the merging of CODA Automotive and Mullen Motor Cars through acquisition. Michery is joined by Chief Financial Officer Jonathan New, Chief Commercial Officer John Schwegman and President of the Automotive Division Calin Popa.\nWhat vehicles does Mullen Automotive currently offer?\nThrough a partnership with Randy Marion Automotive Group, Mullen distributes its Mullen One delivery van that has an electric range of 110 miles. Through an agreement with a Chinese manufacturer and distributor based in Ireland, the company also distributes the Mullen-GO Commercial Urban Delivery EV in Europe. In July 2023, Mullen will begin commercial production at its facility in Mississippi of its Class 3 EV Cab Chassis long-haul truck for immediate delivery. Through its 60% ownership stake in Bollinger Motors, Mullen will also reap the benefits of that company\u2019s B1 SUV and B2 pickup truck, as well as other commercial vehicles in the future. The Mullen FIVE crossover vehicle is not slated for production until at least late 2024, but it is already taking reservations.\nWhy does MULN stock trade for such a low share price?\nMullen has been diluting its stock since going public in late 2021. This is because the company as of yet currently has little revenue from operations and no profits. The stock has fallen over 99% since the company\u2019s reverse merger in November 2021, and the rapid dilution is mostly to blame. Taking into account Mullen\u2019s 1-for-25 reverse stock split on May 4, 2023, Mullen had 33,338,727 shares outstanding on September 30, 2022, but 126,281,274 shares on March 31, 2023. The company is allowed to sell up to 200 million shares under current authorization.\nMullen stock forecast\nEven before Tuesday's surge in the MULN stock price level, the EV company's share price was showing signs of bullishness. On Monday, the 9-day Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossed above its 21-day counterpart. This is evidence that momentum is building for the long discarded penny stock.\nMullen's reverse stock split in December has met with renewed interest in the automaker among traders, though much of the market is still wary that the automaker will need to raise further equity funding to carry out its strategy. Now bulls will need to push through resistance in the area surrounding $18. This is where rallies met their demise on September 21 and 29. Support arrives at $8.\nMULN daily chart\nInformation on these pages contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties.

(NASDAQ: MULN), an emerging electric vehicle (\u201cEV\u201d) manufacturer, today announces financial results for the twelve months ended Sept. 30, 2023, and a current business update.\nCommenting on fiscal year 2023 (\u201cFY2023\u201d) and recent Company developments, CEO and chairman David Michery stated, \u201cMullen has initiated production in Tunica and rolled out a significant number of vehicles in support of customer orders of Class 1 EV vans and Class 3 EV trucks and hurdled critical milestones of securing federal (\u2018NHTSA\u2019 and \u2018EPA\u2019) certification and IRS approval for tax credits. We completed a strategic purchase of EV battery pack manufacturing assets and showcased our innovations across the U.S. on the second leg of the 'Strikingly Different' Test Drive Tour. Mullen is accelerating toward a promising future, both on the road and in the market.\u201d\nFY2023 and Recent Highlights Include:\nMullen Class 1 and 3 Commercial Vehicles\nBollinger Motors - Oak Park, MichiganClass 4 \u2013 6 Commercial Vehicles | Bollinger B1 SUV and B2 Pick Up Truck\nMullen Consumer Vehicle Program - Irvine, CaliforniaMullen FIVE EV Crossover Program\nMullen-GO(TM)Mullen\u2019s urban commercial delivery vehicle, the Mullen-GO(TM) (\u201cMullen-GO\u201d), is designed to bridge the gap between the growing demand for quick deliveries and space constraints in dense cities throughout Europe.\nFullerton Battery Tech Assembly Facility\nSolid-State Polymer Battery Pack Update\nFollowing is a summary of key financial results for the twelve-months ended Sept. 30, 2023, and 2022. Shares of common stock issued and outstanding and additional paid-in capital have been adjusted retroactively to reflect all reverse stock splits.\nDuring fiscal 2023, the Company achieved the major milestone of bringing Mullen vehicles from development to production and sales. Mullen delivered 35 vehicles, generating a positive gross margin from sales to both dealer and end users. Revenue from 25 Campus Urban Delivery vehicle sales was $366.0 thousand for the twelve months ended Sept. 30, 2023. Cash payments from these sales was collected during the year ended Sept. 30, 2023.\nAt the end of fiscal 2023, the Company issued the first invoice for 10 Mullen THREE vehicles ($652.2 thousand) to a dealer and this revenue will be recognized upon the expiration of the return provision. The payment for this delivery was received in early October 2023.\nDuring the three months ended Dec. 31, 2023, the Company invoiced a dealer for an additional 231 Mullen THREE and Mullen ONE vehicles totaling $11.9 million. Mullen provides 30-day payment terms on vehicles delivered to its distributor Randy Marion.\n**Invoiced with 30 day payment terms to RMA\n\u201cIt was a year of significant headwinds in the equity market for electric vehicle manufactures with a majority seeing a significant decrease in market values during 2023. Mullen was no exception, and the decreased market value was the primary cause of NON-CASH write-downs of certain assets. We recorded $64.0 million of Bollinger goodwill impairment for twelve months ended Sept. 30, 2023, primarily due to unfavorable market conditions and the decline of market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. We recorded $14.8 million write-downs of property, plant and equipment and other non-current assets. We also recorded $5.9 million in intangible asset write-downs due to unfavorable market conditions and decline of the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock. This write-down was primarily for engineering designs for assets purchased out of the ELMS bankruptcy,\u201d said Jonathan New, chief financial officer of Mullen Automotive.\nFollowing are the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the twelve months ended Sept. 30, 2023, and 2022.\nThe net loss attributable to common stockholders after preferred dividends was $964.9 million, or $1,574.14 net loss per share, for the twelve months ended Sept. 30, 2023, as compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders after preferred dividends of $780.0 million, or $63,085.26 loss per share, for the twelve months ended Sept. 30, 2022.\nThere was $820.4 million and $687.8 million of\nincluded in the $1,006.7 million and $740.3 million net losses for the twelve months ended Sept. 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively per the detail below.\nSummary category totals from the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows for the years ended Sept. 30, 2023, and 2022 are presented below. Given the large amount of non-cash charges that occurred in 2023 and 2022, it is useful to review the combined operating activities and investing activities amounts from the cash flow report to understand the cash spent for 2023 and 2022. The Company spent a total of $287.1 million and $112.9 million in combined operating and investing activities for the twelve months ended Sept. 30, 2023, and 2022, respectively.\nIncluded in these numbers is $29.6 million, in 2022, to purchase Bollinger and $105.4 million, in 2022 and 2023, to purchase production assets rebranded as Mullen (Mullen ONE, Class 1 Urban Delivery EV van and the Mullen THREE, Class 3 Urban Utility EV truck) out of ELMS bankruptcy. The total cost of Bollinger acquisition was $148.5 million. In addition to the $29.6 million reported on the statement of cash flows, the Company issued common stock valued at $41.6 million and funded Bollinger with an additional $77.3 million in cash.\nFollowing are the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the twelve months ended Sept. 30, 2023, and 2022.\nAs of Sept. 30, 2023, the Company reported $155.7 million in cash, $16.8 million in inventory, $25.0 million in other current assets and $82.0 million in property, plant and equipment. Notes payable were $7.5 million on Sept. 30, 2023. This compares favorably to the end of fiscal 2022 when the Company had $84.4 million in cash, $2.0 million in other current assets, $14.8 million in property, plant and equipment and $9.0 million in notes payable.\nThe net working capital on Sept. 30, 2023, was positive and amounted to $58.5 million, or approximately $133.3 million after excluding derivative liabilities and liabilities to issue shares that are supposed to be settled by issuing common stock without using cash. This compares favorably to 2022 when working capital was ($35.9) million or $59.6 million after excluding derivative liabilities and liabilities to issue shares that are supposed to be settled by issuing common stock without using cash.\nFollowing are Consolidated Balance Sheets as of Sept. 30, 2023, and 2022.\nAbout Mullen\nMullen Automotive (NASDAQ: MULN) is a Southern California-based automotive company building the next generation of electric vehicles (\u201cEVs\u201d) that will be manufactured in its two United States-based assembly plants. Mullen's EV development portfolio includes the Mullen FIVE EV Crossover, Mullen-GO Commercial Urban Delivery EV, Mullen Commercial Class 1-3 EVs and Bollinger Motors, which features both the B1 and B2 electric SUV trucks and Class 4-6 commercial offerings.
