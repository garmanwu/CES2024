        "raw_content": "Archives\nCategories\nMeta\nMasterbuilt and Kamado Joe Reveal New Smokers, Connected Grills at CES 2024\nA few years ago, we bought a Masterbuilt smoker for the backyard. It\u2019s one of the higher-tech models with a companion app you can use the monitor and set the temperature remotely. This isn\u2019t the reason we chose it: what we loved is the hopper on the side that continuously feeds lump charcoal (or charcoal briquettes if you so prefer) into the fire. You could cook a brisket all day and not have to rush outside every hour to refuel and make sure to temperature is right.\nAt CES 2024, Middleby Outdoor, parent company to the Kamado Joe, Masterbuilt, and Char-Griller brands, was one of many companies in the barbecuing space to exhibit its latest products, all coming to market this year.\nThere are a few areas where Masterbuilt saw it could improve, and the company has done just that with the latest models. This includes more durable construction materials, better digital connected technology, and automatic fire starting.\nComing in February 2024 is the Masterbuilt AutoIgnite Series 545, which will sell for US$499. It features a QuickStart Auto-Ignition button and app-enabled monitoring and control. Fill up to four pounds of charcoal into the MiniHopper and let the grill\u2019s smart tech do the cooking for up to five hours.\nIt also includes a cast iron QuickSear hopper griddle plate, bottom storage, and an easy clean up system with fully removeable components. Masterbuilt says this model is for those who want the \u201cconvenience of gas grilling with the flavor of charcoal.\u201d\nThe new step-up model to the one I have (the Masterbuilt Gravity 560) is the Masterbuilt Gravity Series XT, which will be available in April 2024 and sell for a cool US$1,499. It\u2019s the largest and most advanced model in the line to date with a 1,260 square-inch grill and smoker. Like the existing model, it uses Wi-Fi and digital fan control to manage the GravityFed Hopper, which is large enough to hold enough fuel for up to 24 hours of controlled grill time.\nBut it now has an advanced control panel with graphing and alerts. The fuel saving hopper also provides more heat and moisture retention, delivering a 33% longer burn time than other Gravity Series grills, says the company.\nThe XT in the name doesn\u2019t just refer to the size: this grill is also extra tough, made with strengthened materials. It also has a fiberglass mesh gasket, U-shaped manifold to minimize flare ups, easy clean-up grease tray, and four full body stainless steel warming racks.\nFor those who prefer the egg-shaped design, there\u2019s the Kamado Joe Konnected Joe, which launched last year for US$1,699 and was also on display at the show. It\u2019s a digitally connected ceramic grill that blends the benefits of traditional ceramic cooking with modern technology.\nThe digital controls and app-enabled features help grillers experience the benefits of kamado cooking while making it easier to light the charcoal and maintain desired grill temperature.\nFOLLOW SOCIALS\nYou Might Also Enjoy\n\ufffcCanon Canada Appoints New President and CEO\nCanon Canada Inc. has appointed Mikio Takagi as President & ...\n\ufffcExpressVPN\u2019s Aircove Wi-Fi 6 Router With Built-in VPN is in Canada\nExpressVPN's first Wi-Fi 6 router with built-in VPN protection, the ...\nWhy I Swapped out Sonos for Bluesound\nThere\u2019s an old industry joke that says if you are ...\ncontact us\nJohn Thomson\n[email\u00a0protected]\nmobile: 416-726-3667\nChristine Persaud\n[email\u00a0protected]\nOur website uses cookies to improve your experience.

        "raw_content": "Masterbuilt Previews Two New Smart Charcoal Grills for 2024\nMuch like the new electric grill brand, Current Backyard, Masterbuilt is launching new smart grills this year at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). They gave a preview today of a new addition to the popular Gravity Series, and new charcoal grill that uses a similar technology in a conventional grilling format.\nOur Gravity Series grills have always been the leaders in digital charcoal cooking since the launch of the series in 2019 and through continuous improvement, we\u2019ve enhanced them with stronger, more rugged designs with several new Masterbuilt models for 2024. In addition, we continue to roll out the first fully digitally connected kamado grill, the Konnected Joe, after unveiling it to home cooks this past summer.\nMasterbuilt AutoIgnite Series 545\nThe Masterbuilt AutoIgnite Series 545 is a new design with familiar technology. It has a traditional grill look to it, but with all the technology that Masterbuilt has introduced in their other Gravity Series grills.\nIt\u2019s dubbed the AutoIgnite because to light the grill you load the hopper with charcoal, slide in a fire starter from the side, then press the ignite button. The internals look similar to their Gravity Series Portable where the hopper is inside the grill itself, attached to a manifold that stretches the length of the grill.\nLike the rest of Masterbuilt\u2019s charcoal grills, you can select the temperature of the grill on the controller that\u2019s built into the side shelf. It also interfaces with the Masterbuilt app to control and monitor your cook from anywhere.\nFeatures and Specs\nOne neat feature that\u2019s an improvement from the Gravity Series Portable is the top of the charcoal hopper isn\u2019t just wasted space anymore. It\u2019s made out of cast iron, so you can use it for quick, high heat searing.\nMasterbuilt Gravity Series XT\nThe popular Gravity Series gets a new top of range model with the Gravity Series XT. The letters XT stand for \u201cextra tough\u201d construction. It includes strengthened areas, such as a fiberglass mesh gasket, and a new U-shaped manifold to minimize flare ups. That\u2019s welcome improvement, because the other Gravity Series models were definitely more prone to flare ups in our testing.\nThe XT has a new controller that will look familiar, because it\u2019s shares with the Konnected Joe. It has a better quality feel to it that other Gravity Series controllers and has more advanced features like temperature mapping. Like the other models, you can set the temperature you want on the controller, or control it with the Masterbuilt app.\nFeatures and Specs\nOne other improvement from previous Gravity Series grills is the shutdown slides are now integrated. Before you had to pull the two slides out to start the grill, then put them back in place to shut it down. The new design has a lever that you slide into place, which is a cleaner way to do it.\nConclusion\nWe\u2019re big fans of the Gravity Series line, so we\u2019re excited to see it expand. As we noted in our review, it gives pellet grill levels of convenience with more smoke flavor. These new grills add a unique take with the AutoIgnite and an expansion on the top of the model range with the XT.\nVista Outdoor Company Revelyst Announces Chief HR Officer\nBrisk It Completely Innovates Smoke and Searing on a Pellet Grill\nWeber Launches New Portable Grills \u2013 Q+, Traveler Compact, Griddle\nAaron Franklin on His New Book for Home BBQ Cooks \u2013 Franklin Smoke\nPit Boss Griddle vs Blackstone Griddle in 2023\nChar-Broil\u2019s Parent Company Acquires Dansons \u2013 Pit Boss, Louisiana Grills\nSolo Stove Fire Pit Surround is Our Favorite Accessory\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nFOLLOW US\n\u00a9 Newspaper WordPress Theme by TagDiv"

Pitmaster Christie Vanover shares her thoughts on what was shown.\nThis past week was a little hectic, but also full of adventure. I started it off at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. I\u2019m going to touch on some of that today.\nThen I had a great meeting with some top women in barbecue. We\u2019ve got some fun things planned for the future.\nAnd then I finished the week off with a competition in Bullhead City, Arizona. Team Girls Can Grill finished 11th overall.\nListen to the BBQ Tips Podcast on\nTable of Contents\nIn this week\u2019s podcast, I\u2019m going to touch on artificial intelligence and grilling. You know, it\u2019s really interesting because when you think of grilling and barbecue, it\u2019s such a primitive experience.\nYou need fire, you know, some kind of fuel source and fire \u2013 I touched on this last week \u2013 and your food. That\u2019s all you really need.\nYou don\u2019t need artificial intelligence, but artificial intelligence, technology, automation, that is really starting to take over in our world. So the grilling companies out there are trying to find ways to make grilling easier for you.\nUsually CES or the Consumer Electronics Show is really tailored around big brands and technology. But this year, there were six grill companies who showed up to show what automations they\u2019re adding to their grills.\nSeergrills Perfecta Grill\nI\u2019m going to start with the Seergrills, because it was one of the most interesting grills that I saw out there. It was definitely unique, innovative and different from many of the girls that I\u2019ve ever seen before.\nThe Seergrills company launched The Perfecta Grill. The Perfecta Grill is a cube that you set outdoors. It is an outdoor grill, but it cooks your food vertically.\nIt was super fascinating. So they had this vertical chamber that was spring loaded. You load your meat in it\nOnce you put the chamber into the grill, you use the touch screen digital display and select what you\u2019re cooking.\nThen the grill burns at 1,652F degrees. I mean, it is flaming hot. It has these two burners on the side and they adjust. This is where the artificial intelligence comes in. They adjust based on what you\u2019re cooking.\nSo it knows if you\u2019re cooking a steak and you want it medium rare, how often it needs to have those burners on. And then it kind of pulses them in and out, depending on your cook time.\nThe other thing that this grill does is it can cook pizzas. So pizzas, obviously, you can\u2019t cook vertically or all the toppings would slide off. So the way that works is you take out the chamber that the steak would normally go into.\nYou place your pizza peel in the bottom. You turn the grill on. That heats up that metal plate so that when you place your pizza on it, the heat from that metal plate is actually going to cook your pizza dough.\nThen, you program it for pizza and those 1,652-degree burners will pulse on and off just enough to melt the cheese and to crisp up your toppings.\nThey claim they can cook ribeyes in 90 seconds, so that\u2019s pretty impressive.\nI will say the price point is really high. It\u2019s $3,500.\nIt\u2019s really sleek. It would look really pretty on a backyard patio. And you\u2019d definitely give a show. I mean, a lot of the people at CES 2024 were super impressed by the technology and it was just something that was really fancy that people like to look at.\nSo if you want to put on a show and you\u2019ve got that kind of dough, then it\u2019s definitely something that you may want to consider.\nCurrent Backyard Electric Grill\nAnother company that made its debut at CES 2024, is Current Backyard.\nThe Current Backyard Electric grill is similar in height and size to a standard gas grill, but it\u2019s not fueled by gas. It\u2019s actually fueled by electricity. So you plug it into the wall and then there are two burners that are infrared burners.\nSo once you plug this in, you just turn the dial and you can control the heat intensity of each burner.\nThe maximum temperature is 700F degrees, so you could get a really nice sear on this.\nIn addition to controlling the grill from the front panel, you can also download the app for your phone and control the grill temperature.\nFrom there, you can turn the burners on and off. You can adjust the heat level. You can even use the internal thermometers that the grill comes with to monitor the temperature of your meat so that you can be somewhere else in your house looking at the app and figuring out how close your meat is to being ready.\nI think the concept of the Current Backyard Electric Grill is really interesting, especially for those who aren\u2019t allowed to have charcoal grills in their apartments or maybe in the county that they live in.\nThe price tag is around $900. So if you\u2019re looking for an electric grill, it might be something worth considering.\nBefore I move on to some of my favorite grills that were on display at CES 2024, I want to touch on my least favorite.\nBrisk It NeoSear with InnoGrill AI\nThere was a grill company there called Brisk It.\nTo me, the technology was the same technology I see in all pellet grills, whether it\u2019s a Recteq or a Traeger or a GMG.\nYou basically set the temperature of your grill. There\u2019s an internal thermometer and it\u2019s going to feed pellets and feed heat based on the internal temperature of your grill. It will automatically adjust the fan or adjust the auger for how many pellets are dropped in to control the heat of your grill.\nSo I don\u2019t see anything really earth shattering or groundbreaking about that.\nThey did have a newer grill on display that isn\u2019t out yet.\nIt has an electric heat source, so it has a burner in the bottom similar to the Current Backyard grill, but it does have the addition of pellets to add that pellet smoke flavor.\nIt has a similar automation that you\u2019re going to get with a pellet grill. But where it said that it was unique and this is the AI and automation that it was introducing to the show was with their app and with their InnoGrill technology.\nThey said that you would be able to download the app and type in that you want to cook grilled chicken. You would give some basic details, maybe some ingredients that you have in your pantry, and the artificial intelligence would create the recipe for you.\nSo then it would tell you season your meat, heat your grill to the certain temperature and you would click to go to the next steps.\nYou add your your meat to the grill. It would tell you if you need to spritz your meat or if it\u2019s time to wrap your meat and when your meat is done.\nAll of that sounds promising, but where I didn\u2019t like this grill is the artificial intelligence, to me, wasn\u2019t quite there yet. Now, they claim that they\u2019re creating their own AI and that their team is actually developing the recipes and the coding to create the recipes.\nBut I went ahead and downloaded the app. I looked at the recipes it generated.\nIt said that beef ribs, like those dino ribs, would take 11 hours. That\u2019s a long time. I cook my dino ribs in 5 to 6 hours.\nIt said that a flank steak should be smoked in about 2 1/2 to 3 hours. That too is a really long time. You\u2019re going to end up with some beef jerky.\nSo I don\u2019t think the AI technology is there, and what concerns me the most about this is that if you were to buy this grill and use this technology and you bought your brisket or you bought your meat and you followed all the instructions and put it on the grill and your meat didn\u2019t turn out great, you\u2019re going to maybe think that you\u2019re not a good griller if you followed all the instructions that maybe you didn\u2019t do something right.\nWhen in fact, it\u2019s actually the AI technology not really giving you the best guidance.\nInstead, you should trust people like Girls can Grill or other great websites that actually have humans developing recipes where we know that we\u2019ve tested them.\nWe know that their tried and true instead of just some automated information that may or may not be the most accurate information.\nLet\u2019s move on to some of my favorite grills.\nKamado Joe Konnected Joe\nMasterbuilt and Kamado shared a tent, and they were there with their newest lineup. They had the Kamado Joe Konnected, which is a grill that I already have.\nIt\u2019s a charcoal ceramic egg, but it has the technology to make it so easy to cook on.\nThere\u2019s a burner in the bottom of the grill, so all you have to do is add your coals and plug it in. You can push the button and that burner will heat up and actually light your coals for you so you don\u2019t even have to worry about lighting them.\nThen, you set the temperature and it will tell you exactly how to set the upper vent and the lower vent, and it will automatically control the temperature of the grill for you.\nI\u2019ve cooked on the Konnected Joe. I\u2019m really pleased with the results. Super easy to light, super easy to maintain heat and if you still want to do the manual controls, you can do that too.\nYou don\u2019t have to use the automatic controls, but they\u2019re there if you want them and it does have an app. So again, you can monitor your cook time, your cook temperatures, your meat temperatures, etc., all from your phone.\nMasterbuilt XT and AutoIgnite\nMasterbuilt also showed off a couple of their automated grills. I have the Masterbuilt 1050, which is a gravity-fed grill, which is charcoal and also runs like a pellet grill.\nWell, they have a new one that\u2019s called XT which stands for Extra Tough.\nThis one is a little bit larger in capacity, a couple hundred more square inches, but they\u2019ve really made some improvements that I like compared to the 1050.\nSo with the 1050, there are two plates that you have to pull out. When you start your grill. There\u2019s a big charcoal hopper that holds your lump charcoal or your charcoal briquettes.\nYou remove those plates, and that allows the oxygen to circle in to heat the charcoal up, and then also to allow the heat to go into the chamber.\nWell, I have started my grill without removing those plates and realized 15 minutes later that my grill didn\u2019t ignite because there was no oxygen going into the chamber.\nWith the XT, you don\u2019t have those plates anymore. Instead, there\u2019s just kind of this toggle that you move, and that opens things up so that the oxygen can feed through. And the digital panel tells you that you need to do that so you don\u2019t forget.\nAnother change that they made with the Masterbuilt XT is that the manifold is now U-shaped, so that\u2019s supposed to help with flare ups.\nAnd then another thing that I like is that now there\u2019s a pause button.\nSo because this charcoal grill operates kind of similar to a pellet grill, you\u2019ve got a temperature probe inside the grill. When you open the lid, you\u2019re introducing cooler air. So that temperature probe is trying to tell the fan, \u201cHey, we got to feed more air to this fire to get it going because the temperature is dropping.\u201d\nWell, now you can push the dial, and there\u2019s a pause button. So it pauses this temperature probe and tells it, \u201cHey, don\u2019t pay attention to the air right now. Just keep doing what you\u2019re doing. Let the grill keep running.\u201d And then once you close your lid, you press that unpause button and then basically everything goes back to normal.\nSo that\u2019s a really great addition that they\u2019ve made to that. Again, larger space, less flare ups, bigger hopper and then a couple of adjustments to how the grill works.\nPlus, it has that app technology.\nMasterbuilt AutoIgnite\nThe other Masterbuilt that I\u2019m really intrigued about is the AutoIgnite.\nIt\u2019s again about the height and the size of a gas grill, but it\u2019s charcoal.\nWhat makes it unique is that you have your grill grate and then there\u2019s actually a hopper or a charcoal box that\u2019s inside on the right side of the grill itself. You fill your charcoal in there.\nThey say it should last about eight hours. You put the lid on top, and the lid is metal and you can actually sear on it because it gets really hot. So you have kind of a sear station or a little griddle that you can use.\nThen, the rest of the grill grate is just like a regular grill.\nSimilar to the Masterbuilt XT or to a pellet grill, the Masterbuilt AutoIgnite also has a temperature probe inside the grill that\u2019s going to communicate with the fan.\nSo I\u2019ve never actually seen a charcoal grill this size with this automation.\nIt\u2019s a nice back patio size where you get charcoal and you get automation. So I was really impressed with that, especially since it\u2019s only at a $500 price point.\nGE Profile Indoor Smoker\nI think the most revolutionary grill of the show was from GE. Their GE Profile Indoor Smoker was definitely something that I\u2019ve never seen before.\nIt looks like a vertical microwave, and then it has multiple levels where you can adjust the height. So you can fit a whole pork butt. You can fit a whole chicken or 40 chicken wings or even three racks of ribs that you cut in half.\nSo this is an electric smoker. You\u2019re going to plug it in and it\u2019s the electricity that\u2019s going to create the heat.\nThe pellets are not actually burning to create heat. They\u2019re just burning to create flavor.\nYou add two cups of pellets in the top of the smoker, and there\u2019s actually a little drawer that you pull out and you add water in that in the bottom of the smoker.\nOnce you set your grill and you set your temperature, the electricity is going to control the heat level inside the grill and then the pellets are going to smolder and they\u2019re going to start to smoke.\nThat smoke gets fed into the chamber of the grill, and then the pellets, once they\u2019ve burned a little bit, are going to drop into that drawer of water. And that\u2019s what extinguishes them.\nSo you don\u2019t get the smoke inside the house from that. Then all the smoke inside the chamber actually flavors your meat and then it kind of gets sucked out to the back of the grill where it goes through a like catalytic converter type of process, or in other words, it just gets filtered.\nSo it cleans out that smoke so that any air that comes out of the grill is actually clean and not toxic for you so that you can cook with it indoors.\nAs far as the cooking process, there\u2019s a digital control panel.\nYou can choose the meat that you\u2019re cooking; you can choose the doneness that you want. There are internal thermometer probes that you can put into your meat, and it will monitor it and tell you how your meat\u2019s coming along and how much time is left.\nThere\u2019s also an app for this grill.\nThe price point for the GE profile indoor smoker is about $1,000 and it\u2019s already available.\nBut I have to tell you, one of my favorite features about this grill, despite the fact that it\u2019s pretty innovative and cool that you can smoke indoors, is the fact that the temperature goes down to 140F degrees.\nThe reason that\u2019s important is because that is the safe temperature for holding food.\nYou can literally be laying in bed, get a notification on your phone that your brisket is ready. Then, use the app to adjust the temperature of the smoker to 140F degrees to turn it into a holding cabinet.\nSo that\u2019s one of the features that I love the best.\nWeber Grills\nThere was another grill company that you may have read was at CES 2024 but they weren\u2019t actually at CES. So Weber did come to Las Vegas during the CES show, but they didn\u2019t sign up as an exhibitor.\nI wasn\u2019t able to go in and actually see all the new products that they were launching. Instead, they had a private event that was in another location in Las Vegas where they demonstrated some of their lineup.\nYou might be able to read about those different products, but unfortunately, as a CES media attendee, I wasn\u2019t able to see those.\nSo that\u2019s the lineup of grills that was at CES 2024.\nI hope you guys enjoyed this week\u2019s podcast. It was a little unique. We got to see some of the new trends in grilling related to automation and artificial intelligence.\nI have another barbecue competition coming up this weekend. The Nevada Barbecue Association is putting together game on. We\u2019re going to get a mystery box of ingredients. And it\u2019s all going to be wild game. It should be pretty fun. I\u2019m also headed to the fancy food show in Las Vegas this next week.\nSo there\u2019s going to be a lot of specialty food items on display.

        "raw_content": "Kamado Joe's new ceramic grill has built-in smart features and one-button ignition\nThe Konnected Joe is a true ceramic grill with two big upgrades.\nCeramic kamado-style grills have been some of the best grilling gear available for backyard cooks for a long time. However, it takes practice to master lighting them and maintaining proper temperatures. Kamado Joe aims to get rid of those frustrations with its latest smart grill. The Konnected Joe is equipped with a push-button charcoal igniter and a digitally controlled fan system. The former gets the grill going and while the latter keeps the heat level where you need it.\nThe Konnected Joe is a true kamado grill at its core. The ceramic chamber has trademark Kamado Joe design features like an Air Lift hinge that raises the lid with ease, two-tier cooking inside, side shelves and a slide-out ash drawer for quick cleaning. The 18-inch diameter cooking surface offers 250 square inches of grilling space. The company says this is enough room for 13 burgers, four whole chickens or two pork butts. In the bottom of the cooking chamber, Kamado Joe has added a so-called Automatic Fire Starter that ignites charcoal with a simple button press. The company says this tool can have your grill ready to use in less than 15 minutes.\nThe smart grilling features center around Kamado Joe's Kontrol System. This setup includes the Kontrol Board digital display, the Kontrol Fan that maintains temperature and the Kontrol Tower vent up top. The entire system is controlled from the Kamado Joe app where you can adjust and monitor grill temps, keep tabs on food temperatures (up to three probes at once) and check in on cook times. Plus, you can do all of this without being near the grill. The Konnected Joe has a temperature range of 200-700 degrees Fahrenheit, so you can expect to do low-and-slow smoking, high-heat searing and everything in between. An Automatic Cook Mode puts step-by-step guidance on the grill's display and a Classic Cook Mode allows you to do everything manually.\nThe Konnected Joe is $1,699, $300 less than the WiFi-equipped Pellet Joe that debuted in 2020. Pre-orders start today at the company's website, The Home Depot and other retailers. Kamado Joe says the grill will begin shipping in June."

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.
