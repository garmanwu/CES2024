        "raw_content": "Dongguan transforms from world factory to technology hub\nDongguan has vowed to take scientific and technological innovation as its engine to drive the city's advanced manufacturing industry, becoming a brand-new blueprint for the future of the \"world factory\".\nDongguan, dubbed the \"factory of the world,\" in South China's Guangdong province, has witnessed huge changes in its upgraded industry distribution.\nPreviously, it heavily relied on low-margin processing trade and labor-intensive industries.\nNowadays, the traditional best-sellers in Dongguan's foreign trade, including clothing, shoes and hats, have been replaced by high value-added products such as smartphones, mechanical and electrical products that now account for more than 80 percent of Dongguan's total export value.\nThe founder of Dongguan's Yutong Optical Technology Co Ltd, or YTOT, was experienced in manufacturing optical lens in China. Last year, the professional optical lenses manufacturer's investment in R&D has increased year by year. In 2021, the total expenditure on R&D was 134 million yuan ($20.1 million), more than double the investment in 2020.\nWith a deep understanding of \"quality\" as the core competitiveness of enterprises in market competition, Yutong Optics insists on independent innovation and research and development and is committed to becoming the industry leader in producing optical lens.\nOver the past two decades, Edifier has grown from a small team of audio enthusiasts to an internationally recognized leader in audio solutions. Edifier products are now enjoyed by customers from over 70 countries and regions.\n\"We believe one thing: a passion for sound. Through research and innovation, we seek a bod design that\u2019s also intuitive to use\", said Li Xiaodong, secretary of the Board of Directors and vice general manager of Edifier.\nLi said that Edifier is also committed to creating a responsible business and giving back to the society. \"We help children with hearing impairments discover the magic of music, support young talents with scholarships and find innovative ways to protect the environment.\"\nDongguan's high-end manufacturing industry grew rapidly. In 2022, the spending on R&D in Dongguan accounted for 4.0 percent of its GDP. At present, there are 9,099 state-level high-tech enterprises in Dongguan, and the number is still growing in recent years.\nDongguan has promoted the digital transformation of over 5,100 industrial enterprises and driven 45,000 companies to move to the cloud. The industrial software and information industry in the city has grown by 118%, and the cluster of the intelligent mobile terminal industry has smoothly passed the national acceptance.\nBy the end of 2022, 42 industrial companies with a total registered capital of 350 million yuan ($54.8 million) have been incubated and established by the Songshan Lake Materials Laboratory, jointly built by the municipal government and a renowned research institute in China. Among them, 6 have been recognized as national high-tech enterprises.\nSongshan Lake Science City, where the joint lab is located, is planned to be built as a pilot area of a comprehensive national science center in the Greater Bay Area.\nThe lab is committed to studies on advanced science and the combination of science resources and local industrial development, which is expected to help the \"world factory\" further innovate and upgrade its industrial forms in the new era.\nCopyright 1995 -\n.

This was\u00c2\u00a0the first time for Disheng to participate in the CES exhibition, and was also the first time to participate in an\u00c2\u00a0exhibition in the United States. Therefore, this exhibition is an important opportunity for Disheng\u00c2\u00a0to go deep into the US market.\nIn order to acquire new customers, the team members comprise of senior executives of our\u00c2\u00a0company, and are directly led by the general manager and deputy general manager. There is no doubt that they have extensive knowledge of the\u00c2\u00a0factory and products, and they are\u00c2\u00a0more convincingly introduce core competence\u00c2\u00a0on\u00c2\u00a0our production, product research and development which attracts visitors in many aspects. During the exhibition, our participants were able to chat smoothly with customers, and the topics continued to amuse each other, creating a natural and harmonious atmosphere. Moreover, they were\u00c2\u00a0neither humble nor overbearing. When facing customers, they took\u00c2\u00a0the initiative to ask many questions to them in order to better understand the other company and its market conditions, so as to provide customers with reasonable products and price plans.\nDongguan Disheng Technology Electronic Co., Ltd was founded in 2016 and has been specializing in all kinds of smartphone screen protectors and mobile phone accessories such as chargers and cables. At CES\u00c2\u00a02023, Disheng mainly showed our iPhone 14 series\u00c2\u00a0of tempered film and chargers with a variety of power options\u00c2\u00a0to customers. Moreover, our exhibitors even bought the exhibition\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s\u00c2\u00a0samples at a discount. The scene was once hot, and there was an endless stream of people coming and going. This not only attracts more people to pay attention to us and shortens the distance between each other, but also allows potential customers in the crowd to further understand the use of our products. In addition, this kind of activity can also reflect the interests and usage tendencies of customers, and help us better understand product market trends. The effect of this exhibition is very ideal, which is very meaningful and beneficial to us, so Disheng\u00c2\u00a0has gotten\u00c2\u00a0the same booth - No.\u00c2\u00a053771\u00c2\u00a0in 2024. We look forward to meeting new and old friends here again in January next year.\nIn a sense, what we sell is not a product but a factory. Disheng's current main business is OEM and ODM.\u00c2\u00a0In order\u00c2\u00a0to provide\u00c2\u00a0more people with OEM/ ODM service, we want to let more foreign\u00c2\u00a0partners know us. Through the exhibition,\u00c2\u00a0we hope that they can understand the strength of our factory in terms of management, products, certificates, etc. Exhibiting our flagship products in many countries and places is the most effective means under the current circumstances.
