You can\u2019t fix stupid\nOn Dec 11th, 2021 Evelyn Hayman said\nWe attend the Hickory Gun show and it\u2019s well worth the trip and the entry fee. Lots of vendors and prices aren\u2019t that bad either . Will be attending all events for 2022!\nOn Jun 29th, 2019 Mr. Willis said\nBeen going for 20 years. This has always been a great gun show. Ive been to several that were bigger but for variety hickory is always a good place to go. Aside from the usual booths there are usually nfa vendors, great miltaria collectiables, and antinque guns around. Where else can you buy pinfire revolvers and a 50 cal or 6.5 marksmanship rifles at the same show?\nOn Nov 2nd, 2017 Keith S said\nI\u2019ve been going for years. All I can say is, if you cant find it, you were not looking !\nOn Jul 21st, 2017 Michael Whitener said\nHey! I like it. It\u2019s my belief is if you can find one better go to it don\u2019t complain about your decision.\nOn Nov 4th, 2016 Don Vance said\nThis gun show is one of the best in this region. The vendors are all good folks. Besides guns, you can expect to see a variety of knives, along with other survival gear. If you are serious about what\u2019s going on America, then you will want to attend this show to see what\u2019s missing from your preparedness kit.\nOn Nov 4th, 2016 Randy G said\nI\u2019ve been to all the Hickory Shows for the last 2 years .. I\u2019m a recently moved from Connecticut .. you folks who think the Hickory isn\u2019t worth going to should take it from me .. IT\u2019S GREAT ! Yes, I\u2019ve been to Charlotte and it\u2019s bigger but what is available for the buying public here in this state whether the show is big or small should be appreciated. I\u2019ll continue to support the promoters by going .. till I\u2019m too old to walk.\nOn Oct 28th, 2016 John Aronis said\nI have enjoyed the gun shows in Hickory thanks\nOn Jan 26th, 2016 Bill said\nThe Hickory gun show is not worth it . Even if you manage to print of the dollar coupon, it\u2019s still not worth paying eight dollars to go.\nOn May 9th, 2021 Tricia said\nTotally disagree with this comment.
