        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

The total count of e-bike sales now even outnumber EV car sales worldwide, so that growth trend continues. Some 85% of all bikes sold in China are now e-bikes.\ne-bikes\nThis single category continues to grow in revenue and units shipped, so CES is a popular place to show off the latest in bikes with electric motors, powered by batteries to ease some of the manual peddling burden for commuters, mountain bikers, and cargo bikes.\nTopsecret\nAn urban e-bike with no hubs on the wheels.\nVanpowers\nThey showed two e-bike styles this year, and have features like: hub motor lock, emergency SOS, vibration detector, real-time GPS tracking, and geofencing.\nKugoo\nAn off-road, full suspension e-bike from a vendor that also has e-scooters.\nUltima\nFrom France with have several e-bikes aimed at commuters.\nURTOPIA\nA CES 2024 Innovation Award honoree offering four models: Carbon 1s, Carbon 1, Chord, Chord X, Fusion. The carbon frames are unique in that the seat tube doesn\u2019t directly connect to the bottom bracket, rather it\u2019s merged with the seat stays. Carbon is used for the belt-drive, instead of a steel chain, and there\u2019s a built-in display in the stem that even works with Google Maps, Apple Health and Strava, wow. ChatGPT works through Bluetooth to your phone, and there\u2019s also WiFi and GPS. Their e-bike is activated by a ring.\nHimiway\nPlenty of segmentation with eight e-bikes: The C1 (kids), C3 (cargo), C5 (motorbike), D5 Pro (off road), D7 Pro (extreme off road), A7 Pro (commuter), X5 Pro (carbon), and X5 Ultra (carbon mountain bike).\nHeybike\nNew for this year is the Hauler model, a cargo e-bike, adding to their line of over a dozen models to choose from.\nCyrusher\nWith almost a dozen e-bike models to choose from, one model that stands out is their fat-tire electric bike.\nRictor\nBlurring the lines between bike and motorcycle is the K1, as it sports motorcycle tires and shocks, but then adds pedals like an e-bike.\nVinFast\nWith the motor in the rear hub, this DragonFly almost looks like a mini-bike, instead of an e-bike.\nKorea Mobility\nThe KOMO hub-less e-bike from Korea looks like another commuter choice, and they are a 2024 CES Innovation Award honoree.\nAIMA\nAn aluminum frame mountain bike with front suspension and disc brakes was shown.\nHYPER Bike Company\nOne of the few brands that offers both traditional bikes and e-bikes, with 14 models of e-bikes to choose from, mostly commuter and fat-tire e-bikes.\nDaewon J&B\nThis South Korean company has some sketchy plans for a hub-less e-bike, so let\u2019s wait for a real product to emerge. The look reminds me of the movie Tron from years ago.\nMileBox\nFrom Canada comes a cargo e-bike for carrying big loads, along with software to manage a fleet of delivery vehicles.\nVery cool sustainable tech product called #milebox , a cargo e-bike for commercial last mile delivery #ces #ces2024 pic.twitter.com/KhuPv0quul\n\u2014 brostocksmedia (@brostocksmedia) January 10, 2024\nMovcan\nThis Chinese company has two off-road e-bikes, the V20 and V30, both looking like a cross between a moped and a motorcycle. Manufactured by Dongguan Shiwei Technology.\nSaneagle\nWith 18 models of e-bikes, this Chinese company has products for: city, commuter, fat cruiser, road, mountain.\nGreenworks\nThis Tennessee-based company produces products in multiple categories, and they field five e-bikes for off-road and commuting.\nMileBox\nFrom Canada comes a startup that provides an e-bike for hauling cargo, along with the logistics for fleet management of deliveries.\nYeScooter\nWith eight e-bikes to choose from, this Chinese company also offers scooters.\nOwlet\nThere are no pedals on this e-bike fro California, and the tube design is unlike any other bike on the road.\nKixin\nOffering three models of e-bikes, this Chinese company has integrated a display for their bikes.\nKingSong\nA hub-powered e-bike with mid-frame suspension, and adjustable height stem and seat.\nSmilee\nThirteen models of e-bikes are offered by this vendor, and they have aluminum frames.\nYadea\nTwo e-bike models with suspension, motorcycle light and fat tires.\nYK Chic\nThree models of fat-tire e-bikes hail from this Chinese vendor.\nKopuway\nA range of off-road, full-suspension e-bikes, made in China.\nSegway\nThe name made famous by self-balancing two-wheel mobility, now has a new e-bike called Xafari.\nVolta\nHow about a cruiser e-bike from VTA, they mostly offer scooters.\nFUELL\nThis step-through e-bike called the Flluid-3 touts a long range battery, suspension, fenders and a rack.\nTrainers\nI\u2019ve used indoor trainers from both Wahoo and Garmin (Tacx), where you remove the rear wheel and attach the bike to a smart trainer, then use a fitness app like Zwift to ride virtual courses.\nULTIRACER NEO\nYour bike rides on rollers, while being supported by the frame so that you don\u2019t tip over at slow speeds. This produce was a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Digital Health category. I first used rollers in the 1970s, and there is a learning curve to stay balanced, especially at slow speeds. Once you get the hang of it, then you steer to keep on track.\nIt looks like this system has it\u2019s own software, but I\u2019ve never seen it for sale in any of my online or retail bike stores yet.\nSunny\nIt looks like a Peloton, yet this company offers 60 models of exercise bikes.\nLifeSpan\nThe Ampera is a seat with pedals for desk workers that can charge your devices through a USB-C port or a 15W Qi charging plate, so not something that you put on gym clothes for a workout, rather something used in home and office for light exercise.\nSmart Accessories\nVelo.ai\nCoPilot is an AI-powered bike light and camera designed to keep cyclists safer on the road.\nLivall Helmets\nCommuters will be seen with the Smart Commuter helmet, as the rear light is higher up and more visible to motorists.\nIn Charge\nWhere are you going to charge your e-bike? That\u2019s where In Charge comes in, as they are building up an EV charger network for e-bikes and scooters.\nWiPowerOne\nWireless charging for e-cargo bikes, that\u2019s what this Chinese company has developed.\nGarmin\nWomen can use the new HR-Fit, it\u2019s a heart rate monitor that fits onto medium and high-support sports bras. I sure hope that swapping batteries doesn\u2019t require using a miniature Torx screwdriver like on previous models, as the threads tend to strip out.\nSennheiser\nEarbuds that also track heart rate and body temperature, OK, that\u2019s unique, but I recommend that cyclists not be distracted with earbuds while on the road for safety reasons.\nMindMics\nSimilar to Garmin, MindMics has an earbud with heart rate monitoring feature, plus they are a CES 2024 Innovation Awards honoree.\nSafeware\nModern cars have airbags and they save many lives, so why not do something similar for cyclists? Safeware has a wearable airbag that looks like a vest, and they are a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree.\nQualcomm\nThe Snapdragon Digital Chassis SoCs give e-bikes connectivity, infotainment, advanced rider assistances systems (ARAS) and personalized cloud-connected digital services.\nValeo\nPlacing both the electric motor and gears inside the same gearbox is what the Cyclee from Valeo does, so no more derailleurs for an e-bike.\nBosch\nThe electric motor is central to all e-bikes, and that is where Bosch comes in, as they sell the drivetrain to e-bike companies, like: Riese & Muller, Gazelle, Trek, and Tern.\u00a0 Editors at Wired did test rides outside of several e-bikes at Red Rocks Canyon National Conservation Area.\nSummary\nI still ride a traditional road bike, however more of my buddies are buying e-bikes for their spouses and parents. As I cycle around the Portland, Oregon area I\u2019m seeing more e-bikes in all flavors: commuter, fat-tire, mountain, road, cargo. The e-bike revolution just keeps growing, with all of the traditional bike brands (Specialized, Trek, Cannondale, Fuji, Canyon) adding electric models, and new entrants emerge that have no bike history.\nFollow my cycling adventures on Strava, or in virtual reality on Zwift (Daniel Payne, 66), better yet, let\u2019s go for a ride together.\nRelated Blogs\nCES 2023 and all things cycling\nCES 2022 and the Electrification of Cycling\nCES 2021 and all things Cycling Technology\nComments\nOne Reply to \u201cCES 2024 and all things Cycling\u201d\nYou must register or log in to view/post comments.\nPost navigation\nTrending Now\nIEDM 2023 \u2013 Imec CFET\nWEBINAR: Mastering DC-DC Converters: Your Guide to Better Hardware\nCryogenic Semiconductor Designs for Quantum Computing\nHow Disruptive will Chiplets be for Intel and TSMC?\nHow Codasip Unleashed CHERI and Created a Paradigm Shift for Secured Innovation\nRecent Forum Threads\nASML 2023 Earnings Call Discussion\nChina Buys Near-Record $40 Billion of Chip Gear to Beat US Curbs\nTSMC 2024 Investor Meeting Discussion\nSamsung, SK to spend $471 billion on 'world's largest chip cluster'\nThermal impact from BSPDN\nAltman Seeks to Raise Billions for Network of AI Chip Factories\nSAMSUNG\u2019S 2ND-GEN 3NM PROCESS, SF3, HAS BEGUN TRIAL PRODUCTION\nS.

        "raw_content": "Dominion Energy admits it can't meet data center power demands in Virginia\nThe high-voltage lines simply can't handle more power, says the utility\nNorth American utility Dominion Energy says it may not be able to meet demands for power in Ashburn, Northern Virginia, delaying building projects in the world's fastest-growing data center hub by many years.\nDominion has told customers that it has power supplies, but can no longer guarantee to deliver the quantity of electricity customers want via overhead powerlines. If these warnings prove true, this could stall projects with billions invested, and Loudoun County's tax revenue would take a severe hit if the hub of data centers in Ashburn stalls. For now, local authorities and industry bodies are struggling to understand the sudden warning from Dominion.\nDominion supplies electricity in Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, as well as natural gas to parts of the US. In the data center-rich counties of Loudoun, Prince William, and Fauquier, most of the electricity is carried by overhead powerlines marching along roads - a delivery method that has led to protests.\nLoudoun County has 26 million square feet of data center space, with 5 million more in development and many more projects planned. Data center equipment taxes provide one-third of the County's tax income, but has recently faced a backlash from residents who want fewer facilities built.\nNow they may get their wish - and may suffer from a lack of funds to the County coffers in the process.\nWells Fargo warning\nDominion could halt power delivery for new data center developments until 2025 or 2026, according to a warning that emerged in a note from Wells Fargo analysts to clients this week. Facilities which are only three to six months from completion should get their power, said the note, but any further from completion might face \"significant delays.\"\n\"The issue stems not from a lack of power generation capabilities, but rather, an inability to distribute over high-voltage power lines to Ashburn,\" said the Wells Fargo note, which DCD has seen. Even if developers have a commitment letter from the utility, they might still not get their power, says Wells Fargo.\nThe analysts' note was quickly confirmed by industry sources, including company earnings calls. Digital Realty's aptly-named CFO Andy Power told analysts yesterday that Dominion had warned Digital of a \"potential pinch point in Eastern Loudoun County that could delay deliveries until 2026,\u201d adding that the cause was \"transmission, not generation, i.e. the pipes or the power line infrastructure, not the actual power.\"\nWells Fargo predicts that data center construction planned for 2023/2024 could be \"significantly delayed,\" which would derail 90MW of hyperscale data center commitments, along with more leases planned for years to come.\nDigital's Power said there would be \"a slowdown in delivery of new supply in the largest and most consistently in-demand data center market in the world.\u201d\nPrince William will benefit\nThe Wells Fargo note predicts that data center projects affected by the overload in Loudoun will move to neighboring counties: \"We would envision that Prince William County could be a major beneficiary of new deployments moving away from Ashburn. Multiple companies, including CloudHQ, Stack Infrastructure, and Iron Mountain, have meaningful exposure to Prince William County. This development could also be a boon for Quantum Loophole, a developer that is building a 1GW hyperscale campus in nearby Maryland.\"\nDevelopers, operators, and local authorities are expressing frustration with Dominion's communication of the issue.\n\u201cThe power company did not give definitive answers to most of the relevant questions we have,\" said Power, \"but they have been transparent about the potential issue, and they\u2019re working very diligently to finalize their assessment.\"\nIndustry group the Data Center Coalition expressed concern. Its president Josh Levi said: \u201cWhile we are gathering additional information to help our members assess the impact on their businesses, the DCC is engaging proactively with Dominion and partners in state and local government to support the determination of the best path forward.\u201d\n\u201cWe\u2019re only two weeks into the discussions, and are still trying to get a handle on the extent of the challenges we\u2019re facing,\u201d said Buddy Rizer, Executive Director, Loudoun County Department of Economic Development, reported in Data Center Frontier. \u201cWe\u2019re going to work with everyone we can to try to figure out what steps we need to take to help deliver for the companies doing business in Loudoun County.\u201d\nPositive side?\nDespite the problem, Digital's Power said Ashburn would not lose importance: \u201cFirst and foremost, I don\u2019t see people leaving Ashburn for this delay. This isn\u2019t like a permanent feature, this is a bottleneck in a portion of Ashburn. And you\u2019ve got an incredible amount of customers, infrastructures, and network. Ashburn grew to where it is for many reasons, and I don\u2019t see demand just running away in the face of this.\u201d\nFor those with existing space in Ashburn, there's a positive side: They can charge more for it.\n\u201cI think the available capacity is going to become more precious,\u201d said Digital Realty's Power. \u201cThe 40 megawatts of operational space that we have today is more precious. And if we\u2019re able to proceed and bring on new capacity that I outlined, that becomes more precious.\"\nPower said this could actually be favorable to Digital overall. As well as the company's 40MW of space in Ashburn, the company has 50MW in a building that should be completed before Dominion cuts off new capacity, 200MW in Manassas in Prince William County, and 200MW on a site near Dulles Airport that has its own substation, and so is free from the overhead powerline issue.\nHowever, the Wells Fargo note gave a darker analysis: \"Digital Realty Trust has meaningful exposure to Ashburn, where it's in the initial stages of building capacity on its 'Western Lands' campus (a 400-acre property that ultimately can provision 1.5 GW of capacity). It appears this power crisis could hinder their ability to deliver capacity on that campus in the near future.\"\nDCD has asked Dominion for comment.\nGet a weekly roundup of North America news, direct to your inbox.\nMore in North America\nIssue 49 - The Rise and Rebirth of Carrier Hotels\nVantage files plans for San Antonio data center\nDiscussion\nMajor Panel: Data Center Operations in the Age of AI\nTags\nWhitepapers\nMore\nImproving data center reliability and efficiency by solving power quality pain points\nSignificant Advancements in Rack PDU Power Quality\nData Center Sustainability Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWorkload Placement Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWatch Now: Building a digital society - What market trends will be driving the industry forward?\nBrowse by Topic\nBrowse by Region\nProducts\nData Centre Dynamics Ltd (DCD), 296-300 St John St, London EC1V 4PAEmail.
