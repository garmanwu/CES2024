EW2Health will demonstrate Sinque as part of the NL Tech Pavilion in Eureka Park, Booth 62100 at the Venetian Expo, from January 9\u201312, 2024. Additionally, EW2Health will pitch on the CES Startup Stage on Wednesday, January 10, 2\u20134 p.m., after winning one of the eight coveted pitch spots among more than 50 competing startups. Watch the video below to learn more about Sinque.\nHow Sinque Works\nSinque benefits weight loss professionals, corporate wellness, health insurance, preventive medicine, and health innovators. The Sinque patented algorithm uses predictive behavioral analytics to learn a user\u2019s weight fluctuation patterns and predict their \u2018true\u2019 weight trend. Health professionals use the Sinque technology dashboard to assess individual and group metrics and to gauge adherence, weight trends and weight loss results. They see quickly who is on track and who needs more attention, eliminating blind spots between appointments. For the first time, professionals can provide truly personalized healthcare in the form of proactive, tailored support based on data and individual needs.\n\u201cAn individual\u2019s weight naturally fluctuates up to 6.6 pounds (3 kilos) per day \u2014 from hydration, medication, time of day, and dozens of other causes \u2014 which routinely leads people to draw the wrong conclusions from the scale,\u201d said EW2Health\u2019s CTO and founder Renato Romani, M.D. \u201cThis is a main cause of the 80% attrition rate we see in weight loss programs. Conversely, Sinque users see their accurate weight trend, receive proactive support from their health professional, and are excited and empowered to stay on track.\"\nBenefits of Sinque include:\nStress-free, numberless monitoring, with weight trend that motivates adherence;\nData-driven, proactive, personalized support, even between appointments;\nIncreased Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), reduced management time and increased program efficiency.\n\u201cThe results of our trials are groundbreaking,\u201d added J\u2019Amy Stewart, EW2Health CEO and co-founder. \u201cIn a recent six-month workplace wellness pilot program with the largest corporation in South America, 25% of participants reduced their BMI, 10% lost \u226510% of their body weight, and the program had an 89% retention rate \u2014 more than quadruple the industry average. This is a game-changer for long-term weight loss results, especially in tandem with new obesity drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro.\u201d\nInterested media, industry partners and investors are invited to contact info@ew2health.com to set up a meeting in Las Vegas at CES 2024, January 9\u201312, 2024.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Press Release\nCES 2024: AI-Powered Weight Loss Takes Center Stage as EW2Health Unveils Game-Changing Sinque Technology\nThe MarketWatch News Department was not involved in the creation of this content.\nSinque trial saw quadruple retention rate, 10% weight loss, and BMI reduction for 25% of participants within six months\nTHE HAGUE, Netherlands, Jan. 5, 2024 /PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- EW2Health (Easy Way to Health), a technology company developing innovative, friendly, data-driven solutions for health professionals, today announced plans to showcase Sinque(TM), its patented behavioral analytics and monitoring solution for weight loss, at CES 2024. EW2Health will demonstrate Sinque as part of the NL Tech Pavilion in Eureka Park, Booth 62100 at the Venetian Expo, from January 9--12, 2024. Additionally, EW2Health will pitch on the CES Startup Stage on Wednesday, January 10, 2--4 p.m., after winning one of the eight coveted pitch spots among more than 50 competing startups. Watch this short video to learn more about Sinque.\nHow Sinque Works\nSinque benefits weight loss professionals, corporate wellness, health insurance, preventive medicine, and health innovators. The Sinque patented algorithm uses predictive behavioral analytics to learn a user's weight fluctuation patterns and predict their 'true' weight trend. Health professionals use the Sinque technology dashboard to assess individual and group metrics and to gauge adherence, weight trends and weight loss results. They see quickly who is on track and who needs more attention, eliminating blind spots between appointments. For the first time, professionals can provide truly personalized healthcare in the form of proactive, tailored support based on data and individual needs.\nPatients of health professionals using Sinque track their progress via the Sinque app and a numberless monitor, which eliminates frustrations with the ups and downs on the scale. Combined, the Sinque tools result in a more successful, sustainable weight-loss journey. Sinque trials demonstrate that combining AI-driven data for health professionals with stress-free user monitoring significantly lowers dropout rates, improves results, and reduces health professionals' management time.\n\"An individual's weight naturally fluctuates up to 6.6 pounds (3 kilos) per day -- from hydration, medication, time of day, and dozens of other causes -- which routinely leads people to draw the wrong conclusions from the scale,\" said EW2Health's CTO and founder Renato Romani, M.D. \"This is a main cause of the 80% attrition rate we see in weight loss programs. Conversely, Sinque users see their accurate weight trend, receive proactive support from their health professional, and are excited and empowered to stay on track.\"\nBenefits of Sinque include:\n\"The results of our trials are groundbreaking,\" added J'Amy Stewart, EW2Health CEO and co-founder. \"In a recent six-month workplace wellness pilot program with the largest corporation in South America, 25% of participants reduced their BMI, 10% lost >=10% of their body weight, and the program had an 89% retention rate -- more than quadruple the industry average. This is a game-changer for long-term weight loss results, especially in tandem with new obesity drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro.\"\nInterested media, industry partners and investors are invited to contact info@ew2health.com to set up a meeting in Las Vegas at CES 2024, January 9--12, 2024.

Reviews ethics statement\nCES 2024 Health Tech: The Things That May Actually Improve Your Wellness\nFrom improvements in diabetes care to glasses that help you hear, here are the highlights from the world's largest consumer electronics show.\nThese Nuance Audio glasses look like a regular pair, but they're built to help you hear better.\nNew health and wellness technology can be an attractive sell because, well, who doesn't want to feel better? At CES this year, some of the new devices and concepts showcased marketed as a means to improve your health -- or at least make you look cool trying to do it.\nHere's a round-up of some of the best and most interesting health and wellness technology that's come out of\u00a0CES\u00a0this year so far. In similar news, read on for\u00a0futuristic concepts, products you can\u00a0already buy today\u00a0and our best of show picks\u00a0for 2024.\nA smart ring with a new edge\nThere's a new smart ring in town: the Evie health tracker. Made by Movano, it won CNET's admiration at CES this year, earning a spot in our best of show. In a world of smartwatches and wearables, what sets Evie apart is that it was designed with women's health in mind, from the fit of the ring itself to the way it interprets data in a holistic way. For more on the Evie ring -- including how comfortable it was to wear, how it tracked steps and more -- check out Bridget Carey's hands-on test of Evie on the CES floor.\nThe Evie ring and app are currently only compatible with iOS, with plans to support Android in the near future. You can order one now for $269 (in gold, rose gold or silver colors) with shipments expected later this month. Unlike Oura ring, there is no monthly subscription for an Evie ring -- just the one-time payment.\nAn all-in-one thermometer, stethoscope and heart health checker\nBeamO is a four-in-one health-scanning device.\nThe BeamO from Withings is a Wii-looking thermometer that does it all -- takes your temperature, checks your heart rate and blood oxygen levels, and even works as a stethoscope.\nDesigned to be easy to carry and light to hold, the BeamO is entering the market post-pandemic, where telemedicine visits are still the norm. But increasingly, patients want quick access to basic health information that providers may normally collect in-office.\nBeamO could help anyone who wants easy insights into their heart and lung health (and temperature, of course) monitor their baselines and share information with their health care providers. Following expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nGlasses that let you hear better\nThe Nuance Audio glasses can amplify the voice of the person you're speaking to.\nThe Nuance Audio glasses from EssilorLuxottica were made for people with mild or moderate hearing loss -- those who notice they have some trouble hearing in noisy, busy places. They have technology built right into the glasses frames that will amplify sound. To adjust the volume, users can tweak the glasses themselves or use the companion app. You'll also be able to add your vision prescription to the lenses.\nA pair of Nuance Audio specs will provide a different way for people to improve their hearing. Even now that the FDA is allowing over-the-counter hearing aid sales so people can get a hearing aid without a prescription,\u00a0high cost and perceived stigma of wearing hearing aids are still barriers to treatment for many people. (There's no official word on how much the Nuance Audio glasses will cost yet.)\nNuance Audio glasses are expected to be available in late 2024 in the US. They aren't a replacement for hearing aids, but EssilorLuxottica is registering them with the FDA as an over-the-counter hearing device.\nRead more: This Smart Bed Adjusts to Your Body With AI Sensors and Strings\nAn air conditioner for your neck\nA personal air conditioner that travels with you.\nTorras, which makes wearable air conditioners for your neck, announced a new model of its personal air condition at CES this year, the Coolify Cyber. While it's not a new concept this year (there are other models available for sale), it's the company's latest version of an air conditioning product that fits around the back of your neck to keep you cool -- not a bad choice for a hot day walking around, and one of the more approachable wellness items.\nIt works by running an electrical current between a semiconductor and a ceramic cooling plate that sits on your neck. CNET's Nick Wolny had a chance to test out the Torras' neck air conditioner, describing it as a positive experience that was \"a blast of cold air, but like a neck pillow that energized me.\"\nA toothbrush that tells you when you're doing it wrong\nThis year at CES, the Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush made its debut as a smart toothbrush that uses bone-conduction technology and an AI voice guide to give you tips on your brushing technique, including whether you're brushing too hard or focusing too much time in one part of your mouth. It has five brush modes designed for specific needs or times of the day and an interactive touch screen that can tell you where you missed a spot. The Oclean X Ultra will launch in the US this fall and costs $130.\nCES 2024: Kitchen Tech and Cooking Tools That Caused the Biggest Stir\nImproved diabetes tech\nA mold of the Mobi, Tandem's tiny automated delivery system.\nThe big diabetes device companies had a presence at CES this year, showcasing the latest improvements in technology for people with Type 1 diabetes. Last summer, Tandem\u00a0announced FDA clearance\u00a0of its Mobi insulin pump, the world's smallest automated insulin delivery system. And at the 2024 CES, the company brought it in for a showcase ahead of its anticipated launch early this year.\nAbbott and Tandem also just announced a US integration of Abbott's newest continuous glucose monitor, the\u00a0FreestyleLibre 2 Plus Sensor, with Tandem's T:slim X2 insulin pump.\nAt launch, the Mobi will be compatible with the Dexcom G6 sensor, with Dexcom G7 and Abbott's Freestyle Libre 2 Plus sensor compatibility anticipated to follow, according to a press release.\nNew at-home smart UTI test\nVivoo's at-home urine tests pair with an app.\nUrinary tract infections (known as\u00a0UTIs) are a common reason for a trip to the doctor.\u00a0Vivoo, a health tech company that makes at-home urine tests with a partnered app, announced a new UTI test that gives users quick results that are stored on an app.\nVivoo said in a press release it's able to give UTI results through its \"deep learning image processing technology\" through its software.\nTo use it, download the Vivoo app first. Then, pee on the strip and scan it to get results on the app. Because it's stored on an app, you can easily share results with a health care provider to get a prescription or treatment.\nAt-home urine strips (even for UTIs) aren't new to DIY health care, but having a test available to people in partial app form can be useful for those who want more privacy or people who want to narrow down the cause of their symptoms. It also follows in the footsteps of other pee-based CES tech, like last year's toilet sensor from Withings.\nRead more: Anti-Snore Pillows at CES: This Smart Pillow Senses When You're Sawing Logs\nA wearable that's supposed to track your focus and agility\nThe Pison Ready wristband\nWe're all used to companies boasting their health-tracking and fitness-monitoring features, but what about how clear-headed and mentally sharp you're feeling? This year at CES, makers of the Pison Ready claim they can track just that.\nThe Pison Ready is made to measure metrics of mental focus, reaction time and agility through tests taken on your wrist, as demonstrated by CNET's Lisa Eadicicco. Pison Technology says it can zone in on your mental alertness by detecting neurological signals from the brain that suggest mental acuity. The company initially based its neural biosensing technology to benefit amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients.\nThe Pison Ready launches in February and will be available as a subscription -- three months for $59, a year for $119 and two years for $199. It's not clear right now how practical it'll be for most people -- or how accurately it shows people's real-time ability to stay focused -- but the availability of a wearable that measures more heady wellness metrics, as opposed to more strict health metrics like blood oxygen or sleep stages, could potentially be an advancement in the wellness bubble in 2024.\nRead on for some of the wackiest tech at CES this year,\u00a0which robots we saw there, and the\u00a0most cutting-edge tech for 2024.\nOther Wellness Guides\nPersonal Care\nSleep\nFitness\nNutrition\nMedical and Mental Health"

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nCES 2024 Preview: Innovations In Wearables And Health\nCES logo\nCES 2024 takes place from January 9 to January 12 in Las Vegas. It\u2019s a giant technology show where innovations across consumer and health tech are shown off.\nMore than 115,000 people came to the show in 2023, and 2024 is set to be even larger according to the official stats.\nThere will be plenty of surprises at the show, but some of the health tech and wearable-related tech there is already known. And there are clues as to some bits that have not been officially announced. Here are some of the most notable examples.\nWithings: Eye catching innovation?\nYou can hope for something intriguing from Withings, even if it will not appear on sale all that soon. At CES 2023, Withings showed the U-Scan, a headline-grabber of an announcement. The U-Scan is a urine analysis sensor designed to be mounted inside your toilet bowl. It can measure ketones, Vitamin C levels, water composition and acid base. One year on it\u2019s still listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on the Withings website. It has teased something equally compelling may be at CES 2024, tweeting \u201cthe dawn of our next revolution is imminent\u201d on December 22.\nFitbit: Luxe 2?\nWhile there is no major suggestion Fitbit has bit launch plans for CES 2024, there are some signs a Fitbit Luxe 2 is on the way. A wearable that, assuming there are no brand new lines in the works, must be either the Luxe 2 or an Ace 4, has passed through the FCC. Such a watch is likely to appear at some point in Q4 2024. However, will it come to CES? That is much less clear. The Fitbit Luxe arrived in 2021. And Fitbit has not seen many launches since Google\u2019s acquisition of the brand in January 2021.\nSo When Is The\nRebel Moon\nR Rated Snyder Cut s Release Date Then\nMassive California Waves Hospitalize At Least Eight And Cause Evacuations Along Pacific Coast\nThree Supermoons, Two Comets And The \u2018Great American Eclipse:\u2019 The Sky In 2024\nSamsung: Fit 3 incoming\nThe Samsung Fit 3 leaked in November and is expected to launch in January. It's more likely to be seen as part of confidential meetings at CES than a major public announcement, though, as Samsung will hold one of its big Unpacked events on January 18. That\u2019s just a few days after CES closes up shop. The watch\u2019s predecessor, the Galaxy Fit 2, arrived way back in 2020. This one has a much larger OLED screen, which should make it feel more like a smartwatch.\nRuah: Easier sleep apnea diagnosis\nRuahlab Inc.\u2019s Ruah wearable has received an innovation award from the CES CEA organisation even before the show begins. From a glance it looks a bit like a face mask worn only over the nose. However, it\u2019s an AI-powered device that monitors breathing patterns, in order to help diagnose sleep apnea. As such, it\u2019s a much more convenient alternative to polysomnography, which uses a multi-sensor polysomnogram to assess sleep abnormalities.\nAbbott: Glucose monitoring\nAccording to Wareable, Abbott plans to show its consumer-focused Lingo continuous glucose monitor tech at CES 2024. This means we could be getting closer to an expansion into the US. Lingo is already available in the UK, where it costs \u00a3150 (around $190) a month and is sold as \"the future of metabolism ownership.\u201d Lingo involves wearing a biosensor to monitor for glucose spikes.\nInception Lab: Bedsore diagnosis\nInception Lab is another winner of a CES innovation award. Its work is in the healthcare industry, but is a technology anyone can understand. It has made a bedsore sensor called Inception One. They are placed in \u201careas suspected of bedsores\u201d in order to help diagnose the problem without relying simply on a visual inspection.\nYou can expect news at CES to start pumping out from January 7, one of two \u201cMedia Days\u201d ahead of the show\u2019s opening."

        "raw_content": "Sinque trial saw quadruple retention rate, 10% weight loss, and\nBMI reduction for 25% of participants within six months\nTHE\nHAGUE, Netherlands, Jan. 5, 2024\n/PRNewswire-PRWeb/ -- EW2Health (Easy Way to Health), a technology\ncompany developing innovative, friendly, data-driven solutions for\nhealth professionals, today announced plans to showcase Sinque\u2122,\nits patented behavioral analytics and monitoring solution for\nweight loss, at CES 2024. EW2Health will demonstrate Sinque as part\nof the NL Tech Pavilion in Eureka Park, Booth 62100 at the Venetian\nExpo, from January 9\u201312, 2024. Additionally, EW2Health will pitch\non the CES Startup Stage on Wednesday,\nJanuary 10, 2\u20134 p.m., after winning one of the eight coveted\npitch spots among more than 50 competing startups. Watch this short\nvideo to learn more about Sinque.\nHow Sinque Works\nSinque benefits weight loss professionals, corporate wellness,\nhealth insurance, preventive medicine, and health innovators. The\nSinque patented algorithm uses predictive behavioral analytics to\nlearn a user's weight fluctuation patterns and predict their 'true'\nweight trend. Health professionals use the Sinque technology\ndashboard to assess individual and group metrics and to gauge\nadherence, weight trends and weight loss results. They see quickly\nwho is on track and who needs more attention, eliminating blind\nspots between appointments. For the first time, professionals can\nprovide truly personalized healthcare in the form of proactive,\ntailored support based on data and individual needs.\nPatients of health professionals using Sinque track their\nprogress via the Sinque app and a numberless monitor, which\neliminates frustrations with the ups and downs on the scale.\nCombined, the Sinque tools result in a more successful, sustainable\nweight-loss journey. Sinque trials demonstrate that combining\nAI-driven data for health professionals with stress-free user\nmonitoring significantly lowers dropout rates, improves results,\nand reduces health professionals' management time.\n\"An individual's weight naturally fluctuates up to 6.6 pounds (3\nkilos) per day \u2014 from hydration, medication, time of day, and\ndozens of other causes \u2014 which routinely leads people to draw the\nwrong conclusions from the scale,\" said EW2Health's CTO and founder\nRenato Romani, M.D. \"This is a main\ncause of the 80% attrition rate we see in weight loss programs.\nConversely, Sinque users see their accurate weight trend, receive\nproactive support from their health professional, and are excited\nand empowered to stay on track.\"\nBenefits of Sinque include:\n\"The results of our trials are groundbreaking,\" added J'Amy\nStewart, EW2Health CEO and co-founder. \"In a recent six-month\nworkplace wellness pilot program with the largest corporation in\nSouth America, 25% of participants\nreduced their BMI, 10% lost \u226510% of their body weight, and the\nprogram had an 89% retention rate \u2014 more than quadruple the\nindustry average. This is a game-changer for long-term weight loss\nresults, especially in tandem with new obesity drugs like Ozempic\nand Mounjaro.\"\nInterested media, industry partners and investors are invited to\ncontact info@ew2health.com to set up a meeting in Las Vegas at CES 2024, January 9\u201312, 2024.\nAccess the press kit here.\nAbout EW2Health\nEW2Health BV is a pioneering Dutch technology startup with\nfriendly, data-driven solutions that enable personalized health\nusing AI-based predictive behavioral analytics. EW2Health's first\ngoal is to reverse the global obesity epidemic and significantly\nreduce associated healthcare costs through effective personalized\nhealthcare.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Wearable tech products stealing the show this year\nAs CES 2024 concludes for another year, it\u2019s an opportune moment to look back at the health and fitness gadgets that made their mark at the event in Las Vegas, which took place between January 9th and 12th.\nCES stands as the world\u2019s most significant and influential technology event. For tech aficionados, it\u2019s an unparalleled experience. Its closest counterpart is IFA, held annually in Berlin at the start of September.\nHistorically, these expos have been pivotal in introducing technologies we now consider commonplace. This year, Fitbit, Fossil, and Xiaomi disappointed with no new announcements. Consistent with previous years, Apple did not participate. Nevertheless, wearables maintained a strong presence in 2024.\nThe event sprawled across 2.75 million square feet, featuring over 2,000 exhibitors. These included manufacturers, developers, and suppliers of consumer technology hardware and content. The conference program boasted more than 1,000 speakers. It\u2019s estimated that over 100,000 attendees visited the event.\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of our top wearable tech picks from the Las Vegas showrooms. These are just a handful of our favorites. Our comprehensive coverage of CES 2024 can be found on this link.\nAmazfit Helio Ring\nOur top pick this year is the Amazfit Helio Ring, a product by Zepp Health, marking their first venture into the realm of smart rings. This device is specifically designed for athletes, focusing on optimizing recovery and enhancing performance. Unlike typical smart rings that mainly track sleep for the general public, the Helio Ring provides in-depth insights into both mental and physical conditions, a feature particularly beneficial for athletes.\nThe Helio Ring\u2019s standout feature is its ability to convert complex health data into a simple Readiness score. By monitoring sleep heart rate, HRV, breathing, and body temperature overnight, the ring, in conjunction with the Zepp App, calculates this score to help athletes decide whether to focus on training or recovery. This aids in planning workouts more effectively. The ring also offers comprehensive sleep and recovery tracking, including analysis of sleep quality, sleep stages, and sleep breathing quality. Additionally, it features EDA emotional monitoring, which assesses physical signs like hand sweat to indicate emotional stress.\nMind you, this is not the only smart ring which made its appearance. Also there were RingConn with their excellent offering, along with Evie Ring, Velia Ring, YogiFi Ring and Dcare Ring. Its shaping up to be an exciting year for smart rings!\nWithings BeamO\nNext up on our list is the Withings BeamO, a groundbreaking health monitoring device that combines the futuristic vision of Star Trek with practical technology. BeamO allows users to perform a 4-in-1 health checkup, including body temperature, heart, and lung health, in under a minute.\nBeamO, the world\u2019s 1st multiscope for revolutionary at-home checkups, was unveiled at #CES2024 \u2014 our booth has been packed with people and the awards just keep coming.If you couldn\u2019t make it to CES or get through the crowds, here\u2019s PM Livia Robic with a personal demo for you. pic.twitter.com/LqZrk9ljzO\nThe thing functions as a thermometer, ECG, oximeter, and stethoscope, using photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodes for accurate readings. BeamO also features a non-contact temperature sensor and a digital stethoscope with a Piezoelectric disc for detailed heart and lung assessments. The data syncs with the Withings Health app, providing insights and enabling telehealth consultations.\nPriced at $249.95 the device is set to be available in June 2024. BeamO is recognized as a CES Innovations Award Honoree and represents a significant advancement in home health monitoring technology.\nGarmin Lily 2\nAnother standout device from CES 2024 is the Garmin Lily 2, a successor to the original Garmin Lily launched in 2021. The Lily 2 retains the stylish and functional appeal of its predecessor but introduces several notable upgrades. It features an improved heart rate sensor, new fitness modes, and NFC payments.\nDesign-wise, the model retains a classic round shape, but the Lily 2 upgrades the build to anodized aluminum for enhanced durability and sophistication. The Lily 2 also simplifies band switching with a more standard lug design. As before, there\u2019s a TFT LCD with 16-level grayscale on-board. The Lily 2 stands out with its Gen 4 Elevate sensor, improving health and fitness tracking, and introduces NFC for contactless payments, a feature absent in the original Lily. Priced slightly higher than the original, the Lily 2 offers a blend of fashion, functionality, and fitness tracking, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a stylish, compact wearable.\nGarmin HRM-Fit\nAlso among our favorite picks from CES 2024 is the Garmin HRM-Fit, a heart rate monitor specifically designed for women. Priced at $150, it offers a snug fit and is compatible with medium to high support sports bras, accommodating a variety of body types. Its design ensures stability and comfort during intense workouts, although it\u2019s advised not to use it with certain types of bras like longline, front zip, and light support variants.\nFunctionally, the HRM-Fit excels in providing precise heart rate data, surpassing the accuracy of wrist-based devices. It supports advanced workout tracking, including metrics like vertical oscillations, ground contact time, and stride length, crucial for detailed running form analysis. With a battery life of up to one year (based on daily one-hour usage) and water resistance up to 50 feet, it\u2019s built for endurance and versatility.\nNowatch hybrid\nNowatch, a Dutch startup, has evolved from a mindful health tracker to a sophisticated hybrid smartwatch, showcased at CES 2024. The original Nowatch, known for its stress prediction using an electrodermal sensor (EDA), has now incorporated Chronos \u2018timepiece faces\u2019, adding the functionality of time display while maintaining its focus on mindfulness and stress awareness.\nThe AI Insights feature provides daily summaries and recommendations based on the wearer\u2019s stress data, sleep, and activity stats. The design of Nowatch, featuring interchangeable discs made of polished metal and gemstones, emphasizes wearability and style. This evolution marks Nowatch\u2019s journey in the wearable technology space, focusing on aesthetics, mindfulness, and a user-customizable experience.\nUltrahuman Home\nUltrahuman has introduced Ultrahuman Home at CES 2024, a device that tracks and enhances the health of living spaces. This innovative product extends Ultrahuman\u2019s wearable tech expertise to environmental health monitoring. It provides insights into factors like artificial light, air quality, humidity, and noise levels, correlating them with individual lifestyle factors such as sleep and stress.\nIntroducing Ultrahuman Home! It is a sleek yet powerful device that will provide insights on an individual's external environment including exposure to artificial light, air quality, humidity and noise levels. It\u2019s a first for the wearable space to leverage home health data and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SV33UHFp2q\nUltrahuman Home offers a longitudinal view of environmental markers and their impact on health over time, featuring capabilities like natural light spectrum monitoring, PM detection, noise detection, humidity level monitoring, and blue light exposure monitoring. Set to launch on Kickstarter for USD $349, Ultrahuman Home represents a novel approach to integrating personal and environmental health monitoring.\nMomentum Sport Earbuds\nThe Sennheiser Momentum Sport Earbuds, a result of the collaboration between Polar and Sennheiser, were also introduced at CES 2024. These earbuds combine Sennheiser\u2019s renowned sound quality with Polar\u2019s advanced fitness tracking technologies. They feature a semi-open design, active noise cancellation, and an anti-wind mode, making them ideal for outdoor activities. With an IP55 rating for moisture and dust resistance, they promise up to six hours of battery life.\nUnique to these earbuds is the integration of Polar\u2019s Flow data analytics, which includes a photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor for efficient workout planning. Priced at $329.95, they offer a comprehensive workout experience, combining high-quality audio with sophisticated fitness tracking.\nLike\u00a0this article?\u00a0Subscribe to our monthly newsletter\u00a0and\u00a0never miss out!\nMarko founded Gadgets & Wearables in 2014, having worked for more than 15 years in the City of London\u2019s financial district.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "Three Digital Health Trends to Watch at CES 2024\nCES 2024 is less than four months away, and in advance of the world\u2019s largest and most influential consumer technology showcase, Future Healthcare Today is exploring some of the top trends and stories that are shaping the consumer electronics industry.\nOf all consumer technology sectors and markets, few have as explosive potential for growth as the digital health solution marketplace. These technologies saw a massive increase in adoption from the COVID-19 pandemic, which raised important questions about access to healthcare, and made people around the globe more invested in their own health and wellness. However, despite the rapid adoption over the past half of a decade, the digital health solution market segment is still relatively nascent, with considerable room and opportunity to grow.\nThese emerging digital health solutions have the ability to give consumers control of their own health and wellness. This is a massive change for many consumers that are accustomed to a healthcare industry that mainly functions to treat illness when it happens and restricts access to care to those with health insurance, referrals, or geographic proximity to providers.\nWith seven out of ten consumers saying they\u2019re likely to adopt digital health solutions, organizers anticipate a massive increase in interest and demand for these solutions at CES\u2026\nIt\u2019s no surprise, then, that research from the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) found that 70 percent of consumers say they will likely use one or more digital health solutions in the future to improve their overall health or well-being. It\u2019s also not shocking that the use of telehealth among providers skyrocketed from 14 percent in 2016, to more than 80 percent in 2022, according to Healthcare IT News.\nWith seven out of ten consumers saying they\u2019re likely to adopt digital health solutions, organizers anticipate a massive increase in interest and demand for these solutions at CES, the world\u2019s preeminent consumer electronic showcase hosted annually by the CTA.\nThis year\u2019s event \u2013 which will take place in early January in Las Vegas \u2013 is the perfect venue to see some of the innovative digital health solutions entering the marketplace, and an incredible opportunity for solution providers to demonstrate exciting new digital healthcare capabilities. This is why healthcare technology companies such as Nuheara, CareWear Corp, Wearable Therapeutics, and Essence SmartCare attend CES.\nBut what overarching digital health trends will be on display at this year\u2019s show? And what are consumers looking for when analyzing and weighing investments in new digital health products and solutions? The CTA recently released a study entitled, Driving Consumer Adoption of Digital Health Solutions, that could enlighten health tech companies. Here are three factors that will impact digital health solutions at this year\u2019s CES:\nTaking control and becoming proactive\nAs we discussed, healthcare in much of the world for much of the past few decades has revolved around treating illness when consumers have symptoms of disease. Rarely have consumers had access to their own vitals and detailed information about their own health and wellness \u2013 often having to wait until they don\u2019t feel well and get sent by a doctor for a litany of expensive tests.\nThe COVID pandemic and emerging digital healthcare technologies have put a stop to that. People around the world are actively looking to take control of their health and become more proactive in their own wellness \u2013 trying to actively stave off disease and chronic illness with changes in behavior or routine.\nMoving forward, consumers are looking for these solutions to add increased functionality and capabilities, make health information more easily accessible, and increase the reliability of data\nThis has led to increased demand for Fitbits, smartwatches, and other wearable solutions that consumers can regularly use to monitor their overall health. According to the CTA\u2019s research, 73 percent of consumers report that these solutions help them feel more in control of their health, and encourage them to take better care of themselves. Additionally, 71 percent claimed that these solutions have raised their quality of life.\nMoving forward, consumers are looking for these solutions to add increased functionality and capabilities, make health information more easily accessible, and increase the reliability of data. Anticipate that the solutions being exhibited at this year\u2019s CES will deliver on many of these consumer requirements.\nIncreasing access for all\nAccording to CTA research, 59 percent of people have utilized telehealth appointments even with the pandemic in the rearview mirror. And there is a very good reason why telehealth offerings are so popular.\nWithin the U.S., in particular, there is limited access to healthcare among underserved populations. About 112 million people \u2013 approximately 40 percent of American adults \u2013 struggle to pay for healthcare. And, due to shortages in specialists and other healthcare professionals, and most healthcare providers concentrated around metropolitan areas, approximately live more than ten miles away from their nearest hospital. 18 percent of Americans live more than ten miles away from their nearest hospital.\nIt is imperative that underserved Americans can receive the healthcare they need.\nDigital health solutions \u2013 such as telehealth services \u2013 can help to overcome this challenge by offering a way to get health care without the need to go to an office or hospital building. This means more Americans can access quality healthcare and specialist care \u2013 including mental health services and addiction services \u2013 without ever leaving their homes.\nThis change in how we access healthcare services was the focus of a session during CES 2023 entitled, The Future of Care in America: A New Hybrid Model. In this session, visionaries from across the healthcare and healthcare technology industries explored ways in which technology is enabling a new model for patient care. You can watch that session in full in the video below:\nConsidering the historic challenges that Americans have faced in receiving and accessing care, it\u2019s no surprise that telehealth services and other digital health services remain in demand \u2013 and why they\u2019ll be featured prominently at the upcoming CES 2024.\nBringing it all together\nAnyone who has experienced the American healthcare system in the previous few decades understands how disjointed and disconnected it can be. A primary care doctor may refer a patient to a specialist, only to find that the results of previously conducted tests aren\u2019t available to them \u2013 requiring new tests to be run at the patient\u2019s expense. Or, a patient may find themselves answering the same questions repeatedly each and every time they see a different doctor or specialist.\nThe integration and sharing of healthcare data can open the door to incredible futuristic and beneficial capabilities.\nThis lack of connectivity and interoperability has made healthcare incredibly expensive and less effective. And for digital health solutions and services to truly reach their potential, information needs to be securely shared, and every system and source of healthcare data needs to interoperate.\nThe integration and sharing of healthcare data can open the door to incredible futuristic and beneficial capabilities. Doctors will be able to securely and remotely access and review the vital signs of a patient from the wearable that\u2019s monitoring them. AI will be able to analyze all available healthcare data and patient histories to identify illnesses and effective treatments in seconds rather than days or weeks.\nBut these capabilities are only possible if everything is integrated and interoperated. And this is why integration and interoperability will be two incredibly in-demand capabilities for digital health devices and services at CES 2024.\nCES is the home for digital health innovation that draws the most innovative companies that are breaking new ground in modern healthcare. Find out what\u2019s new as this field evolves, and what\u2019s next at CES 2024.\nRELATED\nPOSTS\nUnderfunded Hospitals Result in Reduced Access to Emergency Care\nHow AI is Revolutionizing Healthcare from Patient Experience to Operations and Cost Management\nAdvancing Healthcare IT: A Closer Look at Government Initiatives from the ONC, HHS, and VA\nTRENDING NOW\nThree Digital Health Trends to Watch at CES 2024\nDefense in Depth Strategy Protects Healthcare Organizations from Cyber Attacks\nUnlocking the Potential of Mentorship in Healthcare\nHealth-Seekers Level Up Self-Care with Gamification Apps\nAppalachian Regional Healthcare Transforms Machine Learning Insights into Improved Patient Experience\nCONNECT WITH US\nBECOME AN INSIDER\nI consent to having Future Healthcare Today collect my email and I agree to the Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.\nStrategic Communications Group is a digital media company that helps business-to-business marketers drive customer demand through content marketing, content syndication, and lead identification.\nRelated Communities\nFinancial Technology Today\nGovernment Technology Insider\nModern Marketing Today\nRetail Technology Insider\nToday\u2019s Modern Educator\nQuick Links\nBecome a Sponsor\nFuture Healthcare Today offers content and advertising sponsorships to leading healthcare solution and service providers.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nMonitoring People's Health Was A Notable Theme At CES 2024\nNew tech devices for health-monitoring populated the aisles of CES 2024.\nLast week, I mentioned in my Consumer Electronics Show columns that this January show was my 49th winter CES. In a small way, I have become a historian of this event. That has led people who know about my history of attending the show to ask how CES has evolved since I first attended it in the late 1970s.\nWhen I first went to CES, the focus was on VCRs and large hand-held video cameras. It even had a shady side, as the early adopters of VCRs were the adult entertainment industry. Many vendors who had new VCRs and video cameras to hawk, and even unrelated product companies would hire Playboy and Penthouse models and even porn stars to sign autographs in their booths to attract buyers. Interestingly, this was the origin of the \"booth babes\" term that was part of the CES vernacular until the show banned this practice in the late 1980s after it received significant criticism for this practice. This era was decades before flat-panel TVs and the more advanced technology we see at the show today.\nHowever, its evolution in the past 10 years has made CES a catchall show in tech that now includes smart cars, smart homes, health and fitness, advancements in televisions, streaming video, high-end gaming and just about anything that has a tech angle to a product or service.\nHowever, the one new area that CES has focused on that is a huge deal is the area of health, fitness and, more importantly, health monitoring.\nClose to 100 booths and private rooms showed products in this category. I admit that as I age, health, fitness and health monitoring have become more important to me, but it is an area that everyone should be interested in to stay healthy and fit.\nWith that in mind, here are a few of the products I saw this year that got my attention.\nWithings BeamO\nDemocrat Goldman Introduces Censure Resolution Against GOP\u2019s Stefanik For Calling Jan. 6 Defendants \u2018Hostages\u2019\nGovernment Shutdown Deadline Expected To Move To March\nEnroll Now For Early Student Loan Forgiveness, Says Biden: How To Apply\nDigital health company Withings announced its BeamO \"multiscope,\" a device that can perform four health checks in under a minute.\nThe BeamO fuses the capabilities of a thermometer, electrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope in an at-home checkup device. It is a multiscope that can do more than a fitness watch.\nBeamO combines these specialized sensors to turn their device into a powerful tool for regularly monitoring heart and lung health. It is portable and smaller than a smartphone.\nBeamO's design is to help individuals and families perform at-home checkups and substantially improve the quality of telehealth visits.The aim is to let people do more tests at home and talk to doctors on remote calls about the results, advancing the efficiency of telemedicine.\nStelo by Dexcom\nI have been a Type 2 diabetic for 27 years and have to monitor my blood sugars constantly. I am also insulin-dependent and use the Dexcom G7 CGM to help me determine my insulin dosages. Dexcom has now launched a new product that should be available later this year called the Stelo.\nWhat's different about the Stelo is its design for Type 2 diabetes patients who don't need insulin. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% or more of diabetes cases, yet these people don't always have a clear idea of which foods spike their blood sugar and what to do about it.\nFor someone on insulin, knowing their blood sugars is a life-and-death issue. For those not using insulin, learning about their blood sugars and how certain foods impact their blood sugars is a health issue that can help prevent their diabetes from getting worse. Abbot has a similar product called the Lingo Glucose Monitoring Biosensor. Both are essential tools for people with diabetes to manage this disease proactively.\nUltraHuman Smart Ring Air\nThere were many smart rings at the show, but the UltraHuman Ring Air is the only smart ring that uses fighter jet titanium that I have tested that monitors sleep, movement, recovery, nutrition and many fitness tracking data points. It has a six-axis motion sensor delivering accurate data and is water-resistant at a depth of 330 feet. I met with them at the show and was allowed to test it during CES. I found the sleep data better than the fitness tracker I wore at the show, and its step counter was very accurate.\nVivoo\nVivoo is a home testing tool that uses urine to diagnose nine important health-related data points. The company calls it a wellness platform that gives real-time data on water, magnesium, calcium, vitamin C, PH, keytones, sodium, oxidative stress and protein. A one-time purchase, which includes four Vivoo tests, is $39. They also offer monthly subscriptions for people who want or need to test more often to monitor these data points regularly.\nThis test highlights this new category of home health monitoring that has emerged to allow people to be more proactive in managing their health. This category includes smartwatches, fitness trackers, etc. Indeed, I saw at least 25 new smart health watches, fitness trackers and other health monitoring devices, including highly portable blood pressure tools and other health-related wearables.\nAlthough many dedicated medical shows have highlighted these health monitoring products, CES has become the leading consumer technology show in North America, where health has become a significant focus of this yearly event."

EW2Health will demonstrate Sinque as part of the NL Tech Pavilion in Eureka Park, Booth 62100 at the Venetian Expo, from January 9\u201312, 2024. Additionally, EW2Health will pitch on the CES Startup Stage on Wednesday, January 10, 2\u20134 p.m., after winning one of the eight coveted pitch spots among more than 50 competing startups. Watch this short video to learn more about Sinque.\nHow Sinque Works\nSinque benefits weight loss professionals, corporate wellness, health insurance, preventive medicine, and health innovators. The Sinque patented algorithm uses predictive behavioral analytics to learn a user's weight fluctuation patterns and predict their 'true' weight trend. Health professionals use the Sinque technology dashboard to assess individual and group metrics and to gauge adherence, weight trends and weight loss results. They see quickly who is on track and who needs more attention, eliminating blind spots between appointments. For the first time, professionals can provide truly personalized healthcare in the form of proactive, tailored support based on data and individual needs.\nPatients of health professionals using Sinque track their progress via the Sinque app and a numberless monitor, which eliminates frustrations with the ups and downs on the scale. Combined, the Sinque tools result in a more successful, sustainable weight-loss journey. Sinque trials demonstrate that combining AI-driven data for health professionals with stress-free user monitoring significantly lowers dropout rates, improves results, and reduces health professionals' management time.\n\"An individual's weight naturally fluctuates up to 6.6 pounds (3 kilos) per day \u2014 from hydration, medication, time of day, and dozens of other causes \u2014 which routinely leads people to draw the wrong conclusions from the scale,\" said EW2Health's CTO and founder Renato Romani, M.D. \"This is a main cause of the 80% attrition rate we see in weight loss programs. Conversely, Sinque users see their accurate weight trend, receive proactive support from their health professional, and are excited and empowered to stay on track.\"\nBenefits of Sinque include:\n\"The results of our trials are groundbreaking,\" added J'Amy Stewart, EW2Health CEO and co-founder. \"In a recent six-month workplace wellness pilot program with the largest corporation in South America, 25% of participants reduced their BMI, 10% lost \u226510% of their body weight, and the program had an 89% retention rate \u2014 more than quadruple the industry average. This is a game-changer for long-term weight loss results, especially in tandem with new obesity drugs like Ozempic and Mounjaro.\"\nInterested media, industry partners and investors are invited to contact info@ew2health.com to set up a meeting in Las Vegas at CES 2024, January 9\u201312, 2024.
