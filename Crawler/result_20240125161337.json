Share it with your friends!\nASSIST Software brought quality Romanian software solutions to the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. CES is one of the most visited tech fairs focusing on consumer electronics. Innovative software engineers worldwide go there to showcase their ideas to a rapidly changing professional landscape.\nCustom software solutions and solid expertise\nAttendees can find the Romanian software company at the Venetian Expo in Hall D if they wish to get a glimpse of what the Suceava-based company offers. As one of the most important tech suppliers, Romania continues to attract business all over the world for its skilled engineers and competitive prices.\nThe internationally recognized programmers working at ASSIST Software are the driving force of a company with a 31-year experience in technology. They have made a name for themselves for being knowledgeable team members with a can-do attitude in any project they undertake.\nThe way ASSIST Software addresses international collaborations attracts attention\nHowever, working with the Romanian company is more straightforward than it might seem, even with the time zone difference to account for. CES attendees can use this opportunity to discover more about the flexible collaboration models the company has set in place precisely to accommodate both partners and employees.\n\"When you have a team of 400 people and provide services globally, you must establish adaptable collaboration models. Some projects we're working on have assigned a massive, dedicated team, while others are based on team augmentation, where we work with the client's framework. I think people are always pleasantly surprised by how adaptable we are as a team and how much we truly care about delivering quality in whatever shape or form,\" says Andrei Ungurean, Head of Business Operations, when asked about what makes ASSIST Software unique among the plethora of CES attendees.\nMore than code writers\nHowever, not only ASSIST Software's skill holds people off at the Romania IT stand. Remarkable abilities and vast knowledge of technology spark in-depth conversations about code, best practices, and the best technologies to work within specific areas.\nUntil now, ASSIST Software has distinguished itself through successful collaborations in medical, educational, sports, financial, and retail fields. Thus, the company's portfolio today includes hundreds of projects of various sizes that have helped create a vast catalog of technologies with which these Romanian programmers work at international standards.\n\"Being at CES allows us to see what consumer electronics will look like, but it also gives us a glimpse into the most popular technologies of the year. It's great to know what the market is after because innovation is truly disruptive when addressing real issues and trends people deal with daily,\" says Alexandru Boca, ASSIST Software's Head of Mobile Technologies.\nEmbedded software engineering and custom hardware\nThis year, as ASSIST Software is starting the year by attending a conference where electronics are the focus, the team has revealed some of the past embedded software engineering it has worked on. Most recently, ASSIST Software partnered with high-end audio manufacturers and has been working hard with them to elevate their internationally acclaimed products.\nAudioByte is one of the companies ASSIST Software partnered with and for whom the software company has developed embedded systems to great success. AudioByte is also present at CES, where people can see one of their most recently launched audio products.\nWhy ASSIST Software?\nUndoubtedly, CES is one of the most important fairs in the whole world and is also called the testing ground for revolutionary technologies proposed by global innovators. Owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)\u00ae, CES is the only trade show that showcases the entire tech landscape in one event. The most popular technologies in 2024 are from areas such as the Internet of Things (IoT), digital health, artificial intelligence (AI), and augmented reality (AR). Thus, ASSIST Software easily fits in as an exhibitor and stands out as a reliable partner.\n*This is a Press release.\nFrom Suceava to Las Vegas: ASSIST Software attends CES 2024\nLike this article?

ASSIST\u00a0Software always understood firmly the requirements and were able to implement the applications. The quality of project management and implementation of the systems were excellent. The services they provided were at anytime professional, the results have always been in time. We can strongly recommend working with ASSIST Software.\nWe have found at ASSIST Software a young and ambitious team, which has dedicated their energy and proficiency to bring live a unique project for the Romanian market: Love Factory powered by Love Plus. Although a social game of such extent and complexity has been a challenge for both teams in Bucharest and Suceava, we have greatly appreciated their willingness to learn and bring to fruition an novel and valuable concept.\nI've collaborated with ASSIST in an EU FP7 funded research project and I am writing to both endorse and recommend ASSIST as a partner for such projects.\nThe best measure of success for me is the feedback from the partners of the project where we participate - my colleagues have been laudatory in their comments and have achieved the overall objective with the excellent support of ASSIST.\nI am writing to express my most confident recommendation of ASSIST Software as participants in collaborative European research projects.\nMy organization, Ateknea, has collaborated with ASSIST in European FP7 research project PR 2.0. As Coordinator for the project, Ateknea selected ASSIST based on their broad experience in software development and complex technical solutions.\nPartnership with ASSIST\u00a0has lasted since a year and a half, time in which we have worked together to several projects of e-commerce portals. The communication with ASSIST Team was very good, taking in count the distance between us. ASSIST\u00a0Team has always made available intermediary results, to closely watch the project's evolution. We are very pleased of our partner's results.\nASSIST\u00a0Software represents our IT partner from few years. In all this time, ASSIST Team has designed and improved Accountant application, setting up and maintaining in the same time our communication system. We are very satisfied of our collaboration. They have offered us efficient solutions for our business using Accountant. Implementing a well adapted system communication for our organization requirements, they have proved a lot of flexibility to our wishes.\nMy collaboration with ASSIST has begun in the last two years, at the time when I was looking for a team of programmers to implement a project for document management, which we have conceived. ASSIST\u00a0Team has understood the exact meaning of what I was expected from this project, the communication being excellent. Our cooperation product is Q-Manager, now already at version 2.0.\nLatest News and Blog Posts from ASSIST\nSuccessful Completion of START Erasmus+ Project\nReimagine your perfect sky with a great weather and cloud Unity asset\nDiscover the software you use but rarely think about\nAI Unveiled: Open Doors ASSIST 2023 - Empowering Tomorrow's Tech Leaders\nMeet the 3 innovative minds attending CES 24\nUnlock the Power of Romanian Software Development at CES 2024\nWhat will CES 2024 bring?

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Be a part of the innovation and disruption with us\nMon, 18 Dec 2023\nIf 2023 will forever be remembered as \u201dthe year of AI\u201d, what will 2024 bring? As the world ponders what tech will put before us next, to learn first about the new trends that will affect us all, you must stand beside industry pioneers and innovative minds in what is arguably the most powerful technology conference in the world.\nWhat is CES (Consumers Electronics Show)?\nUnder the motto \u201dAll together. All on\u201d, CES brings together various stakeholders from the consumer technology industry, including manufacturers, developers, suppliers, and content providers. It also hosts a thought-provoking conference program where industry leaders and innovators engage in discussions on the most pressing issues shaping the future of technology.\nWhen is CES 2024?\nCES 2024 will take place in Las Vegas from the 9th to the 12th of January, and thousands of exhibitors have already registered for the chance to network, learn, discuss, and analyze what 2024 will look like for businesses worldwide and household consumers.\nASSIST Software at CES 2024\nAfter an incredible year when we challenged ourselves and consistently exceeded expectations, we will be present at CES 2024. ASSIST Software will be one of the companies exhibiting alongside past and present partners. This year's featured exhibitors include Caterpillar, Google, Hyundai, IBM, Intel, Lenovo, Samsung and Sony.\nVisit our booking website.\nWhy is ASSIST Software at CES 2024?\nWith a clean track record for innovation and a constant focus on professional development, ASSIST Software has the expertise to take on projects from all over the world and offer skills that go beyond writing good, clean code in various languages.\nHowever, around 63% of exhibitors at CES are from the US. Can a company from #Romania compete with other domestic bespoke software solutions?\nWe work incredibly well with our partners, no matter the time zone, as Julia Turc, co-founder at Storia AI declared when asked about the way we collaborated with her business in New York:\n\u201dASSIST Software was instrumental in building an end-to-end prototype for our product. They delivered the project in an incredibly tight timeline, and were\u00a0very\u00a0graceful to accommodate for changes and new feature requests in the middle of the engagement.
