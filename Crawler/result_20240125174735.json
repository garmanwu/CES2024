The company's next-gen automotive thermal camera will be exclusively featured at the Gentex Corporation booth, which follows last year's announcement of a collaboration agreement with Gentex to help commercialize ADASKY's technology.\nADASKY's proprietary LWIR (Long Wave Infrared) sensors are becoming well-known in the industry for their market-leading performance based on their superior size-to-performance ratio, solid state technology, high reliability, and \"shutterless\" constant-operation design. As advanced sensing systems create the path for passenger and pedestrian safety, thermal sensing will fill the existing gaps in that technology so that ADAS and vision-based systems can operate more reliably in low light and in all-weather situations.\n\"Showcasing our technology at\u00a0CES marks a significant milestone for ADASKY,\" said ADASKY CEO Yakov Shaharabani. \"Our collaboration with Gentex is more than a partnership; it's an industry-leading fusion of expertise and innovation. Together, we're developing the future of automotive safety, enhancing driver perception, and ensuring reliability under any driving condition.\"\nIn May of 2023, ADASKY and Gentex established a commercial, engineering, and manufacturing collaboration agreement designed to help bring ADASKY's proprietary technology to market. The partnership is focused on helping ADASKY scale from early growth company to a global leader in thermal sensing.\n\"Gentex has a 50-year history in sensing technology,\" said Gentex President and CEO Steve Downing. \"Our partnership with ADASKY adds thermal capabilities to our sensing toolbox. Our goal is to not only help ADASKY commercialize its technology for existing automotive applications, but also find opportunities to integrate thermal into current and future Gentex products in all the markets we serve.\"\nOne such product integration opportunity is with Gentex's industry-leading Full Display Mirror\u00ae\u00a0(FDM\u00ae), an intelligent rear-vision system that uses a custom camera and mirror-integrated video display to optimize a vehicle's rearward view. At CES, Gentex will debut ADASKY's thermal sensing technology in an FDM, the first application of thermal technology in a digital rearview mirror. The inclusion of a rearward-facing thermal camera in an FDM system could dramatically improve the driver's ability to monitor the rearward scene during nighttime driving and identify potential hazards while reversing.\nForward- and rearward-facing applications of ADASKY's thermal technology will be on exhibit in an interactive kiosk and demonstrator vehicle at the Gentex booth. Customer test drives will also be available.\nCES is an annual exhibition organized by the Consumer Technology Association. The event showcases the latest advancements and upcoming products in the field of consumer electronics. CES 2024 runs January 9-12 in Las Vegas.\u00a0ADASKY technologies will be on display at the Gentex booth in the Las Vegas Convention Center, West Hall, booth #6440.\nFounded in 1974, Gentex Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ: GNTX) is a supplier of automatic-dimming rearview mirrors and electronics to the automotive industry, dimmable aircraft windows for aviation markets, and fire protection products to the fire protection market. Check out some of the Company's latest technology at www.gentex.com.\nADASKY develops and manufactures intelligent, high-resolution thermal sensing systems (LWIR) for vehicle safety and perception applications and smart city roadway solutions.

Over the past year, Gentex has initiated new R&D activities, established new collaboration agreements, expanded through strategic acquisition, and diversified its product lines. All of this and more will be demonstrated at the Gentex CES booth through interactive displays, feature-integrated vehicles, and product simulators that enable customers to experience the technology in a realistic setting.\nGentex is a long-time supplier of electro-optical products for the global automotive, aerospace, and fire protection industries. It\u2019s best known for supplying nearly every major automaker with connected-car technologies and advanced electronic features that optimize driver vision and enhance driver safety.\n\u201c2024 marks not only a golden milestone of 50 years in business, but also a year of groundbreaking achievements and unparalleled innovation,\u201d said Steve Downing, Gentex chief executive officer. \u201cAt this year\u2019s CES, we\u2019re showcasing new advancements in nearly every product category and providing an advanced look at PLACE, our first direct-to-consumer, smart-home sensing product.\u201d\nPLACE Smart Smoke/CO Detection\nGentex has over 50 years of experience in the commercial fire protection industry. Now the company is preparing to introduce a line of smart home devices called PLACE, an innovative suite of smart home safety products with room-specific functionality. PLACE will be a holistic solution that blends smart home safety, comfort, and security features into one sophisticated system, all controlled from a single, user-friendly app.\n\u201cPLACE is Gentex\u2019s stride toward creating a safer home environment, delivering trusted, industry-leading sensing technology,\u201d said Gentex Chief Technology Officer Neil Boehm. \u201cEvery household can expect the highest standard of comfort, security, and convenience that Gentex has delivered to our commercial fire protection customers for the past five decades, but with the connected functionality that consumers expect in their devices today.\u201d\nThe PLACE portfolio of smart-home solutions is being designed to address the nuanced safety requirements of various home spaces. The base Any Space unit is perfect for any location in the home, providing smart smoke and carbon monoxide detection and Wi-Fi connectivity for space-specific alerts. The system\u2019s versatility is further demonstrated through specialized units for the kitchen, nursery, and garage, each equipped with additional safeguards like gas and VOC detection, room-monitoring cameras, intercoms, and temperature and humidity sensing.\nThe PLACE lineup will be on display in an interactive exhibit at the Gentex CES booth. The company is currently working on a product launch strategy with various retailers, with the product set to debut later this year.\nADASKY Thermal Imaging\nAlso at CES this year, Gentex will showcase its latest strategic partnership with ADASKY, which is aimed at advancing the company\u2019s unique thermal imaging technology for the automotive industry. Gentex announced a collaboration agreement with ADASKY in May 2023.\n\"After thorough investigation and ongoing discussions with ADASKY, we recognized the opportunity to enhance and expedite the development and market introduction of ADASKY's thermal imaging technology. Our strategy of continually expanding our sensing capabilities is furthered by the incorporation of ADASKY's innovative tech into our product portfolio,\" said Boehm.\nADASKY\u2019s proprietary LWIR (Long Wave Infrared) sensors are becoming well-known in the industry for their market-leading performance based on their superior size-to-performance ratio, solid state technology, high reliability, and \u201cshutterless\u201d constant-operation design. As advanced sensing systems create the path for passenger and pedestrian safety, thermal sensing will fill the existing gaps in that technology so that ADAS and vision-based systems can operate more reliably in low light and in all-weather situations.\nGentex\u2019s booth will debut not only forward-facing applications of ADASKY\u2019s technology, but also, for the first time ever, the integration of thermal imaging in a Gentex Full Display Mirror (FDM), the industry\u2019s leading digital rearview mirror. The inclusion of a rearward-facing thermal camera in an FDM system could dramatically improve the driver\u2019s ability to monitor the rearward scene during nighttime driving and help identify potential hazards while reversing.\nForward- and rearward-facing applications of ADASKY\u2019s thermal technology will be on exhibit in an interactive kiosk and demonstrator vehicle at the Gentex booth. Test drives will also be available.\nDriver and In-Cabin Monitoring\nEuropean Union General Safety Regulations will soon require that cars sold in Europe be equipped with a driver monitoring system (DMS). Subsequently, Gentex has ongoing DMS development programs with multiple automakers.\nOn display in a vehicle demonstrator at CES will be Gentex\u2019s mirror-integrated DMS, which tracks driver head pose, eye gaze, and other metrics to determine distraction, drowsiness, sudden sickness, and return of manual control in semi-autonomous vehicles. The system can expand to include 2D and structured-light-based 3D cabin monitoring for detecting passengers, behavior, objects, and even presence of life.\nIntegrating DMS in the rearview mirror provides the camera with an optimal view of the driver and vehicle occupants, while affording automakers a high-performance, cross-platform DMS solution. New this year at CES is a Gentex driver monitoring solution integrated into a Full Display Mirror, the industry\u2019s leading digital rearview mirror.\nDigital Vision\nGentex\u2019s Full Display Mirror (FDM) combines a custom camera and mirror-integrated video display for enhanced rearward visibility. Launched just seven years ago, the FDM is currently offered on over 25 different brands and 100 different vehicles around the world. The versatile FDM platform offers add-on features like a Digital Video Recorder (DVR), scalable trailer cam system, touch screen display, and integrated side blind zone alerts.
