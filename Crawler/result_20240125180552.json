The Kia Connected HomeTM is a testament to the power of living with an electric vehicle, featuring immersive demonstrations of the all-electric Kia EV9\u2019s bidirectional vehicle-to-home (V2H)1 charging capabilities and the EV6\u2019s onboard power generator (V2L)2 functionality.\n\u201cOur presence at CES is an opportunity to inform and inspire consumers about the transformative advantages of incorporating electrification into their home lives, powered by Kia vehicles,\u201d said Steven Center, COO and EVP, Kia America. \u201cKia\u2019s Plan S commitment to advancing sustainable mobility takes shape at CES through demonstrations of versatile applications of V2H technology.\u201d\nThe Kia Connected HomeTM is designed to be a sensory journey that takes CES visitors through elements of sight, sound, taste and touch, with various activations that highlight Kia\u2019s design philosophy and use of new, innovative materials inspired by nature. Designed with sharp, flowing lines that resemble the Kia logo, the Kia Connected HomeTM reflects the design philosophy of Opposites United, which takes inspiration from contrasts found in nature and humanity. The front yard features the recently unveiled Concept EV3 and Concept EV4 models on display, while an interactive EV9 simulator offers visitors the opportunity to experience the all-electric SUV without leaving the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nFrom the Road to Your Residence: Vehicle-to-Home Integration\nAs the first Kia EV to support V2H capabilities, in the future, the 2024 EV9 could offer the transformative potential to unlock bidirectional charging for properly equipped homes. At the Kia Connected HomeTM, the EV9 will be connected to the Wallbox Quasar 2 (coming in the future), an innovative, 11.5-kW DC charger that is expected to facilitate bidirectional charging and the ability for the EV9 to act as a mobile power source. Quasar 2 is designed to automatically initiate charging once plugged into the EV9 and, in the event of a power outage, can switch the direction of charging to draw power from the EV9 into the home3. With a battery capacity ranging from 76.1 to 99.8 kWh, the EV9\u2019s battery pack alone surpasses a standard home energy storage system (13.5 kWh) five times over, potentially enabling an EV9 to sustain a typical household\u2019s energy consumption for up to several days. Once grid power is restored, the Quasar 2 is designed to automatically switch back to charging the EV9. Once available, the Quasar 2 can also intelligently identify opportunities for the EV9 to supply power to the home, at times of high electricity rates.\nAround the corner from the EV9 V2H simulation, an EV6 exhibits the benefits of V2L technology. V2L also enables the EV6 to supply up to 1,900 watts of power to certain electrical appliances, devices, tools, or recreational equipment.\nTransported to Seoul: EV9 Driving Simulation\nTaking cues from Kia\u2019s award-winning Unplugged Ground experience in Seoul, the Kia Connected HomeTM features an immersive test drive simulator. Unlike a traditional simulator experience, the Kia Connected HomeTM utilizes an actual EV9 and places the visitor in the driver\u2019s seat directly. First-person perspective 3D video displayed on the screens creates the sensation of driving while the turntable communicates with the content server through network connections, enabling a seamless simulation experience.\nDuring a 15-minute experience inside the Kia Connected HomeTM, visitors can experience new Kia in-vehicle technologies, including Highway Driving Assist 2 (HDA-2)4 and Remote Smart Parking Assist 2 (RSPA-2)5. HDA-2 is a driver convenience system that helps to maintain a predetermined distance from the vehicle detected in front, keep the vehicle within detected lane markers on certain highways, and assist in lane changes under certain conditions. RSPA-2 allows remote parking in, or exiting from, certain parking spots with the driver operating the EV9 from outside the vehicle, as well as smart parking while the driver is inside the vehicle.\nJuxtaposing Nature and Technology: Concept EV3 and Concept EV4\nThe Kia Connected HomeTM also introduces the \u201c10 Must-Have Items\u201d that are essential to Kia\u2019s strategy for color, material and finish (CMF). A curated display invites showgoers to explore the materials the brand envisions in its upcoming models, such as bioplastic produced from biomass sources such as vegetable oils, corn extract, sawdust and sugarcane, and bio polyurethane as a replacement for animal-based leather.\n\u201cIn the realm of design, sustainability is not just a choice\u2014it's a powerful statement,\u201d said Tom Kearns, chief designer, Kia Design Center America. \u201cIt's about creating beauty with a purpose, where every material tells a story of responsible innovation and lasting impact.\"\nThese materials are integral to the interiors of the all-electric Concept EV3 and Concept EV4 on display outside the Kia Connected HomeTM. The Concept EV3 compact crossover offers the technology, practicality, and design of Kia\u2019s flagship SUV, the EV9, with a high degree of inspiration from the \u201cJoy for Reason\u201d pillar of the Opposites United design philosophy. The Concept EV3 gives a strong impression with a unique silhouette defined by a sloping roofline, disconnected C pillar that links the glasshouse surfaces with a floating roof effect, and robust squared wheel arches cut with asymmetrical angles. Inside, the Concept EV3 creates an ambience that promotes emotional wellbeing with soft mood lighting and ultra-clean dashboard surfacing, with the advanced ergonomic seat designs comprised of natural fiber structures to deliver a lightweight, slimmer seat design.\nThe Concept EV4 represents the purity of the \u201cPower to Progress\u201d pillar of the Opposites United design philosophy. An entirely new type of EV sedan that stands as a symbol of innovation, it\u2019s brought to life through a harmonious blend of geometric diagonal character lines and rich yet technical surfaces. Its dramatic proportions are reminiscent of sports and racing cars and showcase Kia\u2019s determination to push design boundaries. The cocoonlike interior features a sleek and spacious horizontal layout with an innovative HVAC user interface and pin-style air vents that can change patterns. Handwoven fabric stripes applied to the vehicle\u2019s storage area and dashboard create a 3D effect. Materiality also looms large in the interior of the Concept EV4 through the implementation of natural dyes and recycled cotton.\nGoing \u201cBeyond Mobility:\u201d Kia PBV Strategy\nAt a separate event ahead of the opening of the Kia Connected HomeTM, Kia set the stage at CES with an exhibition of five \u201cPlatform Beyond Vehicles\u201d (PBV) concept models, showcasing the diverse potential of the future. As part of a multi-phase PBV roadmap, an all-new modular vehicle previewed by the Concept PBV A utilizes an \u201cEasy Swap\u201d technology designed to meet diverse customer needs. The vision for this technology is to enable a single vehicle chassis to serve various purposes with interchangeable modules connected to the base vehicle via a hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling. The idea behind the \u201cDynamic Hybrid\u201d PBV modular body assembly is to help facilitate quick and straightforward in-field transformations, allowing the PBV A to shift from a daytime taxi, to a nighttime delivery van, to a personal recreational vehicle for the weekends. Concept PBV B is the largest product in the line-up, defined by more interior space, increased driving range, and enhanced functionalities, and the smaller PBV C concept is optimized for agile and short-distance logistics transportation, using corner modules to minimize turning radius even in narrow spaces.\nKia America \u2013 about us\nHeadquartered in Irvine, California, Kia America continues to top automotive quality surveys.

        "raw_content": "Kia reinvents the van with its electric Platform Beyond Vehicles\nKia wants to build EVs that can be easily reconfigured for different uses, ranging from ordinary passenger cars to taxis and delivery vehicles. The automaker previewed this strategy, called the Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV), at CES 2024, showing the first potential vehicle designs.\nAll PBV derivatives will be based on a modular platform with a fixed cab, but all bodywork aft of the cab will be interchangeable, allowing the same vehicle to serve as a taxi during the day, a delivery van at night, and a personal car on weekends, Kia says. If this sounds familiar, it\u2019s because Kia first mentioned the PBV strategy in April 2023, but at that time, the acronym stood for \u201cPurpose-Built Vehicle.\u201d\nThe rear bodywork, which Kia calls the \u201clife module,\u201d is connected to the chassis via electromagnetic and mechanical couplings. These modules will be shipped in kit form and designed to be easily assembled outside a factory setting. Kia says they\u2019ll incorporate features like large doors to make ingress and egress easy, adding that the basic EV platform creates a large flat floor ideal for stowing cargo.\nAt CES, Kia showed the Concept PV5, previewing the first planned PBV production model. Kia plans to offer \u201cbasic,\u201d van, high roof, and chassis cab configurations, as well as a self-driving version for a planned autonomous ride-hailing service from Motional, a joint venture between Kia parent Hyundai and autonomous-driving tech firm Aptiv.\nThe PV5 will be followed by a larger model called the PV7 and a smaller model called the PV1. They\u2019ll be built at a dedicated factory in Hwaseong, South Korea, that\u2019s scheduled to open in 2025 and will be able to build 150,000 vehicles per year, according to Kia.\nIn addition to the vehicles themselves, Kia hopes to create an aftermarket ecosystem of accessories that can be mounted on a standardized rail system built into the ceiling, floor, and side panels of the vehicles. According to Kia, this can accommodate everything from cabinets and shelves to speakers, and the automaker plans to contract with conversion shops in different markets to install them. There will also be bundles of software, including fleet management systems for the commercial operators likely to use the PBVs in their delivery van, taxi, and autonomous ride-hailing configurations.\nThe multiple body styles, range of accessories installed by third-party firms, and fleet-management software all seem borrowed from the commercial van market. But commercial vans also seem like a better model for the delivery vehicles and ride-hailing of the future than the hodgepodge of sedans and SUVs doing the majority of Uber or GrubHub runs today.\nTo date, electric vehicles have cost considerably more than their gasoline-powered counterparts, but that\u2019s finally changing. Every year, more and more inexpensive EVs are hitting the market and, with the help of local, state, and federal tax credits and rebates (if available), many of them now sell for well below the 2023 median car price of $48,000.\nIf you're a budget-conscious buyer, that number is probably little consolation. However, there are a lot of good options for closer to $30,000 and below -- if you know where to look. That's why we've put together this guide. Here's a list of the nine most affordable electric vehicles available right now, ranked from cheapest to most expensive. Note that we're only including vehicles that are available in the U.S.\nElectric cars aren't just an opportunity for automakers to be friendlier to the planet. They're an opportunity to try something new. That's what Volvo is doing with its new EX30 crossover SUV.\nThe EX30 essentially represents a third stage of evolution for Volvo's EVs. The Swedish automaker started with the XC40 Recharge and C40 Recharge, two EVs based on an existing internal-combustion architecture. It then showed the EX90, which was designed from the ground up as an EV, but in the image of the gasoline-powered Volvo XC90. Now, we get to see what an EV can look like with all the gasoline baggage shed.\n2024 BMW i5 BMW\nThe new 2024 BMW 5 Series is two cars in one. On one hand, there's the eighth-generation gasoline-powered sedan that will represent the bulk of sales in most markets. On the other hand, for the first time in the nameplate's long history, there's an electric version called i5.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

        "raw_content": "Kia Announced PBV Line-Up Business at CES 2024\nby Jose Antonio LopezJan 8, 2024All News, CES 2024, Kia, Slider0 comments\nKia has revealed its Platform Beyond Vehicle (PBV) future strategy at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. Kia\u2019s PBV business will initially be based around the introduction of an all-new, modular vehicle, previewed by the Kia Concept PV5. This future vision was presented alongside a multi-phase plan with the goal of PBVs revolutionizing the mobility industry while helping to advance Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s ambitions in robotics, Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), and autonomous driving.\nKia PBVs are intended to be a total mobility solution that combines fit-for-purpose EVs with advanced software solutions based on the Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s software-to-everything, or SDx, strategy. As a Platform Beyond Vehicle, Kia PBVs are designed to open the door to new businesses and lifestyles by redefining the concept of space thanks to advanced, tailored interiors that provide freedom and flexibility. \u201cKia\u2019s PBV business represents our vision of going beyond the traditional concept of automobiles by fulfilling the unmet needs of diverse customers and communities through optimized vehicles and services catering to specific market and business circumstances,\u201d said Ho Sung Song, Kia Corporation President and CEO.\nA vision for future mobility The launch of Kia\u2019s PBV business will see the brand commit to providing a varied range of customized vehicle types to meet customers\u2019 individual requirements. Determined to overcome existing restrictive and one-dimensional industry product line-up offerings, Kia believes its new approach to PBVs can help solve various mobility challenges encountered by individuals and organizations with limited transportation options.\nKia\u2019s PBV offering will be built around a dedicated business system, integrating vehicles, software, and future technologies to deliver added value. The brand\u2019s PBV roadmap, divided into three distinct phases, illustrates how Kia PBVs will be pivotal in realizing the Group\u2019s SDx vision as devices that offer tailored solutions according to customer usage patterns. In phase one, Kia plans to introduce the Kia PV5, a versatile EV optimized for major domains such as hailing, delivery and utilities that features conversion capability for diverse customer needs.\nEnhanced data connectivity between vehicles and external data such as route or delivery information is intended to enable convenient operation of multiple vehicles as a software-defined fleet. The plan for phase two is to see the completion of the dedicated PBV model line-up, with PBVs evolving into AI-based mobility platforms that use data to interact with users and help keep vehicles updated. An integrated PBV solution can help provide a customized, seamless experience across devices and software.\nIn phase three, Kia PBVs are expected to evolve into highly customizable, bespoke mobility solutions by integrating with the future mobility ecosystem. Designed to make users\u2019 lives easier Utilizing technology to flexibly address the diverse demands of customers, the design strategy is to enable a single vehicle chassis to be used to fulfill multiple mobility needs.\nBehind a fixed cab, or \u2018driver zone\u2019, a variety of interchangeable upper bodies, or \u2018life modules\u2019, can be connected to the base vehicle via a hybrid electromagnetic and mechanical coupling technology, turning the PBV into a taxi during the day, to a delivery van at night, and a personal recreational vehicle on weekends. The weldless body structure assembly is designed to enable the length of moveable members to be flexibly adjusted according to vehicle use purpose. Shipped in standardized, convenient kit form, Dynamic Hybrid technology is intended to allow for the quick and simple in-field transformation of a Kia PV5.\nThe design of Kia\u2019s PBVs is inspired by robust, simple and clever tools and goes beyond mere aesthetics. Kia\u2019s mission is to design PBVs that are simple and intuitive to operate and engage with, regardless of where, when or how they are used. Whether the purpose of the vehicle is to transport people, move goods, or meet logistics or personal mobility needs, Kia\u2019s goal is to ensure each PBV shares a consistent quality of design that reflects its solid, robust nature and projects a dependable and highly capable attitude.\nA combination of a simple yet robust surface language combined with expressive graphics seamlessly unifies the four Concept PV5 models, despite their diverse natures. On each vehicle, large doors open out to reveal an exceptionally accommodating pillarless opening that provides easy ingress and egress. Inside, the extended wheelbase and electric platform ensure wide, flat open spaces to offer stowage and usage possibilities. Inspiration becomes reality Kia plans to create an ecosystem that fosters interaction between PBVs.\nWith extensive modularity \u2014 including the ability to share features across all vehicles \u2014 Kia hopes its PBVs will enhance versatility, opening up possibilities to cater to the needs of both businesses and individuals. In line with phase one, Kia plans to make various versions of the PV5 available in the future, including Basic, Van, High Roof, and Chassis Cab. In the future, Kia also plans to introduce a Robotaxi model developed with Motional (a joint venture between HMG and Aptiv), which aims to provide a revolutionary autonomous hailing experience for passengers.\nDuring phase two, symbiosis of the PBV ecosystem will be complimented by two further models, the \u2018PV7\u2019 and \u2018PV1\u2019, utilizing cabinet and frame systems to enhance interaction and connectivity among vehicles based on the modular concept.\n1) PV7 \u2014 The largest product in the PBV line-up, designed with more interior space, impressive driving range, and enhanced functionalities.\n2) PV1 \u2014 The smallest product in the line-up, PV1 is designed for agile and short- distance logistics transportation, using driving modules to minimize turning radius even in narrow spaces.\n3) PBV modularity \u2014 An integrated rail system on the vehicle\u2019s ceiling, floor, and side panels, as well as on the exterior, enables customization of the vehicle to meet individual customer needs. This system is designed to enable the seamless transfer of goods and items between vehicles, using cabinets and frames. The \u2018rails\u2019 within this ecosystem simplify the movement of items between vehicles, while the modular design of the \u2018tiles\u2019 and functional accessories, such as speakers and shelves, offer limitless flexibility for a wide range of scenarios.\n\u201cKia PBVs will initiate a new era of seamless everyday business and lifestyle solutions. We hope to make our customers\u2019 lives easier and better, whether they\u2019re stationary or on the move, offering exceptional flexibility and customization through radical modularization,\u201d said Karim Habib, Executive Vice President and Head of Kia Global Design. To take full advantage of the opportunities enabled by PBVs, Kia plans to launch a dedicated business system, encapsulating various aspect of the process, from the product line-up to integration of software solutions, and global partnerships.\nThe product line-up outlined above will be augmented by the introduction of a customer participation-based development process, utilizing customer input and feedback to create more tailored, mission-specific solutions. Kia is taking significant steps to meet the diverse demands of customers by constructing a PBV-dedicated EVO plant in Autoland Hwaseong, Korea. This factory will implement a hybrid production approach, combining conveyor and cell-based methods. Through collaboration with global conversion partners, Kia will be able to offer conversion models for various PBV line-ups, catering to different customer preferences.\nThe factory is scheduled to become operational in 2025 and is expected to have an annual capacity of 150,000 units. The brand\u2019s solutions for In-Vehicle Infotainment (IVI), Fleet Management Systems (FMS), and charging aims to leverage vehicle software-based data and AI technologies to further enable customer-centric solutions, predictive maintenance suggestions to reduce downtime, and charging programs tailored to the customer\u2019s business operating environment. Kia\u2019s PBV IVI solution aims to enhance daily life by recognizing user preferences in real-time and providing relevant contextual data. It is expected to offer access to the Kia PBV App Market and third-party apps, allowing customers have information and entertainment content on the go.\nBy connecting with business-specific apps previously limited to mobile devices, it seeks to improve service convenience and information reliability, providing a holistic user experience across different hardware form factors. The fleet management solution for Kia PBVs will be designed to allow customers to efficiently oversee multiple vehicles, providing insights on sales, inventory, and deliveries, benefiting mobility and logistics businesses. Features may include inventory monitoring, temperature control, and intelligent route planning for efficiency.\nThe solution is intended to streamline fleet management with real-time data and AI integration for predictive maintenance and optimal operational efficiency. Kia\u2019s EV charging solution will be designed to optimize charging schedules by considering battery charge levels, routes, schedules, and breaks. Additionally, Kia aims to provide a total energy solution by utilizing advanced charging infrastructure, allowing high-density energy batteries to power mobile devices and emergency equipment. This can eventually be made possible through innovations like Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) technology. This integration of IVI, FMS, and charging systems is expected to be delivered via unified software, enabling packaged solutions adaptable to various business environments.\nKia has established partnerships with companies like Uber, Coupang, CJ Logistics, Kakao Mobility, and Dubai Taxi Corporation to further enhance its PBV-dedicated business system. \u201cThe Kia PBV business is the pinnacle of our customer-centric business approach. With the aim of developing PBVs and solutions tailored to their business environments, we are confident that these strong partnerships will be a driving force on the road to becoming a sustainable mobility solutions provider,\u201d said Pierre-Martin Bos, Vice President and Director of PBV.\nFuture business and affiliate partnerships may help strengthen the integration of robotics, AAM, and autonomous driving to support a PBV mobility solution within smart city environments.\n1) Robotics \u2014 Kia is leveraging robotics, including Boston Dynamics\u2019 Stretch and Spot robots, to enhance logistics automation and round-the-clock quality control at their smart factories. These efforts aim to uncover new business opportunities through collaborations and drive innovation.\n2) AAM \u2014 Kia is collaborating with Hyundai Motor Group affiliate Supernal, to expedite the development of smart cities by introducing multi-modal services and mobility hub businesses based on advanced air mobility.\n3) Autonomous driving \u2014 together with Motional, Hyundai Motor Group plans to expand beyond personal autonomous driving technology into the business phase. This is underway with plans for the development of a software based PV5 Robotaxi. This collaboration aims to combine Kia\u2019s competitive strengths with Motional\u2019s advanced Level 4 autonomous driving technology to expand global business opportunities. As such, Hyundai Motor Group\u2019s software capabilities transcend beyond vehicles and extend to various areas of mobility, such as robotics, aircraft, and autonomous driving, aiming to enable operation, control, and management, fostering an era of hyper-connectedness between people and things.\nKia\u2019s PBV models can redefine how customers live their lives. Boundary-pushing design can lead to creating new vehicle interiors and can eventually expand to both mobile and stationary spaces, enhancing daily life, work, and leisure. Since the brand\u2019s relaunch in 2021, Kia has embarked on a journey to adapt effectively to the rapidly changing market through its Plan S strategy.\nWith award-winning models including the EV6 and EV9 having helped to successfully establish the company as a leader in the design and manufacture of EVs, Kia aims to solidify its position as a top-tier sustainable mobility solutions provider through the launch of subsequent vehicles, such as the EV3, and EV4. In pursuit of achieving its vision and meeting diverse customer needs, Kia\u2019s brand relaunch has led additionally to a transition towards a sustainable customer- centric management system.\nLeading the way Kia\u2019s presence at CES 2024 marks a return to the industry-leading Consumer Electronics Show after a five-year absence. The brand will be presenting two exhibitions at the event. Located in the LVCC West Hall, Kia\u2019s PBV exhibition is based on the theme \u2018Place of Inspiration\u2019. The exhibition showcases the diverse ways in which PBVs can inspire and shape individuals\u2019 lives through a range of lifestyle and experience displays and features five PBV concept vehicles. The four display areas take the form of visual representations of a park, city, home and factory bathed in four visually distinctive colors.\nTogether, the displays highlight the multiple applications and benefits of Kia\u2019s PBV technology in addition to showcasing Kia\u2019s brand values and \u2018Opposites United\u2019 design philosophy. Kia\u2019s second exhibition is located in the CES Central Plaza, under the theme of \u2018EV Life for Everyone.\u2019 Featuring a futuristic Kia Connected Home\u2122, the display showcases the Kia Concept EV3, Concept EV4 and the EV6 and EV9 production models, in addition to an exciting EV9 driving technology simulation, a 10 innovative items exhibition, and Vehicle-to- Home (V2H) power supply (coming in the future) and Vehicle-to-Load (V2L) camping demonstrations.\nKia Tasman Pickup Spied with Production Body\nUS-Spec 2024 Santa Fe Priced From $33,950\nHyundai IONIQ 7 Spied Almost Done\nKia EV2: Revolutionizing the Compact SUV Market with All-Electric Innovation\nKOREAN CAR BLOG TV\nIt\u2019s all about the Korean automakers Hyundai, Kia & Genesis.
