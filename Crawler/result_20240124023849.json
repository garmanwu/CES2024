        "raw_content": "SAN FRANCISCO, CA - For 40 years Moore\u2019s Law has accurately determined the rate of scaling in semiconductor devices. The International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS) has, in the last 14 years, had the job of determining what technologies are required to keep on the Moore\u2019s Law technology curve.The two will intersect at SEMICON West 2005, when the ITRS holds a public conference to solicit feedback for its 2005 update.\nThe ITRS technology working groups meet three times a year.in Europe, the U.S. and Asia.and each gathering coincides with a SEMICON exposition. Public meetings are usually held in the same timeframe to solicit feedback from non-ITRS participants. Such a public meeting is scheduled for July 13 at SEMICON West 2005. \u201cWithout [the SEMICON expos] we wouldn\u2019t get near the attendance in terms of people coming to the public meetings,\u201d said Robert R. Doering, cochair of International Roadmap Committee.\nUp to 200 people in 16 groups are expected to participate in 2.days of workshops held prior to the public conference. The discussions, and public feedback from the conference, will form the basis for the 2005 ITRS update published in December.\nDoering, who is a senior fellow, silicon technology development, at Texas Instruments, explained that the ITRS roadmap provides a \u201csnapshot of the current thinking of a pretty big group of people.\u201d About 1,000 worldwide are involved in the process.This level of participation \u201cmeans you are getting something that has broad base of support, a worldwide consensus,\u201d said Doering. \u201cOn the other hand, it tends to be a little more conservative than what you would get if you pulled a small group of visionaries together,\u201d he added. \u201cHopefully it strikes a good balance.\u201d\nThe roadmap has been a part of the industry since 1987, but wasn\u2019t always international. It started out as a national program focused on U.S. technology needs. As the semiconductor industry became more international during the 1990s, it became apparent that a roadmap just for the U.S. wouldn\u2019t be representative.\nAfter going international, the next step was to involve the technology providers in the process.\u201cWe took a hard look at whether we had good distribution in terms of equipment and materials suppliers involved in the process,\u201d said Doering. As well as including device makers and suppliers, the ITRS sought input from universities and government researchers. The result? \u201cIt seems like they have gotten to the point where they (all sides) discuss issues and have a good process for consensus,\u201d said Doering.\nWith the cost of some new chip making tools reaching tens of millions of dollars, economic issues are also now debated within some of the working groups, especially those concerned with lithography and IC test. Doering said that the ITRS hasn\u2019t yet determined how to use the economic data other than to influence \u201cour gut feeling. \u201cLooking at the economic factors is a first step,\u201d he added.\nWhat\u2019s different now is that there\u2019s more discussion from a top down level on how to include economic constraints in the roadmap process, explained Doering. \u201cWe try and get more trends on our radar screen that have to do with the overall economics of the industry\u2026how we turn that kind of raw data into something that can help us determine what the technology of the future might look like.\u201d\nThe day after the public meeting, Doering will give a keynote address as part of the \u201cVoices of the Industry\u201d presentations at SEMICON West 2005. Doering said his keynote will emphasize the need for the industry to pay more attention to the long range technology outlook. To that end, the ITRS has introduced one new \u201cchapter,\u201d focusing on the area of emerging research devices.\nIn the short term, Doering believes high-k gate dielectrics will remain a challenge for the semiconductor industry.\u201c Will we be able to find something that is substantially better than the best we have today, which tends to be the nitrides and oxides? That\u2019s the biggest single [challenge],\u201d he said.\nDoering also believes that the limits to scaling CMOS will not arise from a shortage of ideas on how to get to smaller dimensions. Rather, \u201cit will just be that it doesn\u2019t make any sense to do that from a business point of view.\u201d\nThe ITRS is sponsored by the European Semiconductor Industry Association (ESIA), the Japan Electronics and Information Technology Industries Association (JEITA), the Korean Semiconductor Industry Association (KSIA), the Semiconductor Industry Association (SIA), and Taiwan Semiconductor Industry Association (TSIA). International SEMATECH is responsible for global coordination for ITRS activities."

The survey captured insights from 172 semiconductor executives about their outlook for the industry in 2024 and beyond. More than half of the respondents were from companies with more than $1 billion in annual revenue.\nThe Semiconductor Industry Confidence Index score is 54 for the upcoming year (a value above 50 indicates a more positive outlook than negative). This is similar to last year (56), yet still lower than each of the previous five years. The primary drivers are the somewhat muted outlooks for workforce growth, research and development (R&D) spending, and capital expenditures.

In Q3 2023, electronics sales are projected to post healthy quarter-on-quarter growth of 10%, while memory IC sales are expected to log double-digit growth for the first time since the downturn started in Q3 2022. Logic IC sales are predicted to remain stable and improve as demand gradually recovers.\nHeadwinds will continue for the semiconductor manufacturing sector in the second half of the year, SEMI and TechInsights reported. Drawdowns of high inventory at integrated device manufacturer (IDM) and fabless companies will continue to suppress fab utilization rates to much lower levels than those in the first half of 2023. The weakness is projected to extend declines in capital equipment billings and silicon shipments for the rest of the year despite stable results in the first half of 2023.\nMarket indicators point to a semiconductor industry bottoming at the end of the first half of 2023, and the industry has since started a recovery, setting the stage for continued growth in 2024. All segments are projected to log year-over-year increases in 2024, with electronics sales surpassing its 2022 peak.\nSources: SEMI (www.semi.org) and TechInsights (www.techinsights.com), August 2023\n\u201cThe slower-than-expected demand recovery will delay the normalization of inventory until the end of 2023, later than we previously anticipated, leading to additional reductions in fab utilization rates in the short term,\u201d said Clark Tseng, Senior Director of Market Intelligence at SEMI. \u201cHowever, recent trends suggest that the worst is over for ICs. We anticipate semiconductor manufacturing will bottom in Q1 2024.\u201d\n\u201cWhile semiconductor markets have seen a sharp downturn the last four quarters, equipment sales and fab construction have been performing much better than expected,\u201d said Boris Metodiev, Director of Market Analysis at TechInsights. \u201cGovernment incentives have been driving new fab projects and strong backlogs have helped equipment sales.\u201d\nThe Semiconductor Manufacturing Monitor (SMM) report provides end-to-end data on the worldwide semiconductor manufacturing industry. The report highlights key trends based on industry indicators including capital equipment, fab capacity, and semiconductor and electronics sales, and includes a capital equipment market forecast. The SMM report also contains two years of quarterly data and a one-quarter outlook for the semiconductor manufacturing supply chain including leading IDM, fabless, foundry, and OSAT companies.
