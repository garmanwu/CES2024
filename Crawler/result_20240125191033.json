Head below for more details.\nNew Victrola Works with Sonos turntable \u2013 Stream Sapphire\nThe new Victrola Stream Sapphire is the latest addition to brand\u2019s lineup of wireless turntables.

The company unveiled the Victrola Stream Sapphire, an audiophile's dream turntable with expanded connectivity options, and the Victrola Automatic, a user-friendly and affordable turntable designed for vinyl enthusiasts.\nThe Victrola Stream Sapphire, positioned as the flagship of their wireless turntable range, builds upon the success of the Stream Carbon from the previous year. It takes wireless playback to the next level by incorporating various connectivity options, making it a standout choice for those seeking a versatile audio experience.\nOne of the remarkable features of the Stream Sapphire is its compatibility with Roon and Sonos, along with UPnP support, allowing users to stream their vinyl records wirelessly throughout their homes without the need for additional equipment.\nThis extends the seamless integration with Sonos network players and opens up possibilities to connect to a broader range of devices, including AV receivers, smart TVs, and UPnP-enabled speakers.\nThe Stream Sapphire also enhances the digital-to-analog conversion quality, offering 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio support. This improvement in audio quality complements its already impressive streaming capabilities. For those who prefer a more traditional setup, the turntable still offers RCA inputs for connecting to analog systems or powered speakers.\nDesigned for both aesthetics and performance, the Stream Sapphire features a low-resonance MDF plinth with a real walnut veneer, adjustable height aluminum feet for self-leveling and isolation, and a two-speed brushless motor. It comes equipped with an Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge attached to a removable headshell and carbon-fiber tonearm, ensuring high-quality sound reproduction.\n\u201cThe Victrola Stream turntable line was created out of a need to provide a seamless, integrated wireless solution to enjoy vinyl no matter where the listener is in their home,\" said Scott Hagen, CEO of Victrola.\n\u201cAfter hearing from both consumers and the integrator community, we recognized an opportunity to build on that promise by opening our ecosystem to include other popular streaming options while also elevating the turntable itself to a level we\u2019ve never introduced in the market before. Victrola Stream Sapphire is a perfectly crafted audiophile-level wireless vinyl solution that meets vinyl purists\u2019 standards while giving integrators the most versatile turntable for any project.\u201d\nThe Victrola Stream Sapphire is expected to be available in Spring 2024, with a price tag of $1,499.99.\nOn the more budget-friendly end of Victrola's new offerings is the Victrola Automatic, a fully automatic turntable designed for ease of use. This turntable simplifies the vinyl listening experience with features that appeal to both newcomers and vinyl enthusiasts.\nThe Victrola Automatic offers a convenient automatic lift-and-lower tonearm function, eliminating the need for manual queueing of records. Additionally, it includes Bluetooth connectivity for wireless playback and introduces a unique \"Repeat\" feature.\nThis feature allows users to continuously replay the same side of a vinyl record, eliminating interruptions and the need for manual tonearm resets during extended listening sessions.\nThe turntable's hardware features a belt-driven design with a fixed headshell and counterweight for a straightforward setup. It also includes a built-in switchable preamp, ensuring compatibility with both wired receiver-based systems and powered speakers. The cartridge used is the Audio-Technica AT-3600L, known for its reliable performance.\n\u201cOur team has been working on a fully automatic turntable design for over three years,\u201d Haagen said. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t going to release it to the market until we had something that looks better, performs better, and is easier to use than any other turntable on the market in its class. Three years later, I\u2019m more than confident to say Victrola has delivered.\u201d\nThe Victrola Automatic is also expected to hit the market in Spring 2024, with a price tag of $199.99.\nRelated posts:\nSubscribe To Home Theater Review\nRecent\nTrending\nAdvertise with UsCustomer Support Editorial Policy Award Licensing"

The new products we\u2019re showing here at CES are some of the best products we\u2019ve ever created, and we\u2019re very excited to share them with our customers and bring them to consumers later this year.\u201d\nVictrola Stream Sapphire ($1,499.99)\nThe Victrola Stream Sapphire builds on Victrola\u2019s flagship Stream Carbon by expanding connectivity. The Sapphire can stream vinyl music to Sonos, UPnP, and Roon integrated systems, as well as support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC Hi-res audio.\nVictrola Automatic ($199.99)\nAs its name implies, this turntable is fully automatic. The Automatic combines ease of use with sleek, modern design. Along with standard play and tonearm lowering/raising functions, Victrola Automatic also offers Bluetooth connectivity, as well as a \u201cRepeat\u201d feature to continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record, which eliminates unwanted pauses and tonearm resets during listening sessions.\nVictrola Rock Speaker Connect ($99.99 each)\nIn addition to turntables, Victrola has a line of Bluetooth speakers. However, their latest entry into this category takes it outside with the Rock Speaker Connect; a Bluetooth landscape speaker that provides easy connectivity and setup scalability for long-lasting outdoor listening sessions of any size with an emphasis on audio quality.\nAdditional features include:\nFollowing CES, more detailed feature and specification information will be provided.

        "raw_content": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\nVictrola unveils a turntable with 'repeat function' plus a slew of hot decks\nVictrola Automatic boasts a first-of-its-kind 'repeat' feature\nRegular readers will need no further fanfare from us regarding Alannah Myles' Black Velvet eponym, Victrola, (the company's decks are arguably best-known for playing Jimmy Rodgers 'up high' in the middle of a Mississippi dry spell) but the iconic US turntable manufacturer is making the most of its moment under the CES 2024 spotlight with not one, not two, but six new products.\nSo let's get to it before the sun starts setting like molasses in the sky, shall we?\nFirst up is the Victrola Automatic, (pictured above), a fully automatic turntable that combines ease of use with that sleek, modern design aesthetic. What makes it special? Why, the first-of-its-kind 'Repeat' feature to continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record, thus eliminating unwanted pauses and tonearm resets during listening sessions, that's what! This comes alongside more standard play and tonearm lowering/raising functions as well as more modern features, including Bluetooth connectivity. All of this for just MSRP $199 (around \u00a3155 or AU$295)? I'm certainly interested.\nThe sapphire stone sits highest on the throne\nNext up, the Victrola Stream Sapphire wireless turntable (pictured above). Hot on the heels of the company's popular Stream wireless vinyl turntable lineup (including the Sonos-friendly Stream Carbon I love and Stream Onyx, as well as the firm's two-strong Hi-Res Carbon and Hi-Res Onyx turntable series), this best-in-class flagship wireless turntable now works with multiple streaming ecosystems. Essentially, Victrola Stream Sapphire builds on the DNA of Victrola\u2019s inaugural October 2022 Stream deck \u2013\u00a0which you can bone up on in our dedicated Victrola Stream Carbon review \u2013 by expanding on its connectivity solutions, with the ability to stream vinyl in \"stunning clarity\" to UPnP and Roon integrated systems as well as Sonos, plus support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nIts price? $1,499 (which is around \u00a31,180 or AU$2,225), so almost double the price of the $799 / \u00a3899 / AU$1,199 MSRP of the Stream Carbon and a definite move into premium territory. Will the gamble pay off for Victrola? Time will tell.\nLet's rock!\nNow, an interesting new direction for Victrola: stone-shaped wireless outdoor speakers. Although the company's ME1 speaker quickly became my retro style pick when it arrived in early 2022, I couldn't have predicted the Victrola Rock Speaker Connect, billed as an \"all-new premium Bluetooth landscape speaker that offers simple connectivity and vast scalability for long-lasting outdoor listening sessions of any size\".\nFeaturing up to 22 hours of battery from the built-in solar panel or USB-C charging, plus Bluetooth 5.3 with broadcast (which allows users to pair up to 20 speakers for full backyard audio immersion). Again, I'm interested for this money \u2013 which is $99 (or around \u00a378, AU$147) per rock...er, speaker. Does Victrola's offering remind me of the much more expensive Focal Littora, which look like the rock trolls from Frozen?

        "raw_content": "Victrola unveils a Roon Ready turntable and one you can play on repeat\nVictrola, the legacy audio brand that has been making record players for more than a century, announced today two new turntables at CES 2024: the Victrola Stream Sapphire, that brings new connection options to its wireless Works With Sonos line, and the Victrola Automatic, a new entry-level fully automatic Bluetooth turntable with a cool new repeat feature.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nAnnounced today, the Victrola Stream Sapphire adds a fourth Works with Sonos turntable to its lineup that includes the flagship Stream Carbon, the Stream Onyx, and the Stream Pearl, but building on the wireless turntable lineup with a range of new connectivity options and components.\nThe Stream Sapphire adds to the line\u2019s seamless ability to stream your vinyl over Sonos network players by adding new connectivity options, including Roon systems that allow users to stream vinyl through Roon Ready, AirPlay, and Chromecast protocols, and UPnP, which opens the door connecting to AV receivers, smart TVs, and UPnP-enabled speakers.\nDigital to analog conversion quality in the Sapphire has gotten a boost, too, now capable of 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio, which builds on the already stellar stream quality of its forbearers. But, if you still want to connect the Sapphire to your traditional analog system or powered speakers through RCA inputs, you can still do that too, and the Sapphire now includes an excellent cartridge upgrade to Ortofon\u2019s 2M Blue for better frequency response and dynamics.\nAdditional features are par for the course in the line and include a solid MDF plinth, belt drive, aluminum platter, carbon-fiber tonearm, and a slick walnut veneer.\n\u201cTheVictrola Stream turntable line was created out of a need to provide a seamless, integrated wireless solution to enjoy vinyl no matter where the listener is in their home, said Scott Hagen, CEO of Victrola. \u201cAfter hearing from both consumers and the integrator community, we recognized an opportunity to build on that promise by opening our ecosystem to include other popular streaming options while also elevating the turntable itself to a level we\u2019ve never introduced in the market before. Victrola Stream Sapphire is a perfectly crafted audiophile-level wireless vinyl solution that meets vinyl purists\u2019 standards while giving integrators the most versatile turntable for any project.\u201d\nThe Victrola Stream Sapphire will be available in Spring 2024 at Victrola.com, specialty audio retailers, and custom installation dealers for $1,500.\nVictrola Automatic\nOn the more entry-level end of the scale, Victrola has brought forth the Victrola Automatic, a Bluetooth- and analog-capable turntable that can be used whether you have a wired receiver-based system, powered speakers, or Bluetooth speakers or headphones you want to connect it to.\nDesigned with ease of use in mind, the Victrola Automatic works like a standard turntable with manual lift-and-lower tonearm functions, but it also features an up/down button on the surface that will do it for you, as well as what Victrola calls a \u201cfirst-of-its-kind \u2018Repeat\u201d feature to continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record.\u201d This can come in handy for those who like to putter around the house while listening to records, so the auto-repeat function will just keep the music playing for you instead of your needle rolling around the end of the record until you turn it off.\nOn the hardware side, the belt-driven turntable features a fixed headshell and counterweight for easy setup, a built-in switchable preamp, and an Audio-Technica AT-3600L cartridge.\n\u201cOur team has been working on a fully automatic turntable design for over three years,\u201d Haagen said. \u201cBut we weren\u2019t going to release it to the market until we had something that looks better, performs better, and is easier to use than any other turntable on the market in its class. Three years later, I\u2019m more than confident to say Victrola has delivered.\u201d\nThe Victrola Automatic will also be available in the spring and will retail for $200.\nNow is the perfect time to snag some great TV deals with the Super Bowl meaning retailers are keen to offer some awesome TVs at great prices. OLED technology is particularly great with its self-lit pixels meaning you get deep blacks on the screen at the same time as truly vibrant colors. Perfect for the Super Bowl and beyond. We\u2019ve picked out some of the very best Super Bowl OLED TV deals going on right now encompassing many different price ranges so there\u2019s something for everyone here. One such highlight is being able to buy a Samsung 77-inch S89C OLED TV for $1,600 but that\u2019s just one of the OLED TV deals going on. Here\u2019s what to consider buying.\nOur favorite Super Bowl OLED TV deal\nSamsung 77-inch S89C OLED TV -- $2,000, was $3,600\nSamsung is one of the best TV brands you can buy from thanks to its heavyweight reputation for making great QLED and OLED TVs. With the Samsung 77-inch S89C OLED TV, you\u2019re getting fantastic quality. It utilizes Quantum HDR OLED so that each scene is analyzed to guarantee accurate colors. It\u2019s also Pantone validated to further add to the fantastic detail level while the Neural Quantum processor offers exceptional levels of 4K upscaling for anything that isn\u2019t in 4K. For gamers, there\u2019s Game Motion Plus and Motion Xcelerator Turbo Pro which both enhance the refresh rate ensuring motion blur is a thing of the past. Even sound is superior thanks to Dolby Atmos and Object Tracking Sound Lite ensuring that audio feels immersive at all times. Anti glare properties and fantastic viewing angles ensure that this is one of the best TVs wherever you place it.\nQLED TVs are some of the best modern sets when it comes to overall picture quality and performance. Combining full-array backlighting, mini-LEDs, quantum dots, and some of the best image upscaling out there, brands like Samsung, Sony, TCL, and Hisense are just a handful of the brands behind this impressive tech. And if we learned anything at CES 2024, it\u2019s that the world of QLEDs will continue to evolve.\nWith brightness capabilities that excel in well-lit lit rooms when compared to OLED TVs, the vibrant and colorful picture of a QLED TV might be the better choice for you. But where does one begin? Available in an array of sizes, model types, and prices, choosing a new QLED TV can be quite a challenge, but we've got years of experience testing and reviewing them, and are here to help with our list of the best QLED TVs for 2024.\nIf you\u2019ve been thinking about purchasing a new TV, and your top priorities are rich colors, unbeatable contrast, and next-level image upscaling, you should definitely consider an OLED set.\nThe OLED acronym stands for \u201cOrganic Light Emitting Diode,\u201d which is how these TVs produce a picture. Instead of relying on LED backlighting, OLEDs are equipped with self-emissive pixels (they produce their own light) that are individually controllable. This also means that, when needed, these pixels can be completely turned off, resulting in beautifully dark, inky black levels.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

She previously wrote about everything from web development to AI at Inside.\nShare this story\nOver the past few years, Victrola\u2019s come back on the scene with slick turntables capable of streaming to Sonos\u2019 wireless speakers. Now, the company is taking things a step further with the Victrola Stream Sapphire, a turntable that\u2019s capable of streaming records to just about anything.\nAnnounced during CES 2024, Victrola\u2019s highest-end Works with Sonos turntable costs a whopping $1,499 and will be available in the US in the spring. That\u2019s nearly double the price of the $800 Stream Carbon and almost a grand more than the $599 Stream Onyx, a stripped-down version of the Carbon Victrola announced at last year\u2019s CES.\nRelated\nFor the added price, you get something both the Stream Onyx and Stream Carbon lack: Roon and UPnP integration. As a result, you can stream records to thousands of compatible gadgets, ranging from non-Sonos Bluetooth speakers and soundbars to iOS, Android, and Windows devices like smartphones and laptops.\nVictrola also amps the game up when it comes to the Stream Sapphire\u2019s sound and build. With support for 24-bit / 48kHz lossless FLAC audio, the turntable should deliver higher-quality audio than its predecessors. It\u2019s also built with higher-quality materials, with a wooden plinth, upgraded brushless motor, and a pricey Ortofon Blue 2M cartridge.\nThe Stream Sapphire wasn\u2019t the only audio device Victrola announced at CES this year. The company also introduced the Victrola Automatic, a lower-priced turntable that\u2019ll be available for $199 this spring. It\u2019s not a Works with Sonos turntable, but it does support Bluetooth and comes with a unique \u201cRepeat\u201d feature that lets you continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record.\nVictrola also introduced the Victrola Rock Speaker Connect, its first Bluetooth landscape speaker geared for outdoor use that resembles a rock. It\u2019s capable of pairing with up to 20 speakers, can charge via a built-in solar panel and USB-C, and is supposed to last up to 22 hours. The water-resistant speaker will be available in three colors \u2014 sand, stone, and granite \u2014 sometime this winter for $99.\nNetflix is turning into cable TV\nNetflix is going to take away its cheapest ad-free plan\nNintendo goes after the Palworld Pok\u00e9mon modder\nThe Verge\u2019s favorite mobile phone gadgets\nTesla\u2019s new compact crossover is reportedly coming in 2025, but will it cost $25,000?\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nAqara\u2019s new hub is a multi-protocol Matter powerhouse\nEcovacs\u2019 new cleaning station pairs its flagship robovac with a handheld vacuum\nThis smart lock can recognize your face\nThis Philips door lock turns your palm into a key\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.
