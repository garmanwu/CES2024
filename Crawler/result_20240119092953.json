The program was ALL ON for CES 2024, receiving more than 3000 submissions, a record high and a 40% increase over CES 2023.\nEach year, an independent panel of industry expert judges, including members of the media, designers and engineers, reviews and rates submissions based on innovation, functionality, aesthetic, and design. Those rated the highest across all categories receive the Best of Innovation designation.\nFor the CES 2024 program, the top two categories by number of submissions were \u2018digital health\u2019 and \u2018sustainability, eco-design & smart energy.\u2019 This trend underscores the rapid pace of innovation in sectors that promise to solve big global challenges and improve human lives \u2013 a major theme at the show as CTA partners with the UN Trust Fund for Human Security and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS) to advance human security. For the first time, the Best of Innovation list for CES 2024 includes a product from the \u2018Human Security\u2019 category, introduced at CES 2023.\nThe CES 2024 Innovation Awards also features a new category \u2013 artificial intelligence (AI). The AI category received 7% of all applications, underscoring that innovators are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of AI in shaping the future of technology. AI will also be pervasive throughout the CES 2024 show floor and conference programming.\nThe full Best of Innovation list and all 522 Innovation Award honorees will be announced during CES 2024, where many of the products will appear in the Innovation Awards Showcase at CES, located in the Venetian Expo.\nThe Best of Innovation honorees for 2024 include:\nAirFarm\nCompany: Midbar Co., Ltd.\nProduct Category: Human Security for All\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nAirJet\u00aeMini \u2013 Solid-State Active Cooling Chip for Electronic Devices\nCompany: Frore Systems\nProduct Category: Embedded Technologies\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nAVEIR\u2122 Dual chamber (DR) Leadless Pacemaker System\nCompany: Abbott\nProduct Category: Digital Health\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones\nCompany: Bose\nProduct Category: Headphones & Personal Audio\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nFINTIN V1 : The Most Accessible Qwerty-Communicator\nCompany: ONECOM.CO.,LTD.\nProduct Category: Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nGun Detection System\nCompany: Bosch\nProduct Category: Artificial Intelligence\nHestia\nCompany: VAONIS\nProduct Category: Digital Imaging/Photography\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nHonda Motocompacto\nCompany: Honda\nProduct Category: Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nHP Spectre Fold\nCompany: HP Inc.\nProduct Category: Computer Hardware & Components\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nIINK - 4D Food Printing System for Future Food\nCompany: Top Table Inc.\nProduct Category: Food & AgTech\nInteractive Transparent Window\nCompany: AUO Corporation\nProduct Category: In-Vehicle Entertainment\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nITX181225\nCompany: I-TEN SA\nProduct Category: Sustainability, Eco-Design & Smart Energy\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nJBL Authentics 500\nCompany: Harman International Corp\nProduct Category: Headphones & Personal Audio\u00e2\u20ac\u00af\nMand.ro Mark 7D\nCompany: Mand.ro Co.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: The 23 top gadgets\nThese are the best products and innovations at a CES dominated by AI\nWe all knew going into CES 2024 that AI was going to be a huge theme, but artificial intelligence was so prevalent at this year\u2019s show it became dizzying. It seemed that every single product had AI inside, from AI bird feeders and snore tracking pillows to TVs and even NPCs within games.\nSo which gadgets actually lived up to the hype? Tom\u2019s Guide\u2019s editors met with dozens of companies and went hands on with lots of new products to bring you our Best of CES 2024 list. LG\u2019s transparent OLED was all the buzz for its stunning design, and our editors loved the new Weber Summit Smart Grill. But smaller companies impressed, too, such as Rabbit R1 AI handheld that can automate all sorts of tasks.\nHere are the best gadgets we saw at CES 2024.\nBest in Show: Rabbit R1\nI mean, this was kind of inevitable right? In a sea of companies stuffing LLMs into any and all products without rhyme or reason, the Rabbit R1 is a revolution in actionable AI \u2014 packed into a neat design from the geniuses at Teenage Engineering.\nAvailable for just $199, this charming little piece of hardware is not supposed to replace your phone. Instead, it\u2019s set to do certain tasks a whole lot smarter and actually be a useful assistant, and it all comes down to the Large Action Model. This patented tech learns how to interact with websites and apps to fulfill various tasks, and it pairs with the built-in LLM to not only give you advice, but do what you want, too. Put simply, this is a breakthrough. \u2013 Jason England\nBest Design: LG Signature OLED T\nThere are OLED TVs, and then there are OLED TVs you can stick your hand behind and see through. The LG Signature OLED T is nothing short of a design feat, so it\u2019s no wonder the set and its split contrast screen stole headlines at CES 2024. As a prototype-turned-real-product (remember, we first saw a transparent OLED concept last show), the LG Signature OLED T demonstration LG brought to this year felt near ready for living rooms.\nIn fact, the Signature OLED T feels like the culmination of a lot of things LG has been working on in recent years. It even has the Zero Connect Box like on the wireless M-series OLED. It\u2019s important to have a super clean-looking setup if you\u2019re getting a TV like this, as you wouldn't want anything to compromise the effect. LG even thought to build a cabinet that houses the system like home decor. That attention to detail is precisely what we look for in our Best Design category. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest VR/AR: Xreal 2 Ultra\nAfter making a splash in the AR glasses market with the Xreal Air 2 and providing us with a glimpse of what spatial computing could be like on a pair of specs, the company has fully committed to taking on the likes of Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3 with the Air 2 Ultra.\nThe line between AR specs and VR headsets has truly been blurred \u2014 thanks to those dual 3D cameras up front. These allow for mapping your surroundings and even hand tracking, and it\u2019s all possible in a rather luxurious-looking pair of sunglasses. Make no mistake about it, this is what real progress looks like in this field. Top it all off with a wider viewing angle through the 1080p OLED displays and you\u2019ve got something great for not just long-distance travel but using at home, too. \u2013 Jason England\nBest TV: Samsung S95D OLED TV\nWe saw dozens of TVs at CES, from modest updates to popular sets, to mind-bending concepts that\u2019ll never see the light of day. Our favorite overall TV of CES 2024, the Samsung S95D OLED TV lands somewhere in the middle, following up one of the best TVs we reviewed last year in a way that feels more innovative than iterative. That\u2019s thanks to what Samsung calls OLED Glare Free Technology.\nThe set has more of a matte finish that stands up to harsh ambient lighting conditions. We got to see it side by side with a so-called conventional OLED, and the anti-glare treatment made a clear difference. It seems like Samsung took it\u2019s learnings from the Frame (which has also been updated this year) and gambled on it for OLED, and for us, it paid off. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest TV Innovation: Hisense UX 110\nThe Hisense UX 110-inch Mini-LED TV is a true feat of engineering. Not only is the screen size significantly larger than anything we\u2019re used to seeing, but its reported specs are significantly higher than any other TV on the market right now. According to Hisense, the largest version of the UX can reach a peak brightness of 10,000 nits and uses 40,000 local dimming zones. It can cover 100% of the DCI-P3 color spectrum and comes with a built-in 4.2.2-channel Dolby Atmos sound system.\nTo hit these numbers, Hisense had to overcome two relatively huge challenges. The first issue is that UX needed a method of controlling all those local dimming zones, and the second is that UX needed a way to deal with all the heat that\u2019s put out by the Mini-LED panel. The first problem Hisense solved by using its Hi-View Engine X that implements a 16-bit AI neural chipset to enable object-based upscaling. To overcome the heating problem, it installed a ventilation system in the back of the screen and a massive heat sink to keep things nice and cool. In a show that\u2019s all about going above and beyond what\u2019s already possible, the Hisense UX is truly a next-generation Mini-LED TV. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest TV Value: TCL QM7 Mini-LED TV\nIn a perfect world, we\u2019d all be able to buy a cutting-edge TV for pennies on the dollar. Unfortunately, the more advanced the TV, the higher the price tag is. Thankfully, TCL\u2019s new QM7 model really bucks that trend by implementing a Mini-LED lighting system that can reach upwards of 2,000 nits and offers up to 1,300 zones on its largest model (a massive 98-inch TV). Mind you, in the past, the Q7 series has sold for just a few hundred dollars \u2014 and it\u2019s very likely that the QM7 will follow suit.\nAt a show all about the latest and greatest technology, we love seeing some good value TVs pop up, so for us to see this level of performance in a TV that could cost less than a PS5 is truly wow-worthy. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Laptop: HP Omen Transcend 14\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 is a gaming laptop that doesn\u2019t look the part. Though it sports RGB lighting on its keyboard, you could easily mistake the Transcend 14 for an ultraportable. In fact, HP is marketing it as \u201cthe world\u2019s lightest 14-inch gaming laptop.\u201d It\u2019s a fetching machine that won\u2019t look out of place at the office.\nOther than its design, the HP Omen Transcend 14 separates itself from the best gaming laptops by packing a Meteor Lake chip. This processor\u2019s NPU can handle the processing necessary to run a streaming application like OBS while the laptop\u2019s CPU and GPU can focus solely on whatever game you\u2019re playing. This could be a selling point for those who stream to platforms like Twitch.\nThe HP Omen Transcend 14 makes a strong case for AI laptops. But even outside of that, it\u2019s a sleek and elegant device that\u2019s ideal for anyone looking for a solid Windows 11 laptop. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nThe Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is a 2-in-1 laptop in the most literal sense \u2014 and one of the 9 best laptops of CES 2024. Its display is a fully functional Android tablet while its keyboard base (hybrid station) is a Windows 11 laptop featuring an Intel Meteor Lake CPU. Most 2-in-1 laptops basically give you a Windows 11 machine in two form factors. Because the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid is an Android and Windows in one, it\u2019s one of the most unique devices of CES 2024.\nYou can snap off the display to use it as an Android tablet while the hybrid station is connected to an external monitor. You can also switch between Android and Windows modes with the press of a button. That means you can use the keyboard and touchpad to play the best Android games or use any Android application. Though somewhat pricey at $1,999, the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 seems like a great value for what it offers. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Fitness Wearable: Amazfit Helio Ring\nThe Oura Ring has proved very popular among those who want to gain better insights into their health and sleep, but Amazfit\u2019s new Helio Ring is taking that idea one step further. When you wear the Helio in conjunction with one of Amazfit\u2019s fitness trackers, it can better analyze your daily activity to provide smarter insights on how much you should rest, and the right kind of recovery, before you pick up those weights or go for a run again.\nTo help you get a better night\u2019s sleep, Amazfit is also using an AI that will play ambient sounds through your smartphone, and then adjust the audio based on the data it collects from the Helio Ring as you doze. Given that we expect other heavyweights like Samsung to also jump into the smart ring market, it\u2019s pretty smart for Amazfit to show up first with a potentially less expensive option. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Health Tech: Withings Beamo\nWe\u2019re still a long way from carrying a Star Trek-style tricorder with us, but the Withings Beamo might just be the first step. This small handheld device \u2014 about the size of a stubby highlighter \u2014 is capable of measuring your body temperature and blood oxygen saturation, provides medical-grade ECG readings, and serves a digital stethoscope for monitoring heart and lung functions.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO can pick up signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib), blood oxygen desaturation, heart murmurs, asthma, COPD and more, and then share those results with a healthcare professional via your smartphone. Users can even stream their stethoscope audio directly to a doctor during telehealth appointments. While Withings is still waiting for FDA approval, it hopes to ship the device by the summer. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Robot: Samsung Ballie\nYes, Samsung has shown off a previous Ballie robot before, but the new Ballie at CES 2024 is different. Now it has built-in AI that helps it greet you at the door and control various smart home devices. But the coolest addition is a built-in projector that can beam content on the floor, walls and even your ceiling.\nThis includes welcome messages, workout videos (complete with your heart rate from your Samsung watch) and video calls. Hopefully Ballie is more than just a concept this time around, because it\u2019s a robot I\u2019d like to try out in my own home. \u2014 Mark Spoonauer\nBest Gaming Peripheral: Serafim S3 mobile game controller\nThe Backbone One has been one of the best mobile game controllers for years \u2014 thanks to its ideal combo of comfortable-to-use hardware and slick software experience. But it wasn\u2019t perfect, and that\u2019s where the Serafim S3 hits hard for critical damage by fixing the Backbone\u2019s key problems.\nNamely, these come down to three things. First, the hand grips can be customized with various sizes to accommodate bigger hands. Second, joystick drift has been eliminated as hall effect sensors are in use here. And finally, you get virtually the same full software suite of in-game capture and a slick UI without needing to pay a subscription fee. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14\nThis year\u2019s Zephyrus G14 is all about refinements to the formula that put this 14-inch beast atop our best gaming laptops list. Instead of the Anime Matrix display looking kinda cringe, a single slash of lighting brings a premium look and feel to the far more refined aluminum shell. And while this model is upgradeable to an RTX 4070 rather than last year\u2019s 4090, it more than makes up for it with a stunning OLED display and solid improvements to the keyboard and touchpad experience.\nIn fact, with these small tweaks, I would argue that the ROG Zephyrus G14 has bigger competition in mind than simply gaming laptops. With a vibrant new screen and prosumer-esque looks, the 14-inch MacBook Pro should be getting nervous right now. \u2014 Jason England\nBest Appliance: LG Smart WashCombo\nLG has come out with a dual washer and dryer that might actually do the trick \u2014 and save you money in the process. The LG Smart WashCombo promises to do a full load of laundry in less than two hours, thanks to LG\u2019s Inverter HeatPump technology as well as built-in intelligence that can analyze not just what kinds of clothes you put in the washer, but how dirty they are.\nEven better: The SmartWash Combo is a ventless dryer, and it runs on 120V, so you can plug it in anywhere and don\u2019t have to worry about running a duct outside. And did we mention it uses 60% less energy than its vented counterparts? \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Grill: Weber Summit Smart Grill\nIf any one product will make you ready for barbecue season, it's Weber's new flagship gas grill. While we saw tons of smart grills and smokers at CES 2024, the Weber Summit smart gas grill has enough cool features and cooking functions to turn you into the ultimate backyard host, if you weren't one already. There are two elements that elevate the latest Weber Summit unit from your stereotypical grill. First, it offers a top-down infrared broiler unlike anything you'll find in the current grill market; and second, it's powered by a digital control system that makes grilling more modern.\nOnce the grill is ignited, all the settings can be managed on the Weber Connect smartphone app. That way, you can track the cook temperatures from the built-in probes without standing over the grill. For us, that means we can enjoy more quality time with our guests while still grilling up a great meal. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Smart Home Device: Abode Edge Outdoor security camera\nUntil now, most of the best home security cameras have had a major limitation: They couldn\u2019t be used beyond the range of your Wi-Fi router, so you\u2019d be lucky if you could place one 400 feet away. But what if you could use a camera up to 1.5 miles away, without needing to pay for cellular service? That\u2019s the bold claim made by the Abode Edge Outdoor Security Cam, the first to use what\u2019s known as WiFi HaLow, a flavor of Wi-Fi that has less throughput, but much greater range and much less power consumption.\nEven if you don\u2019t have a property as big as Versailles, the Abode Edge Camera could also be useful in areas of your house or property where your Wi-Fi signal is weak. Of course, you\u2019ll need Abode\u2019s home security system to use this $199 camera, which could give the DIY home security company a competitive advantage over its rivals. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest Audio/Headphones: JBL Live TWS 3\nWhat good is a pair of fancy new true wireless earbuds if they don\u2019t have a great case to go with them? The JBL Live TWS 3 takes the 1.45-inch LED touchscreen charging case from the JBL Tour Pro 2 and matches it up with the new Live TWS 3 earbuds. With the touchscreen, there\u2019s no need to take out your phone when listening to music \u2014 you can control the music or access the settings straight from the charging case.\nEven better, the Live 3 will have access to Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and supports multipoint connections. JBL\u2019s also improved the battery life compared to its older models, and the Live TWS 3 are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nSo they\u2019re going to be pretty expensive, right? Not really. JBL plans to release the Live TWS 3 in mid-June of this year for $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199. \u2014\u00a0Nick Pino\nBest Phone Accessory: Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the best mobile accessory we found at CES 2024. Essentially, it's a battery-powered iPhone mount that unlocks a lesser-known iOS 17 feature, and it's super convenient for recording content. There are iPhone stands before with face-tracking, but they all have the same issue: they need to be paired to the product's companion app in order to actually capture any content.\nThe Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro eliminates this friction by letting you use it while you record in the iPhone's native camera app. That\u2019s because it leverages the DockKit developer SDK that launched in iOS 17. The device can also run on battery power for up to five hours, so it can be brought on the go for content capture, too. \u2014\u00a0Kate Kozuch\nBest Monitor: Alienware 32 4K OLED monitor\nThe Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED is one of the best monitors of CES 2024 \u2026 if not the best. Billed as the world\u2019s fastest 4K OLED monitor, the Alienware 32 makes any game you\u2019re playing \u2014 from the best PC games, best PS5 games and best Xbox Series X games look and run at their best.\nMinute details come through in crystal clarity thanks to the panel\u2019s 140 PPI (pixels per inch), which is the highest of any existing OLED gaming monitor (most max out at 100 PPI). Alienware claims the display can achieve 99% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, which accounts for the lush colors. On top of that, the 240Hz refresh rate and 0.03ms response time ensure games run buttery smooth. If you\u2019re like me and loved 2022\u2019s Alienware 34 QD-OLED, you\u2019re going to adore the new Alienware 32. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Router: TP-Link Archer GE800\nAfter unveiling its first Wi-Fi 7 routers at CES last year, this year TP-Link has launched its first gaming router with support for the latest wireless standard. The TP-Link Archer GE800 is a tri-band Wi-Fi 7 gaming router that looks the part with immersive RGB lighting on its sides but it also packs in plenty of networking power for even the most serious gamers and can reach download speeds of up to 19 Gbps.\nAt the back, you\u2019ll find two 10 gigabit ports along with four 2.5 gigabit ports and a USB 3.0 port for moving data from a flash or hard drive across your network. However, one of these 2.5 gigabit ports is actually dedicated to gaming. When you connect a gaming PC, laptop or console to this port, their traffic will be automatically prioritized so you can focus on your favorite game instead of fighting with other devices on your home network for bandwidth. \u2014 Anthony Spadafora\nBest Rideable: Segway GoKart Pro 2\nSegway\u2019s GoKarts are hella fun \u2014 they can hit speeds of up to 22 miles per hour, and even have a handbrake so you can do spinouts and drift through corners. But they\u2019ve had one big limitation: You can\u2019t drive them around when the weather\u2019s bad. The Segway GoKart Pro 2 solves that \u2014 in a way. On rainy days, or times when it\u2019s just too cold to take a drive, you can pair the GoKart with a gaming console, and use its steering wheel and pedals as a controller for driving games. Even better: haptics have been built into the GoKart, so when your video game car hits a rough patch, you\u2019ll feel it in the seat of your pants.\nWhen you\u2019re out on the track IRL, you can cruise at 26.7 miles per hour, faster than previous models, and paddle shifters on the steering wheel give you even more control over the GoKart\u2019s performance. For even more realism, a detachable Bluetooth speaker can play the sounds of a single-cylinder, dual-cylinder, V8 or V12 engine to get you revving as fast as the GoKart. This was one gadget at CES that we didn\u2019t want to stop testing. \u2014 Mike Prospero\nBest AI: Nvidia AI NPC\nHave you ever gotten tired of hearing NPCs in video games spout the same repeated lines of dialogue? What if they actually responded like actual people and could hold a conversation? That\u2019s something gamers have long asked for and are about to receive thanks to Nvidia ACE.\nNvidia demoed its AI platform Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) at CES 2024 and I got to try it myself. In a cyberpunk bar setting, I asked the NPC Nova what components I should buy in a PC, and she (not surprisingly) suggested an Nvidia RTX 40-series GPU. When I asked her what was in her rig, she said an RTX 4080 with 32GB of RAM. She got cheeky with me when I asked why she didn\u2019t have 64GB \u2014 saying that much RAM was overkill.\nNvidia said it\u2019s creating digital avatars that use ACE technologies in collaboration with top game developers including Charisma.AI and NetEase Games. AI NPCs might not become ubiquitous for years, but it\u2019s cool to get a glimpse of the future with this demo. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nBest Accessibility tech: Wheely-X home cardio trainer\nWheelchair users like me can often find it difficult to exercise since most gym equipment is designed for able-bodied people. Wheelchair treadmills (or similar devices) exist but I\u2019ve never seen one I\u2019d like to use. Thankfully, a chance encounter with Kangsters at CES 2024 showed me a device I\u2019d love to own \u2014 the Wheely-X.\nThe main body consists of two thin ramps and rollers that keep your wheels in place as you roll. What makes the Wheely-X unique is that you can play exercise video games when it\u2019s connected to a computer and monitor. I played a wheelchair racing game where I competed against NPCs on a race track (I won, if you must know). Another demo had me wheeling an avatar over ice \u2026 which was a bit trickier.\nThe Wheely-X is available now for $2,595. That\u2019s not cheap, but if it can help wheelchair users stay in shape (and do so by playing some games), I think the price is more than reasonable. \u2014 Tony Polanco\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nTom's Guide upgrades your life by helping you decide what products to buy, finding the best deals and showing you how to get the most out of them and solving problems as they arise.

Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nCES 2024 is in full swing, and more innovative product reveals were made on day 2 of the biggest tech show of the year. And since it's the biggest show, we know not everyone is going to catch the hundreds of announcements across the more than 4,000 exhibitors.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nZDNET has cut through all the noise to bring you the most important and biggest announcements and products of day 2 that you may have missed. We were even able to go hands-on with some of these products below.\nStay tuned for even more product and big tech announcements tomorrow for CES day 3.\n1. New features coming to Android devices\nAndroid users will appreciate the several exciting announcements that Google made at CES Day 2. The most important feature coming to Android devices next month is a cross-Android solution called Quick Share. Quick Share will offer peer-to-peer content sharing across all types of Android-based devices, such as phones and even Chromebooks.\nAlso: CES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nOther new features and updates include Fast Pair support expansion, more casting capabilities to more apps and devices (including TikTok), and Android Auto integration into more vehicles like the new \u00a0Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning.\n2. Nanoleaf's impressive smart lighting\nSmart lighting company, Nanoleaf, announced some exciting additions to its smart lighting lineup, including a new Orchestrator software for music integrations. The software connects directly to a computer's sound source and isolates the response to the device, resulting in the lights reacting to an audio track's precise different layers.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight was also revealed, which the company says is a set of square light panels that are meant to be installed on the ceiling and capable of emitting 1400 lumens per square. Other product announcements included multicolor outdoor string lights with Matter support.\n3. EcoFlow's whole-house portable power station\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra generator has been recognized as a 2024 CES Innovation Awards Honoree thanks to its impressive specs. These include a power capacity of 6kWh (an entire home), and capable of 7200W output and 5.6kW of solar input. The system is also compatible with expansion packs, increasing the power capacity to a whopping 90kWh which can run power to your home's essential appliances for up to an entire month.\nAlso: The best CES 2024 gadgets you can buy right now\nZDNET writer Maria Diaz got to try this powerful generator at her own home and called it the \"Swiss Army Knife of home backup systems,\" adding that it's also \"a whisper-quiet solution, one that you can't even hear when under 2000W.\"\n4. Android's answer to Apple Watch's double-tap feature\nThe Wow Mouse app was built for Android smartwatches to act as an extension to the smartwatch, letting you control tech around you via Bluetooth with just a gesture of your hands. It's kind of similar to Apple's Double-Tap feature on the Apple Watch, but instead of controlling things on the watch itself, Wow Mouse takes it up a notch and allows users to turn their smart lights on or off or lower the volume of a speaker.\n5. A battery that charges your phone in mere seconds\nCES is all about using tech to provide solutions, and this external smartphone battery from Swappery solves the problem of a dead battery in just seven seconds. Here's how it works: When your phone runs out of juice, place it in the Swapery station, wait seven seconds, then remove it to get a new battery attachment that will last you approximately 8-10 hours, the company says.\nAlso: The best mobile accessories at CES 2024: Qi2 chargers, face-tracking phone stands, and more\nThough it isn't your most conventional charger, it could give you a fully charged battery without needing any other cables, adapters, or plug-ins.\n6. Lenovo's hybrid laptop\nLenovo announced the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid at CES day 2, and it's impressive for two reasons. First, it's a 2-in-1 device that can be a laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, or a touchscreen tablet with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ processor. Second, it switches between Windows and Android seamlessly, depending on what \"mode\" (tablet or laptop) you choose.\nAlso: Lenovo made a Mac Studio for Windows users, and it might even be better\nEach component of this hybrid device even has its own battery. It'll cost you $1,999, but you really get a seperate tablet and a laptop all in one for the price.\n7. An AI gadget that interacts with apps so you don't have to\nRabbit is going back to the basics at CES 2024 with its Rabbit R1 device that wants to essentially replace the need for your smartphone when it comes to using apps. The little gadget fits into your palm and uses AI to see and learn how a user interacts with their typical smartphone apps and web experiences and then reproduce it (when verbally asked) on a customized cloud platform.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nThe basis is really for those who may want to solve their smartphone addiction since it scrolls your apps for you. Rabbit says some of the popular apps you can task R1 with include Spotify, Apple Music, DoorDash, Uber, Amazon, and more.\n8. Amazon introduces Matter Casting\nAmazon is taking a page out of Apple and Google's casting playbook and introduced a new way to cast videos from your phones and tablets directly on supported Amazon devices. Called Matter Casting, you can now cast Prime Video content to the Echo Show 15. Support for Fire TV devices, including TVs with Fire TV built in, will roll out in the next few months, and Amazon added that it hopes to add Matter Casting capabilities to services like Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, STARZ, and more within the year.\nUnlike Apple AirPlay and Google Chromecast, Amazon's Matter Casting uses the Matter Protocol of the open technology standard so that smart home tech from different brands can all work together more seamlessly.\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 3: The 6 announcements you may have missed\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES Day 4: ZDNET's top 10 CES stories you don't want to miss"

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

(AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nLAS VEGAS (AP) \u2014 From electric cars to transparent TVs to the latest accessibility tech and virtual assistants backed by artificial intelligence, there was a wide range of innovations on display at the CES tech show in Las Vegas this week. The best of it aimed to solve big real-world problems. Some of it aimed to make your life more fun. And some of it was just a little out there.\nAssociated Press journalists spent last week combing cavernous exhibit halls for the most exciting, interesting and unusual tech innovations.\nHere\u2019s what caught our eye at CES 2024.\nACCESSIBILITY PRODUCTS WERE BIG ON HOPE\nAt a conference where excess and opulence manifested itself in nearly everything, it was encouraging to see how much progress has been made toward developing assistive technologies for the disabled.\nBoston-based GyroGear, a medical tech startup, debuted a hand-stabilizing glove at CES 2024 that it hopes will help Parkinson\u2019s patients and those with hand tremors regain control of their lives. Dutch startup Whispp is using audio-to-audio-based AI to give people with vocal impairments a chance to have real-time conversations in their own natural voices. OrCam introduced a host of devices designed to help those with hearing loss deal with auditory overload. And Sony reserved some prime space in its booth to showcase its Access controller for PlayStation.\nMAKING CONNECTIONS BETWEEN NEARLY EVERYTHING\nUsing software and AI to achieve inter-device connections between smart devices, your home and even your car was central to many of the biggest tech companies at CES 2024.\nSamsung\u2019s new \u201cAI for all\u201d mantra meant integrating its smart home devices and appliances to perform tasks in unison \u2014 like the act of recipe selection automatically pre-heating your oven. The South Korean tech giant also announced a collaboration with Hyundai to develop \u201chome-to-car\u201d and \u201ccar-to-home\u201d services for all Kia and Hyundai vehicles. Google is expanding Chromecast to more apps and devices. And Amazon endorsed the Matter casting standard to create more inter-operability between smart devices.\nMeanwhile, Mercedes-Benz unveiled a new AI-powered virtual assistant to personalize interactions between drivers and their cars.\nVEHICLES ADVANCES WERE ON FULL DISPLAY\nCES 2024 was brimming with new electric vehicles, remote construction vehicles, hydrogen engines and other mobility advances.\nHonda premiered two concept cars, dubbed the \u201cSaloon\u201d and \u201cSpace-Hub,\u201d for a new global EV series. Kia decided to go modular with a trio of electric vans that can quickly swap body modules to change their functionality. And Vietnam-based electric upstart VinFast unveiled an electric truck concept.\nBosch Mobility and Hyundai both doubled down on hydrogen as an energy solution. And Hyundai showcased its AI-based autonomous construction excavator.\nHOPE YOU\u2019RE HUNGRY\nChef-like robots, AI-powered appliances and other high-tech kitchen gadgets are holding out the promise that humans don\u2019t need to cook \u2014 or mix drinks \u2014 for themselves anymore.\nGE wants you to start smoke food indoors, while generative AI is powering a Brisk smart grill that aims to make the art of barbecuing foolproof.\nFreezing your own ice cream at home takes hours, but ColdSnap\u2019s new ice cream machine prepares your frozen treat in two minutes. And Bartesian\u2019s cocktail-mixing appliance can make as many as 60 different kinds of drinks for you.\nMeanwhile, for much younger consumers (and their parents), Veba Baby\u2019s smart baby bottle monitor tracks the expiration of breast milk and formula. The product \u2014 which also serves as a bottle locator \u2014 monitors the temperature, when a baby feeds from the bottle, and more to detect freshness. And everything is logged onto an accompanying app.\nWHAT\u2019S NEW ON TV?\nOLED, Micro LED, 8k ... what does it all mean? It means you see an extremely sharp image, but the most interesting TVs on display this CES were barely visible at all.\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung unveiled transparent TVs at the show.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u2019s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode. Samsung\u2019s transparent MICRO LED-powered display worked in a very similar way, but was on display as a concept.\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, both can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\n___\nAssociated Press reporters Wyatte Grantham-Philips, Rio Yamat, McKinnon de Kuyper and Shawn Chen contributed to this report.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch to see what's next in tech\nAfter 2023 gave us the most innovative year in tech in over a decade, the two trends that powered much of that innovation -- AI and VR/AR -- are poised to lead the way at CES 2024. And following a fall product launch season that was as intense as any we've ever seen in the tech ecosystem, CES 2024 is set to explode with a ton of announcements about real products that are coming in the months ahead.\nIn other words, you can expect to see a lot fewer of the CES experiments and flights-of-fancy of the past dominating the headlines this year, because there are so many interesting and useful new things to crowd them out.\nSpecial Feature\nCES 2024\nEach year, CES reveals new product trends that transform the future of work and life. ZDNET will sort through the wave of news and announcements to find the innovations that will matter most to professionals.\nZDNET has already been pre-briefed on many of the best products that are coming, and we're looking forward to sharing our first impressions, original photos and videos, and buying advice. Our team will be on the ground at CES as well as covering it broadly from multiple time zones. We'll highlight the products we're most excited about, the trends that are taking shape from the show, and the latest innovations most likely to shape the future.\nTo put it all in context, here are the three themes that will make the biggest impact at this year's CES.\n1. AI clouds everything\nAny product that includes an algorithm, machine learning, or automation of any kind is going to be marketed as an AI-powered product at CES 2024. Make no mistake, there will be plenty of AI-washing, as companies vie with each other to ride the generative AI wave. ZDNET will help you cut through the AI marketing cacophony to learn the best AI innovations coming to products in 2024. Fortunately, there are a ton of potential benefits to look forward to -- from products and features that will automatically translate audio and text from different languages to TV hardware that will improve upscaling of low-res content for today's amazing 4K and 8K displays to truly time-saving automations in the products you use every day.\n2. VR, AR, and XR prep for a big year\nThe metaverse may have been dud, but mixed reality (MR) and extended reality (XR) are surging on a new wave of interest -- thanks in large part to Apple's Vision Pro announcement, which has put the spotlight on the next generation of immersive digital experiences. You can get an excellent taste of these today in the Meta Quest 3, ZDNET's 2023 product of the year. And CES 2024 will feature new hardware and experiences that will push it to the next level. We're expecting announcements about headsets that will use Qualcomm's new XR2+ Gen2 VR chip, new sensors and software that will extend what today's headsets and experiences can do, and the latest updates on how all kinds of organizations -- from health care to astronauts to law enforcement to architects to product designers -- are now relying on VR and XR to do critical parts of their work every day. Of course, all of this is a prelude to the launch of the Apple Vision Pro, the arrival of the Samsung/Google XR headset, and a tidal wave of new experiences from developers who will take advantage of these immersive digital platforms.\n3. 100-inch TVs lead a wave of innovation\nTVs are back at the center of innovation at this year's show -- and leaps forward in display technology are making an even bigger and broader impact across the tech industry. From OLED to Mini-LED to Laser TV (projectors), there's a new explosion of innovation and competition that's making content more exciting than ever to consume. Nothing says CES like 100-inch TVs, and we're going to see a lot of them at CES 2024. A new generation of 100-inch TVs is coming to market that won't break the bank or your back. We can't wait to show you the latest TVs and home entertainment products that are coming and we'll offer analysis and buying advice on which ones could transform and level up\u00a0the way you experience content in 2024.\nStay tuned to ZDNET to cut through the fluff and find the stuff that's worth your attention at CES 2024.\nRelated\nThe 5 biggest headphones trends that you'll be hearing more about in 2024\n2024 in tech: The true winners next year will be the companies that do this\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis.
