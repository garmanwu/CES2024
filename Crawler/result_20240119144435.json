Since launching the first-ever smart cordless stick vacuum in 2019, an earlier model of the Pure One Station, Tineco continues its commitment to cleaning innovation. The brand's latest launch into home cleaning offers advanced engineering features such as iLoop Smart Sensor Technology, which detects messes and adjusts the unit's suction or water flow automatically, and Pouch Cell Technology that maintains exceptional power for an extended duration of time.\nThe prices and sales dates will be confirmed later in 2024.\nTineco Floor One Switch S7\nThis first-of-its-kind smart multi-function cleaner with a SwitchPro Motor can switch seamlessly between a floor washer or vacuum unit, providing an ultimate solution for whole-house cleaning. Its floor washer features include MHCBS technology, ensuring the unit is washing with the freshest of water, a self-cleaning system and much more. The vacuum is equipped with a specially designed ZeroTangle brush head and PureCyclone technology for strong, long-lasting suction.\nTineco Pure One Station\nThe Pure One Station's OmniHub stores the vacuum neatly, recharges and automatically cleans the entire machine from the brush to the tubes and filters. It's completely hands-free, with storage of debris and dust held for up to 60 days. Delivering a hassle-free experience, the ZeroTangle brush head prevents hair buildup in the roller, and PureCyclone technology separates air and dust to minimise clogging and sustain strong suction and power.\nRomeo Luo, General Manager of Tineco's International Business Unit, comments \"As a leader in the floor care industry, we are dedicated to providing assistance to every customer. We are proud to announce the Switch S7 as it was inspired by the real cleaning needs of our customers.

It will be available by end of March both on the official website of Tineco and on Amazon.\nThe unique design of the FLOOR ONE SWITCH S7 allows it not only to be used as a powerful mopping vacuum, but also as a stick or hand vacuum, by only switching the SWITCH Pro motor from one to the other. Once the brand-new FlashDry Self-cleaning System, which is quipped in the new device, heats up to 450W, the brush can be dried and disinfected in 5 minutes. In addition, the inserted upgraded Pouch Cell battery guarantees an extended device lifespan of three years. All wishes regarding functionality are fulfilled with the SWITCH S7.\nThis all-new home cleaning solution tackles every surface in the home, allowing vacuuming and mopping in one step, saving your time considerably and providing a thorough clean.\nFeatures of the FLOOR ONE Switch S7\nFlashDry system which allows deep self-cleaning and complete drying in just one press.\nPouch Cell battery - the device is equipped with this innovation, which allows the battery to see its lifespan multiplied by 3.\nMHCBS Technology guarantees impeccable floors. This technology effectively recycles dirty water using a brush scraper, continually washing and rinsing the device with clean water at a constant speed of 450 rotations per minute (RPM).\nZeroTangle brush provides a 99.99% reduction in hair and/or tangled hair and provides trouble-free suction.\nPureCyclone System (5-level filtration system) provides filtering of 99.97% of dust with a size of less than 0.3\u339b and effective separation of air and dust for long-lasting and powerful suction.\nSmoothPower system - Self-propelled, to operate the vacuum cleaner effortlessly.\nDouble-sided edge cleaning - Switch S7 head reaches up to 0.20 inch on both sides.\nLED headlight that illuminates all dirt.\nThe Tineco Switch S7 will be marketed later in March at a price of \u20ac899 on the official Tineco website and on Amazon.\nAbout Tineco\nTineco was founded in 1998 with the launch of its first vacuum cleaner and has been driving innovation in the smart household appliance category ever since. Tineco specializes in developing advanced, smart technologies that make everyday household products smarter and easier to use.

        "raw_content": "Tineco's Floor One Switch S7 Shines At CES 2024\nAt House Digest, we like to find products that make maintaining and cleaning homes more manageable than ever, so we sent one of our writers to the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 in Las Vegas to scout the latest and greatest home cleaning devices. CES is an annual trade show allowing brands to display their latest tech, but when seeking to determine the most innovative product at the dance, those that benefit the most people and offer remarkable, game-changing features are bound to stick out. Our two finalists came down to two vacuum models from Tineco: the Floor One Switch S7 and the Pure One Station Furfree.\nWhether you're a homeowner or a renter, you have floors that inevitably get dirty. So, naturally, the need for a solid vacuum (and mop!) is universal. Both of these mop vacuums have a suite of fantastic features, such as self-cleaning functionality, spectacular suction power, and high-quality filters. However, Tineco's Floor One Switch S7 got the slight edge, earning itself House Digest's Most Innovative Award at CES 2024. When it comes to vacuums, you're probably used to hearing about other brand names like Dyson, Shark, and Hoover, but this model from Tineco is a whole other animal.\nHow the Tineco Floor One Switch S7 stands out\nThe Floor One Switch S7's innovative features extend beyond its everyday uses (which there are plenty of) to make maintenance and upkeep a breeze. The S7 is a wet mop vacuum, and we've seen our fair share of these that are a nightmare to keep clean, between emptying the water, cleaning the mop pads, and worrying about mold developing in all those tiny crevices. While in cleaning mode, the S7 recycles dirty water at an impressive rate, which means it stays contained in the machine instead of being spread on the floors like a traditional mop and bucket. Even better, when back in its charging port, you can begin a self-cleaning and instant-drying function after each use, all at the press of a button. This eliminates the need for tiresome manual cleaning between uses \u2013 or a moldy surprise upon cracking open the unit weeks later.\nWe were equally impressed with the S7's specs. It's equipped with a top-of-the-line 5-level filter system that is able to capture even ultra-tiny dust and debris particles, which can improve the quality of the air in the home. It also comes with a special brush that prevents hair tangles \u2013 the bane of many premium vacuums \u2013 which is great if you or a furry friend tends to shed. (Take it from us, don't sweep pet hair from hard floors! Always use a vacuum.)\nThe usability is superior\nThe Floor One Switch S7 is proof that vacuum technology has come a long way in the last few years. Weighing in at just 22.93lbs in its stick mode, the S7 is lighter and easier to maneuver than a traditional upright canister vacuum with its power and feature set. It's also self-propelling, meaning you don't have to put your full force behind it to get it to glide. This is a huge bonus for anyone with mobility limitations, and a big reason it stands out from other wet vacuums at CES. The S7 is also multimodal, meaning it's able to operate as a stellar stick vacuum or can be detached to approach hard-to-reach areas by hand. This allows you to confidently take on both dirty floors and cobweb-leden corners without breaking a sweat.\nBeing lightweight, well-designed, and cordless, the S7 seems like a joy to push around one's floors. It's also impressively versatile, and can be used on all flooring types from carpet to hardwood. The idea of not having to swap out our broom, mop, and vacuum for each room and flooring type is a huge bonus when cleaning tasks never end. All of these factors and more are what made the S7 our clear choice for House Digest's Most Innovative Award for home cleaning devices at CES 2024."
