        "raw_content": "Kagan: The five most important technologies at CES 2024\nLast week at CES 2024 we learned quite a bit about what\u2019s new, what\u2019s coming next and what technologies will be in focus going forward. It is important that every investor, worker, customer, regulator and the media understand what is happening now and what\u2019s going to happen next.\nThere were at least five new technologies which will impact our world going forward, whether that be for consumers or business products and services. This new technology is changing the way we use and interact with a growing variety of products and services.\nTop influencers and thought leaders at CES 2024\nBefore we get started, let me first thank many tracking companies at CES2024. In the weeks leading up to the show and during the event itself, these companies and their reports have once again honored me by reporting Jeff Kagan is one of a few key thought leaders and tech influencers at the show and in the wider industry.\nThese studies and reports are from leading trackers like NodeXL, Brand24, TweetBinder, SEO Hashtag and others. I have not even seen them all yet, as they continue to pour in. I have begun to compile this list on my web site,\u00a0www.jeffKAGAN.com\nPull the camera back and get a solid understanding of what is happening\nNow, let\u2019s pull the camera back and get a good understanding of the changes that are occurring today and that are coming tomorrow.\nThere are several new and important technologies which will not only advance current products and services but will also create new ones.\nThe same way companies like Uber and Lyft first entered, then transformed the entire limousine and taxi industry. Or how the iPhone and Android changed wireless. Or how Tesla, Rivian and other electric car makers are showing new growth in automotive.\nThese new technologies were powerful change agents. And that is exactly what we should expect going forward.\nAI continues rapid growth and adoption in many companies and sectors\nThe private CES 2024 meetings I had with the CEOs and CMOs of more companies than I can count was a great start.\nNext, I am looking forward to more in-depth follow-up briefings with some of them, where my attention won\u2019t be distracted by the noise and chaos of the show.\nIn fact, this year I was overwhelmed by so many companies wanting to get on my radar. They got in touch with me because they want me to write about them, talk about them and help put them on the radar of users, investors, workers and the media.\nAt this year\u2019s event, I noticed that artificial intelligence and wireless were two of the exciting new areas noticed at many different sectors at the Consumer Electronics Show.\nIn fact, the new and different transformative technologies include AI, in all its forms, wireless, 5G, IoT, cloud and more. Sometimes these technologies work together, while other times they work independently.\nAI, chatbot, generative AI, conversational AI, wireless, IoT, cloud\nOne year ago, ChatGPT from OpenAI and Microsoft hit the marketplace and opened our eyes to this next generation of technology.\nChatGPT is one of many Chatbots that are popping up. Other include Bard and Gemini from Google, Grok from Elon Musk and Twitter, and others who are joining the list all the time. This Chatbot sector will continue its rapid growth in 2024 and beyond.\nHowever, there are also other new and exciting areas of AI which are also showing rapid growth. Areas like Generational AI, Conversational AI and others which are being introduced all the time.\nAI, wireless, IoT and cloud will play increasingly important role\nThat means AI will continue to expand on its rapid growth track. This is what we need to get comfortable with.\nDifferent slices of the AI pie are starting to show strong and rapid growth for the companies who develop the science, and both new and different tools for the people and the companies who use it.\nThat raises a real opportunity and challenge.\nThe challenge is AI is a fast-growing, loud and chaotic space. How to do lesser-known companies get found, get seen and heard in such a noisy industry?\nAI companies must find ways to be seen and heard in a noisy industry\nSmaller companies associated with larger companies, like OpenAI ChatGPT with Microsoft are on the radar because of their larger partner.\nOther large companies developing their own variety of AI are also on the radar because of who they are.\nHowever, the vast majority of new or smaller companies trying to get noticed are finding it a very difficult task.\nYou see, every competitor needs to crack-the-code and get seen and heard in the noisy and chaotic AI industry.\nAI is playing an increasingly important role with products, services\nConsider how other industries are using AI. The automotive industry with players like GM, Ford, Chrysler, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, BMW, Tesla, Rivian and many others are all rapidly moving in these new directions. They are capturing the spotlight.\nAt CES 2024, the Indy Autonomous Challenge was showing off their autonomous racing technology. Just think about it. Automated racing cars, without drivers, on the Las Vegas Speedway, racing at speeds that would make you dizzy.\nThere are quite a few major companies who are partnering with them as well.\nAnd we have only just begun to open this next chapter with regards to new technologies like AI, wireless, IoT and cloud in every other industry.\nAI, 5G and wireless are important breakthrough technologies\nAll that being said, from what I noticed at CES 2024, I would say these new technologies will transform every industry going forward.\nThat\u2019s the huge new growth opportunity and challenge for every company to crack-the-code and get noticed or discovered.\nNew technology uses wireless and AI to let your car, and in fact other electronic devices download updates to their systems on a regular basis. They do this not only to improve the service you get, but to introduce new ones as well.\nAI and wireless let products and services download updates automatically\nIt also let\u2019s autonomous driving cars keep up with changing traffic and road hazards by communicating with other vehicles in the cloud in the same area.\nAt CES 2024, industry after industry showed off brand new versions using these new technologies, which astounded everyone. Some are in the market today, while others are coming.\nIt is important to know what you are looking at. There are two different sides to keep an eye on.\nOne is the companies who develop AI technologies. The other are how those companies who use AI and other technology, gain a competitive advantage.\nFind companies who will be leaders for investment and employment\nToday, we are still in the very early stages of the new AI revolution. In these early days, many new companies and ideas will flourish.\nMany workers and investors prefer the companies on the growing side of the growth wave. Companies which create the technology. Others prefer existing companies who use it.\nBoth are worth considering. However, there are also many companies in the AI space today who simply will not make it in the long run.\nToday, we are all caught up in this new and magical time of invention and creation.\nToday is the time when all these smaller companies need to find ways to get on the radar of investors, workers, partners and customers.\nIn order to be a long-term success story every company, large or small need to rise above the noise of the chaotic industry. They need to be discovered.\nEvery company needs to punch their way into the marketplace\nEvery company needs to be seen and heard in order to succeed. They must punch their way onto the consciousness of the noisy industry.\nThat is both the challenge, and the opportunity companies face today.\nOver time, I have advised many companies on this topic. It\u2019s important to understand. It does not just happen. It takes a plan, effort and commitment. It\u2019s all about hard work, not magic. You must have a solid growth plan for your company, your technology and your industry.\nThat is the challenge faced by every investor and worker and in fact, every competitor.\nABOUT AUTHOR\nABOUT US\nSince 1982, RCR Wireless News has been providing wireless and mobile industry news, insights, and analysis to mobile and wireless industry professionals, decision makers, policy makers, analyst and investors.\nFOLLOW US\n\u00a9 2021-2022 RCR Wireless News"
