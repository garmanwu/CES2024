        "raw_content": "First listen: EarFun\u2019s first over-ear headphones are impressive for $80\nEarFun, a company that has been surprising us for several years with ultra-affordable wireless earbuds that sound terrific, has taken its first step into the over-ear wireless headphone space and we got a chance to give them a listen at CES 2024. The EarFun Wave Pro are priced at $80 and will be available toward the end of March.\nEarFun Wave Pro\nThe Wave Pro look impressive on paper. They\u2019ve got hybrid active noise cancellation (ANC), hi-res audio capability thanks to support for Sony\u2019s LDAC Bluetooth codec, Bluetooth Multipoint, 40mm drivers, five built-in mics for calls, and a huge 80-hour claimed battery life.\nIf the Wave Pro can repeat the performance of the company\u2019s wireless earbuds, they\u2019ll be the first wireless cans to provide some serious competition to 1More\u2019s $100 SonoFlow, which we currently consider to be the best budget wireless headphones you can buy.\nDigital Trends\u2019 own Derek Malcolm was in Las Vegas for the big electronics show and got some brief ears-on time with the Wave Pro at EarFun\u2019s booth. Admittedly, the CES show floor isn\u2019t necessarily an optimal space for auditioning audio products, but Malcolm nonetheless felt that they sounded good for the price, with a \u201cnice balance, and decent low end.\u201d He noted that the sound signature could probably do with some additional tweaking using the EarFun app\u2019s EQ adjustments.\nTen minutes is hardly a good test of long-term comfort, but the Wave Pro show promise in that area. Malcolm\u2019s immediate assessment was \u201ccomfy and not pinchy at all.\u201d Hear Through (transparency) mode made external voices easier to hear thanks to some amplification, and the only real critique was in regard to the ANC, which he dubbed \u201conly OK.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the final word on the Wave Pro \u2014 we\u2019ll be doing a full review as soon as we get a chance to spend some more considered time with them closer to launch.\nEarFun also debuted new generations of some of its most popular wireless earbuds and speakers at CES:\nEarFun Air 2\nEarFun UBoom X\nEarFun Air Pro 4\nOnly days ahead of the official start of CES 2024, JLab has given us a look at its continuing move into higher-performance audio with the $80 JBuds Lux ANC Wireless Headphones. They can be preordered starting January 3 in four different colors: white, graphite, sage, and mauve, with shipping expected to start as soon as late February.\nJLab is also debuting its latest budget-priced noise-canceling wireless earbuds, the $60 JBuds ANC 3 True Wireless Earbuds, available in black, starting January 3.\nA headphone diagram from a Sonos patent application. Sonos/USPO\nIf the many rumors, leaks, and teasing by the CEO are true, Sonos is on the cusp of releasing its first wireless headphones in 2024, and the benefits to Sonos\u2019 customers could be considerable. Being able to use one set of headphones for travel, office, and home use -- that also integrate with the Sonos ecosystem of whole-home wireless speakers \u2014 would be convenient.\nIn 2023, we saw plenty of great new wireless headphones and wireless earbuds emerge, like the Bose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones, Bose QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds, Anker Soundcore Liberty 4 NC, Sony WF-1000XM5, and the new USB-C variant of the Apple AirPods Pro 2.\nEach of these products delivers better performance than its predecessors in one or more categories like sound quality, active noise cancellation (ANC), battery life, or spatial audio. But for a product to be considered innovative, it can't just offer incremental improvements. It needs to break new ground by offering us something new or by getting us to think about an existing feature in an entirely new way.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best audio tech at CES 2024: next-gen wireless headphones, speakers and more\nThe 23 best audio products and concepts we saw at CES 2024\nTo say that CES 2024 has delighted and surprised us is an understatement, with audio innovations, wireless wizardry and great-sounding gadgets taking their place upfront and center stage (and rightly so).\nCES 2024 proper kicked off on Tuesday, January 9 and ran until Friday, January 12, 2024 (oh, we didn't want it to end!), and over the course of the event, manufacturers from BREGGZ to Bose, EarFun to FiiO, Hidizs to Kanto, Naqi to Sonos, Sony to Victrola and myriad more showed off their latest audio tech, concept ideas, prototypes and ready-for-market products.\nThe sonic treats unveiled will soon be vying for a spot on our best headphones, best turntables, and best wireless earbuds lists, once we can get our hands on them and put them through our fully star-rated review process. That said, we've had people on the ground in Las Vegas throughout the event, so our ears-on coverage might be all that's needed for you to decide whether a product is worth snapping up now \u2013 or as soon as its hits the shelves.\nWe've rounded up the 23 most exciting audio tech announcements revealed at CES 2024 \u2013 so strap in and get comfortable, there's plenty here to enjoy.\nSpeakers, turntables, streamers and, er\u2026 cassette players\nWant to improve your home theater surround-sound system or upgrade your speakers? CES 2024 is the place to find out what's hot right now; we've been treated to a veritable smorgasbord of home audio solutions.\nFirst up is the unique LG Labs DukeBox (above), a concept translucent OLED screen-toting valve amp jukebox with fireside visuals \u2013\u00a0yes, that's really as good a summary as we can muster. Billed as \"an innovative audio product that seamlessly combines the charm of vacuum tube audio with cutting-edge transparent OLED panel technology\", we have to admire the idea: classic sensibilities mixed with state-of-the-art technology.\nElsewhere, Sonus Faber unveiled arguably the most high-ticket item at CES, the Sonus Faber Suprema speaker system, yours for a cool $750,000 (and who's to say it isn't worth every last cent?). At the other end of the food chain, JBL brought special sonic Auracast powers to its most lovable and affordable next-gen JBL Clip 5 speaker.\nOn that note, our very own Matt Bolton attended a very special Auracast demo at CES involving faux airport lounges and the like, and he truly believes the audio broadcasting tech will change our relationship with our headphones \u2013 and with each other.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X is a five-strong lineup of Focal speakers unveiled at CES \u2013 and, frankly, we think the availability of a moss green finish option alone makes it the floorstander to beat at CES.\nIf you want a speaker around which to build a multi-room wireless audio system or one to connect to a turntable, the new Audio Pro C20 could be it. I've written\u00a0love letters to this firm's stunning speaker output, and with the slightly bigger C20, the company has broadened its already extensive connectivity options.\nBy adding a phono stage, Audio Pro's new speaker can be plugged straight into your turntable, allowing you to simply power it on, lower that needle and get into the groove! Of course, this is Audio Pro (maker of some of the\u00a0best wireless speakers\u00a0on the planet), so the new C20 also features AirPlay 2,\u00a0Google\u00a0Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth, ARC and multi-room capability, too.\nDon't have a turntable yet? Don't you worry, we've just the thing\u2026\nIf it's a new plate-spinner you're after, Victrola's extensive CES rollout included a slew of hot decks. Our favorite? We've narrowed it down to either the Victrola Automatic, a fully automatic turntable with a first-of-its-kind \"Repeat\" feature to continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record, or the Victrola Stream Sapphire (pictured above), the company's new best-in-class flagship wireless turntable, which now works with multiple streaming ecosystems. What makes it so good? The Victrola Stream Sapphire builds on the DNA of Victrola\u2019s inaugural October 2022 Stream deck \u2013\u00a0which you can learn about in our dedicated\u00a0Victrola Stream Carbon review\u00a0\u2013 by expanding on its connectivity solutions, to stream vinyl in \"stunning clarity\" to UPnP and Roon-integrated systems as well as Sonos, plus support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nIf that\u2019s not old-school enough, feast your eyes on this ode to the original 1979 Sony Walkman, the FiiO C13. That's right, we came to CES 2024 and saw a portable cassette player. There's no Bluetooth, so forget wireless listening (this is real retro; you've got to live it), plus the only new-fangled feature is the USB-C charging port, so you won't need to keep buying batteries. It does have a rewind button, though, so there will be no flipping the tape over and fast-forwarding to go back to the start of your jam, right before the beat drops.\nBack to the future (see what we did there) of audio and FiiO's been busy here, too \u2013check out the little bijou music maestro above, the FiiO R9. In a nutshell, it's the compact music system with smartphone-esque screen I need in my life, because it's so multi-faceted it's hard to know what to call it. DAC/amp streamer? Music hub? Entire just-add-speakers music streaming system?\u00a0It's all of these things \u2013 and, refreshingly, it takes up about the same room in you home as a houseplant.\nFiiO calls it a \"flagship desktop audio player/streamer & balanced DAC/amplifier\". We call it a fantastically featured and great-looking little proposition.\nSoundbars\nAdding a soundbar (or upgrading the one you have) can add oodles of separation, immersion and bass clout to your home entertainment setup, and CES 2024 has delivered standard \"bar-and-sub\" propositions and quirky space-saving options in equal measure.\nTake Samsung, which revealed its 2024 soundbar lineup at CES, headlined by the Samsung HW-Q990D (above), which is the successor to the fantastic\u00a0Samsung HW-Q990C \u2013 one of the\u00a0best Dolby Atmos soundbars\u00a0available. It has 11.1.4 channels (the same as the Q990C), supports wireless Dolby Atmos, and now comes with\u00a04K\u00a0120Hz passthrough for games consoles, something the Q990C lacked. There\u2019s also Party Play mode, which tunes the HW-Q990D to play a balanced sound across the whole system when listening to music, so everyone has the same experience.\nSamsung had an ace up its sleeve, though \u2013 the Music Frame. It's essentially a picture frame that's also a wireless speaker and/or subwoofer, and I think that is both a great idea and a very bad one, in equal measure.\nLook, we adore\u00a0Samsung's The Frame TV, which happily becomes an electronic art gallery\u00a0when you're not bingeing the entire series of Beef on Netflix \u2013\u00a0and as our IKEA-meets-Sonos\u00a0Symfonisk Picture Frame with Wi-Fi Speaker review\u00a0proves, we love an audio solution boasting space-saving style and substance.\u00a0Samsung tells us the Samsung HW-LS60D (aka the technical name for the Music Frame) is the world\u2019s first customizable and personalized wireless speaker with built-in IoT hub, and it's meant to \"be used as a TV speaker, rear speaker, or a subwoofer \u2013 and even pair two for more surround sound options\".\nMusic Frame also boasts Dolby Atmos support and hides two woofers, two tweeters, and two mid-drivers behind your chosen photo (you can digitally print your favorite memories onto the accompanying \"Art Panel\"; a Diasec matte acrylic plate).\nFrom an audio perspective, we must remain cautious: the Music Frame is literally meant to hang on a wall, which\u00a0should\u00a0mean vibrations, articles, echo \u2013 all of the audio nasties. Then again, we love the space-saving, art-loving concept and this is Samsung, after all, so we'll reserve judgement until we've heard it properly.\nHeadphones and earbuds\nCES 2024 has seen a swathe of fantastic wireless earbuds, so it might seem odd to be kicking off with a relatively humble-looking pair (by today's standards) from EarFun. But the EarFun Wave Pro aren't just the company's first ever stab at over-ear headphones; they're also LDAC and hi-res certified, offer noise cancellation and a whopping 80-hour battery life, all for $79.99. Suffice to say, we can't wait to hear them.\nScreens on earbuds' cases are definitely a thing at CES 2024 \u2013 Samsung unveiled a Galaxy Buds case with an OLED screen, but said it had no plans to actually release it, while JBL is sticking to its screen-enhanced earbuds lineup with the new JBL Live 3. They come in three different designs, but they all have one feature in common: JBL's touchscreen Smart Charging Case, which is designed to make it much easier and quicker to access your audio playback and your earbuds' various features \u2013 it's like having a smartwatch screen right on the case.\nWe first saw JBL's screen-enhanced case in the JBL Tour Pro 2, and were fans initially: in our\u00a0JBL Tour Pro 2 review we said that the case was \"a thing of beauty\". However, the novelty kind of wore off, over time, in favor of our trusty phone and JBL's excellent companion app.\nThere are three options in the JBL Live 3 range: Buds, Beam and Flex. As with their current incarnations, the Buds 3 look most like standard earbuds; the Beam 3 are like\u00a0Apple's AirPods Pro, sporting a stick design and an in-ear fit; the Flex 3 are like regular AirPods, with a stick design but no silicone tip that sits right in the ear canal. All three have JBL's True Adaptive Noise Cancelling and\u00a0Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio.\nThe next big thing in portable listening gear at CES 2024? Neural headphones. If the idea of your headphones being able to read your mind doesn't sit easy with you, calm yourself with the thought that products such as the CES Innovation Award honoree Naqi Neural Earbuds and NeurGear ZenBud are designed not to neurohack your noggin and control your actions, but to help you out \u2013\u00a0either by giving you full, hands-free control over your Windows or Mac computer, including typing, browsing, online shopping and gaming (Naqi); or by stimulating your Vagus nerve using ultrasonic sound waves to relax you (NeurGear).\nWe've been covering similar tech since June of last year, with the Neurable headphones. It seems the idea really is here to stay, and if it could potentially act as a safe and non-invasive alternative to brain implants, we're all for it.\nElsewhere, BREGGZ has unveiled a new \"hearable\": made-to-measure earbuds that both promise a custom fit better than even hand-made molds. They're are also being touted as \"the world\u2019s first truly wireless, custom-made in-ear computer\".\nIn a resoundingly positive nod to sustainability, BREGGZ's IEMs also utilize a unique, patented \"one-box\" technology, where all of the hardware and firmware is processed in a mini cartridge, which can be easily replaced if (or when) the user wants to upgrade to a newer version, or following a battery charge decrease over time.\nBut what of the heavy-hitters? Sennheiser has unveiled the new Momentum True Wireless 4 along with the Accentum Plus, and Momentum Sport for every kind of listener \u2013\u00a0but the headline grabber is the Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds, billed as \"Sennheiser's most capable earbud yet\". They're built around the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform \u2013 which is also going to be a really big deal in 2024 \u2013 and Snapdragon Sound, which means aptX lossless sound quality, as well as exceptionally low latency. The Bluetooth version is 5.4 with confirmed support for\u00a0Auracast, improved ANC, something Sennheiser calls \"evolved tuning\", and upgraded batteries to boot.\nAlso landing were the Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7 wireless earbuds \u2013 chic, hi-res Audio-Technica earbuds with LDAC streaming for less \u2013 and, in the wired realm, the Hidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs, which not only boast hi-res audio support but also a DAC built into the USB-C connector.\nIt's a simple audiophile-friendly solution that means levelling up your wired audio with a separate DAC dongle to get the goods will no longer be necessary \u2013 making the ST2 Pro almost certainly a serious audio upgrade for your iPhone 15, Android phone, Mac or PC.\nHi-Fi acessories\nTechRadar's Josephine Watson (Managing Editor, Lifestyle) tried Nanoleaf's new music-syncing software at CES, and discovered that house parties will never be the same. Nanoleaf announced a spring 2024 release along with\u00a0news of its new outdoor lights\u00a0(which she also saw at CES, and they're\u00a0gorgeous), describing the software as \u00a0a \u201creal-time audio-visual experience\u201d.\nNanoleaf Orchestrator is a new desktop-based music interpretation engine that actually analyzes your music itself, to create a comprehensive light show with your devices. Not only can Orchestrator create a palette of colors based on your chosen song's vibe or mood, it also lets you customize which lights respond to which musical passages or frequencies of a song.\u00a0Want your bulbs to pulse along with the bassline while your smart light panels react to the mids or highs? Done.\nWant to take your music out of your home and on the road? TechRadar's Senior Editor of Home Entertainment, Al Griffin, has you covered. He got to experience a Mercedes-Benz S 580 tricked out with a 4D sound system furnished by German manufacturer Burmester at CES. The 31-speaker Burmester 4D configuration is an option for the latest MBUX-generation infotainment system in Mercedes-Benz vehicles, and it allows for Atmos-compatible tracks to be streamed in an immersive format from\u00a0Apple\u00a0Music and\u00a0Amazon\u00a0Music.

An all-new over-ear ANC wireless headphones named the Wave Pro is the company's first pair of hybrid active noise canceling over-ear wireless headphones. EarFun will also be adding a new portable wireless Bluetooth speaker to their lineup called the UBOOM X, details further below.\nThe Wave Pro will offer an outstanding hybrid active-noise cancellation performance of up to 45dB, and feature an instantaneous Anti-Wind Noise technology that quells jarring wind shears. Receiving Hi-Res Audition certification, the Wave Pro additionally features LDAC audio codec support. As a result, listeners can expect three times more data compared to standard Bluetooth transfer rates versions. This translates into a truly high-res audio experience with greater fidelity and dimensionality to be experienced with music and other media. To deliver the high-resolution experience, the Wave Pro is driven by a pair of expertly-refined 40mm DLC composite film dynamic coil speakers. Together, the powerful drivers and high-resolution certifications can achieve rich detail with a frequency response up to 40kHz, while delivering deep, immersive bass, for a versatile, dynamic sound signature.\nWhile on the go, the Wave Pro can confidently take calls with the inclusion of advanced ENC tech and a 5-Microphone AI-powered algorithm that keeps calls clear and voices easily distinguishable. With an 80-hour battery life, the Wave Pro is a true wireless workhorse. The pair of ANC wireless headphones has fast charging, with a short 10-minute charge offering a lengthy 10 hours of playback. And if you prefer a wired connection, an auxiliary port is available. When it comes to its design, the Wave Pro housing is ultra-comfortable thanks to its lightweight and sensible ergonomics. Its multipoint connection makes it easy to keep the headphones on while instantly changing between connected Bluetooth devices, or activating any of its supported voice assistants. The Wave Pro also features a dedicated Game Mode, achieving extremely low-latency (<55ms), perfect for both gaming and streaming.\n80 Watts of True Audio Portability\nThe second product to be released by EarFun during CES 2024 is the new UBOOM X. Adding to its current line-up of award-winning speakers of the same series, this newly designed speaker will pump out a whopping 80 watts of power using four drivers (two 4-inch mid-woofers and two 20mm silk dome tweeters). With exclusive JumboBass\u2122 technology, the UBOOM X can generate well defined bass outdoors. EarFun's proprietary water-resistant tech called SweatShieldTM along with IPX7 waterproofing will protect the wireless Bluetooth speaker from water and sweat. However, its most notable feature is the ability to synchronize with up to 50 other UBOOM X speakers, resulting in a truly immersive audio experience. Moreover, the dynamic LED lighting on the exterior can be customized to your liking, creating a striking visual display that's truly unique. Whether you're hosting a party or simply relaxing at home, the UBOOM X speaker is designed to deliver exceptional sound quality and stunning aesthetics that are sure to impress.\nWith playback up to 30 hours, USB-C quick charging, and an integrated carrying handle and strap, the lightweight UBOOM X is a perfect Travel Mate. For those who want to leave their smartphone charger behind, the speaker provides an outlet for charging mobile devices. The UBOOM X can also serve as an extension of the gaming experience, with Bluetooth 5.3 and ultra-low latency. The speaker will also benefit from personalization through the compatible EarFun Audio app. An embedded microphone is built in, allowing calls to be taken. The Bluetooth speaker also supports Google Assist and Siri voice assistants.\nEarFun at CES 2024\nEarFun continues to redefine the audio landscape, offering consumers unparalleled experiences in both personal and shared entertainment. Visit our Booth No.: 53067-Venetian Expo Hall at CES 2024 to witness these groundbreaking products firsthand.\nThese two cutting-edge products are set to launch in March and June.

An all-new over-ear ANC wireless headphones named the Wave Pro is the company's first pair of hybrid active noise canceling over-ear wireless headphones. EarFun will also be adding a new portable wireless Bluetooth speaker to their lineup called the UBOOM X, details further below.\nThe Wave Pro will offer an outstanding hybrid active-noise cancellation performance of up to 45dB, and feature an instantaneous Anti-Wind Noise technology that quells jarring wind shears. Receiving Hi-Res Audition certification, the Wave Pro additionally features LDAC audio codec support. As a result, listeners can expect three times more data compared to standard Bluetooth transfer rates versions. This translates into a truly high-res audio experience with greater fidelity and dimensionality to be experienced with music and other media. To deliver the high-resolution experience, the Wave Pro is driven by a pair of expertly-refined 40mm DLC composite film dynamic coil speakers. Together, the powerful drivers and high-resolution certifications can achieve rich detail with a frequency response up to 40kHz, while delivering deep, immersive bass, for a versatile, dynamic sound signature.\nWhile on the go, the Wave Pro can confidently take calls with the inclusion of advanced ENC tech and a 5-Microphone AI-powered algorithm that keeps calls clear and voices easily distinguishable. With an 80-hour battery life, the Wave Pro is a true wireless workhorse. The pair of ANC wireless headphones has fast charging, with a short 10-minute charge offering a lengthy 10 hours of playback. And if you prefer a wired connection, an auxiliary port is available. When it comes to its design, the Wave Pro housing is ultra-comfortable thanks to its lightweight and sensible ergonomics. Its multipoint connection makes it easy to keep the headphones on while instantly changing between connected Bluetooth devices, or activating any of its supported voice assistants. The Wave Pro also features a dedicated Game Mode, achieving extremely low-latency (<55ms), perfect for both gaming and streaming.\n80 Watts of True Audio Portability\nThe second product to be released by EarFun during CES 2024 is the new UBOOM X. Adding to its current line-up of award-winning speakers of the same series, this newly designed speaker will pump out a whopping 80 watts of power using four drivers (two 4-inch mid-woofers and two 20mm silk dome tweeters). With exclusive JumboBass\u2122 technology, the UBOOM X can generate well defined bass outdoors. EarFun's proprietary water-resistant tech called SweatShieldTM along with IPX7 waterproofing will protect the wireless Bluetooth speaker from water and sweat. However, its most notable feature is the ability to synchronize with up to 50 other UBOOM X speakers, resulting in a truly immersive audio experience. Moreover, the dynamic LED lighting on the exterior can be customized to your liking, creating a striking visual display that's truly unique. Whether you're hosting a party or simply relaxing at home, the UBOOM X speaker is designed to deliver exceptional sound quality and stunning aesthetics that are sure to impress.\nWith playback up to 30 hours, USB-C quick charging, and an integrated carrying handle and strap, the lightweight UBOOM X is a perfect Travel Mate. For those who want to leave their smartphone charger behind, the speaker provides an outlet for charging mobile devices. The UBOOM X can also serve as an extension of the gaming experience, with Bluetooth 5.3 and ultra-low latency. The speaker will also benefit from personalization through the compatible EarFun Audio app. An embedded microphone is built in, allowing calls to be taken. The Bluetooth speaker also supports Google Assist and Siri voice assistants.\nEarFun at CES 2024\nEarFun continues to redefine the audio landscape, offering consumers unparalleled experiences in both personal and shared entertainment. Visit our Booth No.: 53067-Venetian Expo Hall at CES 2024 to witness these groundbreaking products firsthand.\nThese two cutting-edge products are set to launch in March and June.

Reviews ethics statement\nEarfun, a Leader in Budget Earbuds, Is Finally Doing Over-Ear ANC Headphones\nThe Earfun Wave Pro headphones are coming in March. They'll have a list price of $80, are rated for up to 80 hours of battery life and support the LDAC audio codec.\nThe Earfun Wave Pro headphones are due to ship in March for $80.\nEarfun has consistently released decent-sounding noise-canceling earbuds in the $30-$70 price range that offer good bang for your buck. It also makes portable Bluetooth speakers but until now hasn't offered over-ear noise-canceling headphones. That's about to change in March, as we'll see the new Wave Pro headphones hit Amazon, Earfun announced at CES 2024. They'll list for $80 but could end up costing closer to $70 with discounts, based on how Earfun has priced its products in the past.\nRead more: Best of Show CES 2024\nEarfun is billing the Wave Pro as high-res headphones. They have 40mm \"Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) composite film dynamic coil\" drivers and feature LDAC audio codec support when paired with devices like Android smartphones that support LDAC streaming over Bluetooth (LDAC is capable of delivering audio at higher bit rates so you may see a slight bump in audio quality if you use a high-res streaming service such as Qobuz, Tidal or Amazon Music).\nEarfun says the 268-gram Wave Pro is equipped with a \"5-Microphone AI-powered algorithm\" for voice calling, a low-latency (<55ms) game mode, multipoint Bluetooth pairing and an auxiliary port for wired listening (there's no mention of USB-C audio). Battery life is rated at up to 80 hours with noise-canceling off and 55 hours with it on and a 10-minute charge gets you 10 hours of listening time.\nRead more:\u00a0The Race to Move Beyond Phone Apps Was in Full Swing at CES 2024\nWhile I haven't tried the Wave Pro headphones yet, at first glance they seem to check a lot of boxes for what you might hope for in a pair of value headphones. If they manage to sound as good as Earfun says they do -- or even 75% as good -- and also be comfortable, they could make out a list of the\u00a0best noise-canceling headphones under $100.\nWave Pro's key specs, according to Earfun:\nAt CES, Earfun also unveiled a new Bluetooth boom box speaker, the UBoom X ($180), which is due to ship in June and will compete with Tribit's Stormbox Blast and Soundcore by Anker's Motion Boom Plus speakers. I suspect its real price will be less than $150.\nThe UBoom X is due to ship in June for $180.\nUBoom X's key specs, according to Earfun:\nI'll have hands-on reviews of both products when they're released later this year.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nMobile Guides\nPhones\nFoldable Phones\nHeadphones\nMobile Accessories\nSmartwatches\nWireless Plans"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest headphones and earbuds of CES 2024 so far\nAll the new models I can't wait to try out\nCES 2024\u00a0is officially underway and there are plenty of audio announcements to get excited about. Although it's only Day 1 and the event is only just getting going, from what we've seen so far, 2024 looks like a big year for headphones. Especially those fitted with the latest tech developments to enhance the user experience in ways we never imagined.\nThere have been plenty of tech news stories filtering through from big and small audio brands attending the world's largest consumer electronics show, unveiling intriguing new developments for the year ahead.\nFrom Wi-Fi headphones and wireless earbuds that are capable of achieving the best-ever audio quality over Bluetooth, to headphones that help you work more productively and smart accessories that change the way we interact with our wireless earbuds. CES 2024 really does have something for every kind of headphones listener.\nHere's my pick of the 5 best headphones and wireless earbuds at CES 2024 so far.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\n1. Unity headphones\nAlthough officially unveiled in April 2023, Unity's headphones have been causing a stir among the high-end audio fraternity for their full lossless audio support up to 24-bit/96kHz from networked devices and streaming services over Wi-Fi. They're also equipped with storage for a small hi-res music library, Bluetooth connectivity, and come bundled with an adapter for wired listening, meaning you're covered for those times when Wi-Fi connectivity isn't available.\nFitted with dual-core processor, memory, storage, and a 9-axis IMU for accurate head-tracking motion detection for codec agnostic decoding of spatial and immersive audio in real-time, they are one of the most high-end audio developments we've seen in the wireless headphones market in recent years.\nUnlike most of the models being shown at CES 2024, the Unity headphones are already on sale. You'll need deep pockets though as they cost $2,199 / \u00a31,765 / AU$3,265 via the getunity.com website. Look out for our full review coming soon.\n2. Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro\nKicking off CES 2024 by winning a CES Innovation Award, the Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro headphones have already made a significant impact at the Las Vegas show as one of the first electroencephalogram (EEG)-enabled wearables intended for the consumer market.\nMade in partnership with the Neurable AI platform announced in December, they integrate neurotechnology into a new version of Master & Dynamic's popular MW75 noise-canceling headphones with sensors integrated into the fabric parts of the frame. The sensors are designed to track the wearer's brainwaves to help them identify focus periods, recognize signs of stress, and discover optimal mental well-being conditions analyzed via a Neurable AI app for iOS or Android. Neurable says that the data is stored in secured locations in an encrypted and de-identified form.\nThe Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro headphones are available to pre-order now via the\u00a0neurable website costing $649 (around \u00a3510 / AU$669).\n3. Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nOne of the key features grabbing my attention from Sennheiser's trio of new models announced at CES 2024 is the introduction of the next-gen Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds with aptX Lossless Audio and Auracast support.\nBuilt on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology, the Bluetooth 5.4 connectivity with ultra-low latency and lossless audio allows them to stream music at higher quality via compatible playback devices.\nBolstering this is Auracast, which enables wireless streaming to an unlimited number of nearby audio devices. The new premium wireless earbuds by Sennheiser are the first I've heard of to officially mention the feature since it was announced by the Bluetooth Special Interest Group (SIG)\u00a0in 2022. It's an exciting development that feels a long time coming, and could mean that wearers are able to listen in to devices in public spaces such as TVs at airports, waiting rooms, and gyms, as well as public address system announcements, bringing accessibility and assistive listening to the next level.\nThe Momentum True Wireless 4 wireless earbuds are expected to be available to pre-order from the\u00a0Sennheiser website\u00a0from February 15 priced at $299 / \u00a3259 / (approx. AU$499).\n4. JBL Live TWS 3 Series\nFocussing more on the smart charging case than the audio tech inside these mid-priced wireless earbuds, the JBL's Live TWS 3 Series earbuds look to continue JBL's desire to shake up the humble charging case and change the way we interact with them.\nI confess that I didn't see the development coming. But it's one that's proving very popular, and borrows tech from the much-loved JBL Tour Pro 2 ($249) wireless earbuds that arrived this time last year. The new series comes in 3 wearing styles, including Buds, Beam and Flex solutions with the different designs built to match your requirements depending on your lifestyle.\nThe updated charging case brings JBL's 1.45-inch LED touchscreen tech to all three designs in the series, and makes the charging case the main control device. Owners will have full control of almost all features and functions without needing to access the JBL Headphones app.\nAs well as the smart charging case, the buds are said to be equipped with Bluetooth 5.3 with LE (available via a later OTA update) and are IP55-rated against water and dust.\nThey will be available in four new colorways including purple, blue, silver and black. The price is expected to be $199 / \u00a3179 / \u20ac199 when they go on sale at JBL.com from mid-June 2024. Look out for our full review nearer the time.\n5. Shokz OpenSwim Pro\nIf you like listening to music or podcasts while you're wild water swimming or pacing up and down the lanes of the indoor pool, then Shokz' OpenSwim Pro is made for you. Unlike the original Shokz OpenSwim that had only 4GB of storage and no wireless connectivity, the Pro's are Bluetooth and MP3 compatible sports bone-conduction headphones, meaning you can stream your favorite audio content both in and out of the water. They have 32GB storage capacity, which means they're capable of storing up to 8,000 tracks at MP3 quality.\nLike the original Shokz OpenSwim that rank at the top of the\u00a0best waterproof headphones for swimming, the new Pro version have an open-ear design and an ultra-lightweight frame that the company says makes them the perfect design for swimming, running or cycling, while still maintaining situational awareness.\nUse under water\nDesigned with Shokz\u2019 PremiumPitch 2.0+ technology, the headphones produce clear sound, powerful volume, and a rich bass. There are three EQ modes \u2014 a swimming mode, vocal booster mode and standard mode. They also work for phone calls and are fitted with two microphones and echo cancellation.\nThe OpenSwim Pro have an IP68 rating allowing users to use their headphones for up to\u00a0two hours submerged in two meters of water. Users can also expect up to nine hours of battery life, combined with quick charging. They're said to transition seamlessly between devices, thanks to multipoint pairing and the use of Bluetooth v5.3 providing a quick and stable connection.\nAlthough there's no exact release date available just yet for the OpenSwim Pro, Shokz says that the on-sale date and price will be confirmed in the coming weeks.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThese budget headphones boast an 80-hour battery life \u2013 and they might sound good, too\nThere's also a new portable Bluetooth speaker on the way\nCES 2024 is here, and that means lots of new product reveals to enjoy. EarFun isn't keen to miss out on the action, and has used the Las Vegas consumer technology event to showcase two new products at the affordable end of the audio market: the EarFun Wave Pro over-ear wireless headphones and the EarFun UBoom X portable Bluetooth speaker.\nThose are two highly competitive sectors, so what are the new products bringing to the table? Let's start with the EarFun Wave Pro headphones, the brand's first-ever pair of over-ear cans which offer hybrid ANC and support for the Sony-made LDAC codec for, in theory at least, streaming high-resolution audio up to 32-bit/96kHz.\nTo get your music going, the new Wave Pro are driven by a pair of 40mm dynamic coil speakers which, according to EarFun, produce \"rich detail\" and \"deep, immersive bass for a versatile, dynamic sound signature\".\nMost impressively, EarFun claims the new cans come equipped with a whopping 80-hour battery life, with a fast charging feature supposedly providing 10 hours of playback from a 10-minute charge. There's also voice control tech for taking hands-free calls, as well as a low-latency game mode for faster audio response times for gamers and streamers alike. We've liked a lot of EarFun's cheapest wireless buds, including 2021's EarFun Air Pro and 2019's EarFun Air, even if more recent models have gone off the boil a little, making the brand's first forays into over-ear cans an interesting prospect for 2024.\nEarFun isn't done there. Keen to keep pushing into the world of portable speakers, the Chinese brand has announced the UBoom X as a new addition to its current line-up of Bluetooth models (see the smaller UBoom L, for instance). The rather burly UBoom X promises to pump out 80 watts of power using four drive units, while EarFun's \"JumboBass\" tech gives plenty of beef to the low end.\nIt's rugged, too, with an IPX7 waterproof rating, and you can even sync up the UBoom X with up to 50 other models of the same type, similar to JBL's own Connect Plus and PartyBoost features, and you'll be able to control and customise your listening experience via the EarFun Audio app.\nPlayback is up to 30 hours on a single charge which, combined with a carrying handle and strap, should make the UBoom X ideal for on-the-go listening. Like the Award-winning JBL Charge 5, EarFun's new speaker also has a USB port for charging up your mobile device, and it even supports Google Assistant and Siri voice controls.\nThe new EarFun Wave Pro over-ear headphones will retail for $80, whereas the EarFun UBoom portable Bluetooth speaker will set you back $180 (further prices pending). That puts the Wave Pro up against the Award-winning, best-in-class Sony 720N over ears, while the UBoom X sits in direct competition with the Award-winning Charge 5 Bluetooth speaker.\nMORE:\nThese are our pick of the best cheap wireless earbuds\nThese are the best Bluetooth speakers in the game\nLike EarFun?

See our ethics statement.\nThe best audio products of CES 2024\nEvery year, we filter out the noise at CES to find the most innovative audio announcements. Across headphones, speakers, and more, we look for the products that we think will be most important to consumers in 2024 and beyond. This year, we met with dozens of audio companies and saw hundreds of new audio products. We have hand-selected the top products that caught our eye from everything announced at the show. Here are the best audio products of CES 2024!\nThe Sennheiser MOMENTUM Sport brings advanced biometric tracking to wireless earbuds\nWith an integrated photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor, the Sennheiser MOMENTUM Sport outputs biometric data directly to popular fitness devices and apps. This makes it easy to track your workouts in Apple Health, Garmin Connect, Strava, Polar, Peloton, and more. Designed for runners, the earbuds have an acoustic relief channel to minimize noise from your footsteps. The MOMENTUM Sport also has a semi-open design for environmental awareness, alongside adjustable transparency mode, anti-wind mode, and adaptive noise canceling. With IP55 water and dust resistance, and a shock-proof chassis, these are the top fitness earbuds we saw at CES 2024.\nWith the MOMENTUM True Wireless 4, Sennheiser brings the latest connectivity technology\nSennheiser delivered another exciting product with the MOMENTUM True Wireless 4. Built on the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform with Snapdragon Sound, these buds from Sennheiser have the latest and greatest in connectivity technology. Bluetooth 5.4 with Auracast supports future-proofs the MOMENTUM True Wireless 4, while aptX lossless and low-latency provide an exceptional connection to most devices today. The earbuds also bring improved adaptive ANC, new tuning, and an upgraded battery system.\nThe JBL Extreme 4 is built to last with a replaceable battery\nThe JBL Extreme 4 has a ton of features that elevate it above your standard portable Bluetooth speaker. Using what JBL calls AI Sound Boost, the speaker analyzes incoming audio in real-time to deliver the maximum output level without distortion. The speaker now has a user-replaceable battery that works with some of JBL\u2019s other speakers, such as the new PartyBox speakers, which will extend the lifespan once the battery has worn out. Made with 70% post-consumer recycled (PCR) plastic, this speaker is future-proof with Auracast support for multi-speaker connection.\nThe Live 3 Earbuds feature touchscreen controls and multiple fit options\nPreviously seen on the JBL Tour Pro 2, JBL has now brought touchscreen controls to the more affordable JBL Live 3 series of earbuds. The touchscreen on the charging case gives you full control over all of the functionality normally found in the JBL companion app. The Live 3 comes in three design styles: Buds, Beam, and Flex. Buds is a closed bud-style earbud without a stem, Beam is a closed stick-style earbud with a stem, and Flex is an open design for increased awareness. Later this year, JBL will be launching an at-home earbud fit test that will scan your ears using your phone camera to determine the shape and size of your ears, and then ask a series of questions about how you plan to use your earbuds. With this information, the software will suggest which of the three design options is best for you.\nMojawa HaptiFit Terra brings Ai to bone conduction\nThe Mojawa HaptiFit Terra was a surprise to see at CES 2024. It has all the capabilities of devices like the Shokz OpenSwim Pro but adds AI-enhanced training features to bone-conduction listening. This device can talk to you with real-time workout metrics and vital signs, keeping athletes informed. It has an IP68 waterproof rating, so you can wear it underwater, pressure-sensitive haptic controls, adjustable safety lights for visibility, substantial music storage of 32GB, and a battery life of eight hours. Additionally, its companion app not only tracks athletic progress but also offers customizable exercise plans and training regimes. The HaptiFit Terra\u2019s comprehensive approach to training assistance and athlete safety is what truly caught our eye, making it a worthy recipient of our awards.\nEnjoy advanced headphone features at an affordable price with the EarFun Wave Pro\nThe EarFun Wave Pro headphones offer some pretty great features at an accessible price point. These headphones have hybrid active noise cancelation (ANC), capable of reducing up to 45dB of ambient noise, and an Anti-Wind Noise feature. Priced at just $79.99, the Wave Pro supports high-quality LDAC audio coding and Bluetooth multipoint.\nAdditionally, the EarFun Wave Pro is equipped with a low-latency game mode and voice assistant support. One of its most impressive attributes is its extraordinary battery life, offering up to 80 hours of playtime (55 hours with ANC enabled) on a mere two-hour charge, along with the capability for wired connections. These combined qualities, particularly at such an affordable price, make the EarFun Wave Pro a standout choice for consumers.\nProtect your ears while staying connected with the 3M PELTOR WS ALERT XP Headset\nThis product isn\u2019t the most eye-catching, but it might be the most useful piece of audio tech we saw at CES 2024. The 3M PELTOR WS ALERT XP is a Bluetooth safety headset that uses light to charge its battery. On a sunny day, you can wear the 3M PELTOR WS ALERT XP without ever having to worry about running out of charge. With a noise canceling microphone and a Push-to-Listen (PTL) feature to help workers stay aware of their surroundings, this device may be a game changer in industries such as aviation or construction."

An all-new over-ear ANC wireless headphones named the Wave Pro is the company's first pair of hybrid active noise canceling over-ear wireless headphones. EarFun will also be adding a new portable wireless Bluetooth speaker to their lineup called the UBOOM X, details further below.\nThe Wave Pro will offer an outstanding hybrid active-noise cancellation performance of up to 45dB, and feature an instantaneous Anti-Wind Noise technology that quells jarring wind shears. Receiving Hi-Res Audition certification, the Wave Pro additionally features LDAC audio codec support. As a result, listeners can expect three times more data compared to standard Bluetooth transfer rates versions. This translates into a truly high-res audio experience with greater fidelity and dimensionality to be experienced with music and other media. To deliver the high-resolution experience, the Wave Pro is driven by a pair of expertly-refined 40mm DLC composite film dynamic coil speakers. Together, the powerful drivers and high-resolution certifications can achieve rich detail with a frequency response up to 40kHz, while delivering deep, immersive bass, for a versatile, dynamic sound signature.\nWhile on the go, the Wave Pro can confidently take calls with the inclusion of advanced ENC tech and a 5-Microphone AI-powered algorithm that keeps calls clear and voices easily distinguishable. With an 80-hour battery life, the Wave Pro is a true wireless workhorse. The pair of ANC wireless headphones has fast charging, with a short 10-inute charge offering a lengthy 10 hours of playback. And if you prefer a wired connection, an auxiliary port is available. When it comes to its design, the Wave Pro housing is ultra-comfortable thanks to its lightweight and sensible ergonomics. Its multipoint connection makes it easy to keep the headphones on while instantly changing between connected Bluetooth devices, or activating any of its supported voice assistants. The Wave Pro also features a dedicated Game Mode, achieving extremely low-latency (<55ms), perfect for both gaming and streaming.\n80 Watts of True Audio Portability\nThe second product to be released by EarFun during CES 2024 is the new UBOOM X. Adding to its current line-up of award-winning speakers of the same series, this newly designed speaker will pump out a whopping 80 watts of power using four drivers (two 4-inch mid-woofers and two 20mm silk dome tweeters).

An all-new over-ear ANC wireless headphones named the Wave Pro is the company's first pair of hybrid active noise canceling over-ear wireless headphones. EarFun will also be adding a new portable wireless Bluetooth speaker to their lineup called the UBOOM X, details further below.\nEarFun's First High-Res ANC Over-Ear Headphones and 80-Watt JumboBassTM Outdoor Speaker\nThe Wave Pro will offer an outstanding hybrid active-noise cancellation performance of up to 45dB, and feature an instantaneous Anti-Wind Noise technology that quells jarring wind shears. Receiving Hi-Res Audition certification, the Wave Pro additionally features LDAC audio codec support. As a result, listeners can expect three times more data compared to standard Bluetooth transfer rates versions. This translates into a truly high-res audio experience with greater fidelity and dimensionality to be experienced with music and other media. To deliver the high-resolution experience, the Wave Pro is driven by a pair of expertly-refined 40mm DLC composite film dynamic coil speakers. Together, the powerful drivers and high-resolution certifications can achieve rich detail with a frequency response up to 40kHz, while delivering deep, immersive bass, for a versatile, dynamic sound signature.\nWhile on the go, the Wave Pro can confidently take calls with the inclusion of advanced ENC tech and a 5-Microphone AI-powered algorithm that keeps calls clear and voices easily distinguishable. With an 80-hour battery life, the Wave Pro is a true wireless workhorse. The pair of ANC wireless headphones has fast charging, with a short 10-minute charge offering a lengthy 10 hours of playback. And if you prefer a wired connection, an auxiliary port is available. When it comes to its design, the Wave Pro housing is ultra-comfortable thanks to its lightweight and sensible ergonomics. Its multipoint connection makes it easy to keep the headphones on while instantly changing between connected Bluetooth devices, or activating any of its supported voice assistants. The Wave Pro also features a dedicated Game Mode, achieving extremely low-latency (<55ms), perfect for both gaming and streaming.\n80 Watts of True Audio Portability\nThe second product to be released by EarFun during CES 2024 is the new UBOOM X.

CES 2024 proper kicked off on Tuesday, January 9 and ran until Friday, January 12, 2024 (oh, we didn't want it to end! ), and over the course of the event, manufacturers from BREGGZ to Bose, EarFun to FiiO, Hidizs to Kanto, Naqi to Sonos , Sony to Victrola and myriad more showed off their latest audio tech, concept ideas, prototypes and ready-for-market products. The sonic treats unveiled will soon be vying for a spot on our best headphones , best turntables , and best wireless earbuds lists, once we can get our hands on them and put them through our fully star-rated review process. That said, we've had people on the ground in Las Vegas throughout the event, so our ears-on coverage might be all that's needed for you to decide whether a product is worth snapping up now \u2013 or as soon as its hits the shelves. We've rounded up the 23 most exciting audio tech announcements revealed at CES 2024 \u2013 so strap in and get comfortable, there's plenty here to enjoy. Speakers, turntables, streamers and, er\u2026 cassette players\nWant to improve your home theater surround-sound system or upgrade your speakers? CES 2024 is the place to find out what's hot right now; we've been treated to a veritable smorgasbord of home audio solutions. It's not Sean Bean, but if you squint it could be him\u2026\u00a0 (Image credit: LG)\nFirst up is the unique LG Labs DukeBox (above), a concept translucent OLED screen-toting valve amp jukebox with fireside visuals \u2013\u00a0yes, that's really as good a summary as we can muster. Billed as \"an innovative audio product that seamlessly combines the charm of vacuum tube audio with cutting-edge transparent OLED panel technology\", we have to admire the idea: classic sensibilities mixed with state-of-the-art technology. Formidable, but beautiful under a full moon\u2026\u00a0 (Image credit: Sonos Faber)\nElsewhere, Sonus Faber unveiled arguably the most high-ticket item at CES , the Sonus Faber Suprema speaker system, yours for a cool $750,000 (and who's to say it isn't worth every last cent?). At the other end of the food chain, JBL brought special sonic Auracast powers to its most lovable and affordable next-gen JBL Clip 5 speaker. On that note, our very own Matt Bolton attended a very special Auracast demo at CES involving faux airport lounges and the like, and he truly believes the audio broadcasting tech will change our relationship with our headphones \u2013 and with each other. We should all be going green (Image credit: Focal )\nThe Focal Aria Evo X is a five-strong lineup of Focal speakers unveiled at CES \u2013 and, frankly, we think the availability of a moss green finish option alone makes it the floorstander to beat at CES . Audio Pro's C20 is a demure but exciting new multi-room audio speaker\u00a0 (Image credit: Audio Pro)\nIf you want a speaker around which to build a multi-room wireless audio system or one to connect to a turntable, the new Audio Pro C20 could be it. I've written\u00a0 love letters to this firm's stunning speaker output , and with the slightly bigger C20, the company has broadened its already extensive connectivity options. By adding a phono stage, Audio Pro's new speaker can be plugged straight into your turntable , allowing you to simply power it on, lower that needle and get into the groove! Of course, this is Audio Pro (maker of some of the\u00a0 best wireless speakers \u00a0on the planet), so the new C20 also features AirPlay 2,\u00a0 Google \u00a0Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth, ARC and multi-room capability, too. Don't have a turntable yet? Don't you worry, we've just the thing\u2026\nVictrola Stream Sapphire \u2013\u00a0a wealth of connectivity\u00a0 (Image credit: Victrola)\nIf it's a new plate-spinner you're after, Victrola's extensive CES rollout included a slew of hot decks. Our favorite? We've narrowed it down to either the Victrola Automatic, a fully automatic turntable with a first-of-its-kind \"Repeat\" feature to continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record, or the Victrola Stream Sapphire (pictured above), the company's new best-in-class flagship wireless turntable, which now works with multiple streaming ecosystems. What makes it so good? The Victrola Stream Sapphire builds on the DNA of Victrola\u2019s inaugural October 2022 Stream deck \u2013\u00a0which you can learn about in our dedicated\u00a0 Victrola Stream Carbon review \u00a0\u2013 by expanding on its connectivity solutions, to stream vinyl in \"stunning clarity\" to UPnP and Roon-integrated systems as well as Sonos, plus support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio. The portable cassette player is back again (Image credit: Future)\nIf that\u2019s not old-school enough, feast your eyes on this ode to the original 1979 Sony Walkman , the FiiO C13. That's right, we came to CES 2024 and saw a portable cassette player. There's no Bluetooth, so forget wireless listening (this is real retro; you've got to live it), plus the only new-fangled feature is the USB-C charging port, so you won't need to keep buying batteries. It does have a rewind button, though, so there will be no flipping the tape over and fast-forwarding to go back to the start of your jam, right before the beat drops. (Image credit: Fiio )\nBack to the future (see what we did there) of audio and FiiO's been busy here, too \u2013check out the little bijou music maestro above, the FiiO R9. In a nutshell, it's the compact music system with smartphone-esque screen I need in my life , because it's so multi-faceted it's hard to know what to call it. DAC/amp streamer? Music hub? Entire just-add-speakers music streaming system? It's all of these things \u2013 and, refreshingly, it takes up about the same room in you home as a houseplant. FiiO calls it a \"flagship desktop audio player/streamer & balanced DAC/amplifier\". We call it a fantastically featured and great-looking little proposition. Soundbars\nAdding a soundbar (or upgrading the one you have) can add oodles of separation, immersion and bass clout to your home entertainment setup, and CES 2024 has delivered standard \"bar-and-sub\" propositions and quirky space-saving options in equal measure. The Samsung HW-Q990D in the home we'd all like to own (Image credit: Samsung )\nTake Samsung , which revealed its 2024 soundbar lineup at CES, headlined by the Samsung HW-Q990D (above), which is the successor to the fantastic\u00a0 Samsung HW-Q990C \u2013 one of the \u00a0best Dolby Atmos soundbars \u00a0available. It has 11.1.4 channels (the same as the Q990C), supports wireless Dolby Atmos, and now comes with\u00a04K\u00a0120Hz passthrough for games consoles, something the Q990C lacked. There\u2019s also Party Play mode, which tunes the HW-Q990D to play a balanced sound across the whole system when listening to music, so everyone has the same experience. Samsung's Music Frame \u2013\u00a0art that really speaks to us (Image credit: Samsung)\nLook, we adore\u00a0 Samsung's The Frame TV, which happily becomes an electronic art gallery \u00a0when you're not bingeing the entire series of Beef on Netflix \u2013\u00a0and as our IKEA-meets- Sonos \u00a0 Symfonisk Picture Frame with Wi-Fi Speaker review \u00a0proves, we love an audio solution boasting space-saving style and substance. Samsung tells us the Samsung HW-LS60D (aka the technical name for the Music Frame) is the world\u2019s first customizable and personalized wireless speaker with built-in IoT hub, and it's meant to \"be used as a TV speaker, rear speaker, or a subwoofer \u2013 and even pair two for more surround sound options\". Music Frame also boasts Dolby Atmos support and hides two woofers, two tweeters, and two mid-drivers behind your chosen photo (you can digitally print your favorite memories onto the accompanying \"Art Panel\"; a Diasec matte acrylic plate). From an audio perspective, we must remain cautious: the Music Frame is literally meant to hang on a wall, which\u00a0should\u00a0mean vibrations, articles, echo \u2013 all of the audio nasties. Then again, we love the space-saving, art-loving concept and this is Samsung, after all, so we'll reserve judgement until we've heard it properly. Headphones and earbuds\nCES 2024 has seen a swathe of fantastic wireless earbuds, so it might seem odd to be kicking off with a relatively humble-looking pair (by today's standards) from EarFun. But the EarFun Wave Pro aren't just the company's first ever stab at over-ear headphones; they're also LDAC and hi-res certified, offer noise cancellation and a whopping 80-hour battery life , all for $79.99. Suffice to say, we can't wait to hear them. 80 hours is an awful lot of stamina for $80, no? (Image credit: Earfun)\nScreens on earbuds' cases are definitely a thing at CES 2024 \u2013 Samsung unveiled a Galaxy Buds case with an OLED screen , but said it had no plans to actually release it, while JBL is sticking to its screen-enhanced earbuds lineup with the new JBL Live 3. They come in three different designs, but they all have one feature in common: JBL's touchscreen Smart Charging Case, which is designed to make it much easier and quicker to access your audio playback and your earbuds' various features \u2013 it's like having a smartwatch screen right on the case. Unveiled at CES: an OLED screen on a Samsung Galaxy Buds case (Image credit: CNET)\nWe first saw JBL's screen-enhanced case in the JBL Tour Pro 2, and were fans initially: in our \u00a0JBL Tour Pro 2 review we said that the case was \"a thing of beauty\". However, the novelty kind of wore off, over time, in favor of our trusty phone and JBL's excellent companion app. There are three options in the JBL Live 3 range: Buds, Beam and Flex . As with their current incarnations, the Buds 3 look most like standard earbuds; the Beam 3 are like\u00a0 Apple 's AirPods Pro, sporting a stick design and an in-ear fit; the Flex 3 are like regular AirPods, with a stick design but no silicone tip that sits right in the ear canal. All three have JBL's True Adaptive Noise Cancelling and\u00a0 Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio . The JBL Tune Flex earbuds (Image credit: JBL)\nThe next big thing in portable listening gear at CES 2024? Neural headphones . If the idea of your headphones being able to read your mind doesn't sit easy with you, calm yourself with the thought that products such as the CES Innovation Award honoree Naqi Neural Earbuds and NeurGear ZenBud are designed not to neurohack your noggin and control your actions, but to help you out \u2013\u00a0either by giving you full, hands-free control over your Windows or Mac computer, including typing, browsing, online shopping and gaming (Naqi); or by stimulating your Vagus nerve using ultrasonic sound waves to relax you (NeurGear). We've been covering similar tech since June of last year, with the Neurable headphones . It seems the idea really is here to stay, and if it could potentially act as a safe and non-invasive alternative to brain implants, we're all for it. Naqi's Neural Earbuds are billed as a safe, non-invasive alternative to brain implants (Image credit: Future)\nElsewhere, BREGGZ has unveiled a new \"hearable\": made-to-measure earbuds that both promise a custom fit better than even hand-made molds . They're are also being touted as \"the world\u2019s first truly wireless, custom-made in-ear computer\". In a resoundingly positive nod to sustainability, BREGGZ's IEMs also utilize a unique, patented \"one-box\" technology, where all of the hardware and firmware is processed in a mini cartridge, which can be easily replaced if (or when) the user wants to upgrade to a newer version, or following a battery charge decrease over time. A thing of beauty and a nod to sustainability (Image credit: BREGGZ)\nBut what of the heavy-hitters? Sennheiser has unveiled the new Momentum True Wireless 4 along with the Accentum Plus, and Momentum Sport for every kind of listener \u2013\u00a0but the headline grabber is the Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds , billed as \"Sennheiser's most capable earbud yet\". They're built around the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform \u2013 which is also going to be a really big deal in 2024 \u2013 and Snapdragon Sound, which means aptX lossless sound quality, as well as exceptionally low latency. The Bluetooth version is 5.4 with confirmed support for\u00a0 Auracast , improved ANC, something Sennheiser calls \"evolved tuning\", and upgraded batteries to boot. Lovely looking little Sennheiser earbuds\u00a0 (Image credit: Sennheiser)\nAlso landing were the Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7 wireless earbuds \u2013 chic, hi-res Audio-Technica earbuds with LDAC streaming for less \u2013 and, in the wired realm, the Hidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs, which not only boast hi-res audio support but also a DAC built into the USB-C connector. It's a simple audiophile-friendly solution that means levelling up your wired audio with a separate DAC dongle to get the goods will no longer be necessary \u2013 making the ST2 Pro almost certainly a serious audio upgrade for your iPhone 15 , Android phone, Mac or PC. Can you see where the DAC is? (Image credit: Hidizs)\nHi-Fi acessories\nTechRadar's Josephine Watson (Managing Editor, Lifestyle) tried Nanoleaf's new music-syncing software at CES , and discovered that house parties will never be the same. Nanoleaf announced a spring 2024 release along with\u00a0 news of its new outdoor lights \u00a0(which she also saw at CES, and they're\u00a0gorgeous), describing the software as \u00a0a \u201creal-time audio-visual experience\u201d. Nanoleaf Orchestrator is a new desktop-based music interpretation engine that actually analyzes your music itself, to create a comprehensive light show with your devices. Not only can Orchestrator create a palette of colors based on your chosen song's vibe or mood, it also lets you customize which lights respond to which musical passages or frequencies of a song. Want your bulbs to pulse along with the bassline while your smart light panels react to the mids or highs? Done. Great-looking Merc; great-sounding Burmester system (Image credit: Dolby)\nWant to take your music out of your home and on the road? TechRadar's Senior Editor of Home Entertainment, Al Griffin , has you covered. He got to experience a Mercedes-Benz S 580 tricked out with a 4D sound system furnished by German manufacturer Burmester at CES. The 31-speaker Burmester 4D configuration is an option for the latest MBUX-generation infotainment system in Mercedes-Benz vehicles, and it allows for Atmos-compatible tracks to be streamed in an immersive format from\u00a0 Apple \u00a0Music and\u00a0 Amazon \u00a0Music.

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.
