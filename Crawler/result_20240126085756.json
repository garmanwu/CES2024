        "raw_content": "Narwal's Freo X Ultra Cleaned Up The Competition At CES 2024\nEach year, the Consumer Electronics Show, or CES, introduces products and devices to the consumers who will benefit from their use the most. New technologies abound, many of which make living in our homes easier, particularly when it comes to cleaning. With the help of these valuable new pieces of technology, much of the grunt work and hassle of keeping a clean home are eliminated or eased considerably, at least. One such amazing new piece of technology comes in the form of the\u00a0Narwal Freo X Ultra, a robot vacuum that pulls the rug (figuratively) out from under similar vacs. With solutions to many of the criticisms that hinder other devices \u2014 including freedom from hair tangling and the ability to store dust longer without requiring a cleaning cycle \u2014 the Narwal Freo X Ultra cleaned up the competition, earning itself the House Digest CES Innovation Award 2024.\nNarwal, a robotics company, has been at the forefront of the more luxurious robotic vacuum market, which varies in price and features. But even the most expensive models often struggle with issues of hair tangling, excessive noise, and energy use. The new Narwal model solves all those problems neatly and looks to be a continuing frontrunner in robot vacuum technology.\nNew solutions\nAccording to a press release from Narwal, Junbin Zhang, founder and CEO of Narwal Robotics, said, \"Narwal introduced these innovative features with a clear goal: addressing users' real pain points in home cleaning. Previous station-based vacuums posed problems with residual dirt, noise, and hair tangling. To solve this, we created a hands-free Self-Contained Dust Processing System, enabling the robot to internally handle garbage collection, resulting in zero residue and a remarkable 36% reduction in noise.\"\nThe Narwal Freo X Ultra sports a cleaning mechanism that rotates at 60,000 RPM, while offering both vacuuming and mopping functionalities. The AI DirtSense technology allows it to go where needed and assess progress on touchier cleaning jobs. The floating brush allows the collection of dirt and debris while avoiding the common problem of materials like hair and threads getting tangled in the brush. This is particularly important in homes with pets because shedding can often impact the functionality of other vacuums, as fur often gets clogged and tangled.\nLess hassle\nThe Narwal Freo X Ultra also has the ability to store dust in the vacuum for up to 60 days, which makes the self-cleaning process in the docking station work better and less frequently, eliminating noise and using less energy. The vacuum boasts communication abilities with platforms like Alexa and Siri, making it easy to use and deploy. The triangular motion mopping gives a more thorough cleaning than other robot vacuums.\nWhile Narwal's Freo X Ultra has a price tag as luxurious as its new functions at $1,499.00, the less expensive Freo Plus X has all the new features of the Ultra minus the self-cleaning docking station for only $469. On the higher end of luxe robot vacuums\u00a0compared to other manufacturers, the Narwal Freo X Ultra is sure to be a frontrunner by eliminating many of the problems of other machines while maintaining the high-speed cleaning and convenient interfaces that consumers have come to expect."

        "raw_content": "Narwal\u2019s \u2018hairodynamic\u2019 robot mops debut at CES 2024\nNarwal \u2014 a brand known for crafting popular robot mops \u2014 took the stage during CES 2024 to debut the Narwal Freo X Ultra and Narwal Freo X Plus. Billed as the \u201csmartest, most powerful, and quietest vacuum mops in the world,\u201d Narwal is hoping they make a splash in the world of smart home automation. (It appears to have the specs to back up the claims.)\nThe Narwal Freo X Ultra is the most compelling of the duo, boasting an impressive 8,200 Pa of suction. That puts it near the top of the pack, competing with products like the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra (6,000 Pa) and the Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni (8,000 Pa). And because it can compress the dust into its onboard dustbin, you\u2019ll only need to empty it every 60 days.\nIt\u2019s a similar story for the Narwal Freo X Plus, though it maxes out at 7,800 Pa of suction.\nAnother big draw of the two robots is the so-called \u201chairodynamics\u201d system, which incorporates a floating brush into its design to capture more hair without getting tangled than other robot vacuums and mops. It also benefits from an enlarged outlet that can easily suck up hair without impacting its floating brush, and airflow that helps push would-be tangles down into the dustbin.\nToss in DirtSense technology to identify key locations that need additional attention, scrubbing mops that apply 12 newtons of force while rotating, and a useful EdgeSwing mode for improved mopping coverage, and it\u2019s clear Narwal is positioning these devices to be premium options.\nIf you prefer to clean your floors manually, Narwal also introduced the Narwal S10 Pro during CES. This upright mop uses 32 water streams to produce 17 newtons of pressure to tackle tricky stains and spills. Its handle can also rotate up to 180 degrees, so you can easily slip it under chairs or other obstacles. Best of all, it automatically scrubs and cleans its roller brushes when hooked up to its charging station to prevent the buildup of mildew and odors.\nBoth the Narwal Freo X Ultra and Plus will be available in March, clocking in at $1,099 and $499, respectively. You\u2019ll also be able to pick up a Water Exchange System for an extra $299 that\u2019ll handle all the water refilling and draining associated with mopping. The S10 Pro launches in April with a price tag of $400.\nSamsung first revealed Ballie -- its rolling smart home hub -- at CES 2020. Now, at CES 2024, the adorable robot is making a triumphant return, this time sporting a new built-in projector. Samsung didn't have a physical Ballie roving around at CES, but the team showed off a home bot demonstration video, revealing how the robot has evolved over the years.\nIf you're unfamiliar with Ballie, think of it as a roving smart home hub, capable of taking orders from you and syncing with the rest of your smart home. Along with dishing out commands to your connected gadgets, it can serve as a patrolling security guard, giving you a live stream of your home while at work or on vacation.\nKohler showed off a bevy of new products at CES 2024, including a luxurious lineup of new smart home gadgets, all of which are designed to transform your bathroom into a \"personal sanctuary.\" Along with updates to the Numi 2.0 smart toilet and high-end Stillness Bath, Kohler showed off a new fan, sink, and bidet, as well as smart valves and more.\nThe Anthem+ Digital Control was one of the most intriguing items at the Kohler booth, as can power nearly all aspects of your bathroom from a single control panel. Via its touch display, it allows you to control water, light, sound, and steam. All told, it can connect to 12 water outlets to power a variety of sprayers, showerheads, and body sprays.\nSegway -- the company responsible for Paul Blart's preferred mode of transportation -- already has a surprisingly robust smart home lineup. The company expanded its catalog at CES 2024, revealing a new series of robot lawn mowers (Navimow i Series) and a new portable power station (Segway Cube Series).\nThe upcoming Navimow i Series makes a few big improvements over Segway's existing H Series. Along with the ability to work without wires (which are typically used to set boundaries for the robot), the i Series employs a technology known as the Exact Fusion Locating System (EFLS). Segway says this will let the robot lawn mower better track its location and ensure it's cutting your lawn as close to specifications as possible.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

        "raw_content": "WWE 2K24 Cover Athletes Revealed, Launches On March\u2026\nJanuary 22, 2024\nThe Last of Us Part II Remastered Review\u2026\nJanuary 16, 2024\nAn Interview With The Developers of Contra: Operation\u2026\nJanuary 9, 2024\nTEKKEN 8 Story Trailer Released, Demo Out Now\nDecember 14, 2023\nNarwal Makes A Huge Debut At CES\nNarwal, a pioneer in home robotics announced 3 new products today.\nNew in their lineup is Narwal Freo X Ultra and Narwal Freo X Plus, the smartest, most powerful, and quietest vacuum mops in the world, as well as the versatile upright Narwal S10 Pro.\nNew technologies included are a tangle free brush, the ability to compress dust for 60 days, and AI DirtSenseTM technology that maps problem-cleaning areas.\nSuction That Doesn\u2019t Suck\nThe innovative air duct design and mighty motor of the Narwal Freo X Ultra and Narwal Freo X Plus combine to make them the most powerful robotic vacuums on the market. The fan rotational speedsreach up to 60,000 RPM (more than double the industry average: 24,000 RPM), and the unique U-shaped air duct streamlines airflow to produce an incredible 8,200 PA (X Ultra) and 7,800 PA (X Plus) of strong suction.\nThe U-shaped air duct in an industry first. Unlike conventional curved ducts that suffer from debris collection around the inlet, the U-shape design and use of aviation-grade aluminum-magnesium alloys allow for uninterrupted, high-speed airflow to be maintained within the robot. It also facilitates another industry first, the ability to store and compress dust within the robot itself.\nReinventing Self-Empty\nAn innovative feature of Narwal Freo X Ultra and Plus is the fact they store and compact dust within the robot itself rather than the base station. Dust is held inside the device in a convenient dustbag that is easy to remove for disposal. The suction power and dust compression technology packs the dust into tight parcels, which means there is no need to empty for up to 60 days. To reduce health risks from bacterial growth, the dust bag is air-dried within the base station to accelerate moisture evaporation.\nTackling Tangles with \u201cHairodynamics\u201d\nOne of the most frustrating challenges in traditional vacuuming is dealing with tangled hair. Narwal addresses this issue with the world\u2019s first Zero-Tangling Floating Brush. Certified to capture 95.6% of hair with 0% tangling by internationally renowned validation companies, its brush is aerodynamically engineered and positioned to create airflows that prevent tangles. Tilted at 50 degrees, the cone-shaped rubber strips have unequal sizes, directing air to the sides to prevent hair from tangling in the middle of the brush.\u00a0 The spinning of the fins also ensures hair strands of any length get \u201cswiped left,\u201d where they are then sucked into the dustbag through an enlarged outlet.\u00a0You can see it in action here.\nDirtSenseTM Technology for Marvelous Mopping\nLeveraging AI and optical technology, Narwal DirtSense technology assesses the cleanliness of the water used during mopping to detect dirty floor areas. Once detected, the robot returns to problem areas and re-mops until sparklingly clean. To ensure marvelous mopping, the device automatically washes the mop head, applies cleaning solution at optimal ratios, and humidity sensors even adjust the mop\u2019s dampness to maximize results.\nThe Reuleaux Triangular Scrubbing Mops of the Narwal Freo X Ultra and Plus apply 12N of downward pressure and rotate at 180 RPM for exceptional scrubbing power.\u00a0 To ensure no spot is missed, Narwal has EdgeSwingTM mode, a motion that automatically rotates the robot back and forth. While it may look like it\u2019s doing \u201cThe Twist,\u201d it allows it to reach around and into corners and crevices.\u00a0 Full tech specs of Narwal Freo X Ultra and Plus can be viewed here.\nUnder Control\nThe robots navigate using tri-laser obstacle avoidance with LiDAR SLAM 4.0 Integration. People are in control with the intuitive Narwal app or can provide commands with Alexa, Google, or Siri voice assistance. In another first, the Narwal Freo X Ultra can be controlled via a base station touchscreen.\nEmpowering Lifestyle Choices: Catering to Users\u2019 Preferences\nNarwal Freo X Ultra Offering tailored choices, Narwal\u2019s latest innovations, the Freo X Ultra and Freo X Plus cater to distinct preferences. The flagship X Ultra provides a comprehensive cleaning experience with its self-cleaning base station, including DirtSense\u2122 and drying capabilities. In contrast, the budget-friendly X Plus retains exceptional vacuuming and mopping functionalities but skips the self-cleaning base station. The key difference lies in this exclusive feature, empowering users to select between premium, all-encompassing cleaning or a streamlined, cost-effective alternative based on their specific needs.\nNarwal S10 Pro\nNarwal Floor Washer Seen in action here, The Narwal S10 Pro also debuts at CES. It is an elegant handheld wet-dry vacuum packed full of technology and indigenous design features to ensure homes have flawless floors.\u00a0 Within the sleek device is a powerful, efficient mop served by 32 running water streams that produce 17N mopping pressure and 76AW suction efficiency.\nLight and nimble, its handle rotates 1800 from vertical to horizontal to get under chairs, tables, and obstacles, and its edge-to-edge mop gets to the nitty gritty of every room, even curved walls!\u00a0 Making short shrift of even the dirtiest of floors, it has a 99.99% disinfection rate and automatically separates solid and liquid waste for easy disposal. Once cleaning is complete, it automatically scrubs, cleans, dries, and disinfects the roller brush, pipes, and filters within its charging station.\u00a0 Always ready for life\u2019s spills, its full tech specs can be seen here.\nAvailability\nThe Freo X Ultra will be available for purchase at $1,499 in March, the Freo X Plus will be available for purchase at $469 in March. The S10 Pro will be priced at $449 in April.\u00a0 An Auto Water Exchange System is also available on the website, priced at $299.

These new cleaning solutions hope to bring flawless floors to homes.\nThe new flagship Narwal Freo X Ultra is a robotic vacuum and mop with a tangle-free floating brush that can store dust for up to 60 days. The onboard computer has AI DirtSense technology that can identify problem-cleaning areas on the home map.\nThe Narwal Freo X Plus has many of the same features as the X Ultra, just without a self-cleaning base station. Both models hold and compact dust within the robot for 60 days, removing the need for storage within the base station.\nNarwal's new robots have 60,000 RPM fan rotational speed and 8,200 PA suction for X Ultra and 7,800 PA for X Plus. The Zero-Tangling Floating Brush can capture 99.56% of hair with zero tangling.\nNot to be left out of the artificial intelligence race, Narwal AI DirtSense can assess the cleanliness of water used during mopping to detect dirty floor areas. The robot returns to trouble areas until DirtSense sees the water improve.\nThe robots navigate via LiDAR SLAM 4.0. Voice assistants like Siri are also supported for giving direct commands.\nThe Narwal S10 Pro is a handheld wet-dry vacuum with 32 running water streams that produce 17N mopping pressure and 76AW suction efficiency. The light and nimble vacuum is easy to maneuver with a 180-degree rotation.\nThe Freo X Ultra costs $1,399, and the Freo X Plus costs $469, with both arriving in March. The S10 Pro is $449 and launches in April.\nAppleInsider is at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show this week until January 12, with our reporters seeing the latest HomeKit devices, Apple accessories, 8K monitors, massive televisions, and more in-person throughout the event.

        "raw_content": "News\nFinance\nSports\nEntertainment\nLife\n3 Narwal innovations are unveiled at CES 2024 that are said to be the world's 'most powerful'\nYou may have heard of Narwal before. They are considered to be amongst some of the best robot vacuums and, as of January 7, 2024, have announced the launch of three new devices to their portfolio of smart home cleaning solutions.\nThey chose a good time to share the news; it was during CES Unveiled at, you got it: CES 2024.\nNarwal is one of the top five robotic cleaning manufacturers in the world with over $200 million in annual sales and serving over 1.5 million households. They launched the Narwal Freo at a similar time last year, and ever since then, we have only been following them to see what's next for the brand.\nThey've unveiled the Narwal Freo X Ultra and Narwal Freo X Plus, claiming them to be 'the smartest, most powerful, and quietest vacuum mops in the world', as well as the versatile upright Narwal S10 Pro at the Consumer Electronics Show. They're not yet available to buy, but you can read on to find out more about them.\nNarwal Freo X Ultra\nThis is the brand's flagship product. The robot vacuum shares very similar specs to the Narwal Freo X Plus but comes with the added addition of a self-cleaning base station, two patented triangular mops, DirtSense Technology, and a leading 8200Pa suction power.\nThe all-in-one base station will remove 98% of mop build-up and warm to 40C/104F to dry the mops when clean. It'll also auto-dispense and hold debris for up to seven weeks.\nCompared to the Freo X Plus, which doesn't have the triangular mops but a pad instead, the Freo X Ultra will spin and scrub the floor by applying a force to the ground with a spin speed rate of 180RPM. This will make it ideal for hairy homes with pets that we know only too well will scatter their muddy paws where we don't want them across hard flooring.\nThen, there is what the brand refers to as the 'world's first' DirectSense technology. We've seen Shark introduce CleanSense IQ, which works similarly, but only on their Stratos range of cordless vacuum cleaners. It'll sense dirt in real time and won't stop cleaning until all the dirt is gone.\nIt comes at a cost, though. It'll be launched in March 2024 on Amazon and Narwal for a list price of $1,399. At the time of launch, it'll be $1,099. If you can do without the self-cleaning station, two scrubbing mops, and a slighter lesser spec, then you can save yourself up to $930 by opting for the Narwal X Plus.\nNarwal X Plus\nThe specs of the Narwal X Plus and of the robovac that comes with the Freo X Ultra are marginally aligned to offer an unrivaled clean on carpets and hard flooring.\nThe removable mop pad offers streak-free mopping with a 6N mopping pressure and four water outlets while, if it's carpet that you're vacuum cleaning, the floating brush will ensure 0% hair-tangling. This is all in the design. The conical shape releases the suction pathway; the single-arm brush structure allows hair to be sucked in directly; and the 50-degree bristles synergize with the suction direction.\nThe key spec also includes the tri-laser obstacle avoidance. The forward and side sensors recognize mm-level hazards, which should mean no more bumping into furniture, running over kids' toys, or falling down the stairs.\nThey can both be controlled by voice with connectivity compatibility with Amazon Alexa, Google Home, and Siri. You can also expect to achieve a runtime of 210 minutes.\nWe're in the process of reviewing the Narwal Freo, which was announced at the beginning of 2023, so it'll be interesting to see how these two new releases compare.\nNarwal S10 Pro\nVenturing beyond the robomop is the unveiling of the Narwal S10 Pro. This is a wet and dry vacuum cleaner. It could be a good alternative for you if you prefer to be fully in control of the floor cleaning and prefer to use an upright stick over a robot.\nIt has a handheld weight of 0.9kg, making it a super-lightweight option. It can also reach under low-lying furniture thanks to its ergonomic design while deploying 76AW suction efficiency with 17N mopping pressure.\nAs with the Narwal Freo X Ultra, it'll self-clean itself and remove 99.99% of bacteria. You can also expect to achieve a runtime of 50 minutes, which, although it isn't as long as most cordless vacuum cleaners (60 minutes), we do appreciate that the S10 Pro can vacuum and mop.\nIt'll launch a month later than the robomops in April 2024 with a recommended list price of $449 and be available to buy from Amazon."

Additionally, the versatile Narwal S10 Pro handheld wet dry vacuum makes its debut at the CES.\n\"Narwal introduced these innovative features with a clear goal: addressing users' real pain points in home cleaning. Previous station-based vacuums posed problems with residual dirt, noise, and hair tangling. To solve this, we created a hands-free Self-Contained Dust Processing System, enabling the robot to internally handle garbage collection, resulting in zero residue and a remarkable 36% reduction in noise.\" Says Junbin Zhang, founder and CEO of Narwal Robotics. \"Additionally, we innovatively designed a zero-tangling brush, leveraging the U Pipe High-Efficiency Air Flow System to directly suck hair from the brush into the dust bag, providing storage for up to 7 weeks, ensuring users are worry-free from cleaning.\"\nFreo X Series: Exceptional Power, Minimal Maintenance\nNarwal introduces two groundbreaking robot vacuum & mops, the Freo X Ultra and Freo X Plus, featuring\u00a0a Self-Contained Dust Processing System, world-first zero-tangling floating brush, AI DirtSense\u2122 technology, and millimeter-level tri-laser obstacle avoidance.\nWith fan rotational speeds reaching 60,000 RPM, the U-shaped air duct design delivers unparalleled suction power of 8,200 PA (X Ultra) and 7,800 PA (X Plus), making them the most powerful robotic vacuums available.\nThe Freo X Ultra and Plus store and compact dust within the robot, eliminating the need for frequent emptying. Dust is held in a convenient dust bag, allowing for dust storage up to 7 weeks without disposal. The system is installed within the robot so that it eliminates pipe clogging and jet-engine level noise that plague previous station-based dust emptying solutions.\nAddressing the issue of tangled hair, Narwal introduces the Zero-Tangling Floating Brush, preventing hair from tangling and ensuring efficient cleaning.

These solutions ensure free users from cleaning worries.\"\nFreo X Series: Exceptional Power, Minimal Maintenance\nNarwal introduces two groundbreaking robot vacuum & mops, the Freo X Ultra and Freo X Plus, featuring\u00a0a Self-Contained Dust Processing System, world-first zero-tangling floating brush, AI DirtSense\u2122 technology, and millimeter-level tri-laser obstacle avoidance.\nWith fan rotational speeds reaching 60,000 RPM, the U-shaped air duct design delivers unparalleled suction power of 8,200 PA (X Ultra) and 7,800 PA (X Plus), making them the most powerful robotic vacuums available.\nThe Freo X Ultra and Plus store and compact dust within the robot, eliminating the need for frequent emptying. Dust is held in a convenient dust bag, allowing for dust storage up to 7 weeks without disposal. The system is installed within the robot so that it eliminates pipe clogging and jet-engine level noise that plague previous station-based dust emptying solutions.\nAddressing the issue of tangled hair, Narwal introduces the Zero-Tangling Floating Brush, preventing hair from tangling and ensuring efficient cleaning. Certified to capture 95.6% of hair with 0% tangling by internationally renowned testing institutes\u00a0SGS and TUV Rheinland.\nLeveraging AI and optical technology, DirtSense\u2122 detects dirty floor areas during mopping, ensuring thorough cleaning. Reuleaux Triangular Scrubbing Mops provide exceptional scrubbing power, and EdgeSwing\u2122 mode reaches corners effectively.\nTri-laser milimeter-level object avoidance, LiDAR SLAM 4.0 Integration, and app control provide users with seamless navigation and operation. Freo X Ultra introduces base station touchscreen control as a first in the industry.\nCatering to user preferences, Narwal offers the comprehensive X Ultra with a self-cleaning base station and the budget-friendly X Plus, retaining exceptional functionalities without the self-cleaning feature.\nNarwal S10 Pro: Slim, Swift, Stylish\nNarwal S10 Pro boasts unparalleled ease of use, seamlessly integrating advanced features for a user-friendly and effortless cleaning experience.\nDebuting at CES, the Narwal S10 Pro transforms handheld wet-dry vacuums.

        "raw_content": "Narwal Freo X Ultra, X Plus and S10 Pro Debuted at CES 2024\nBy Ricky Harewood\nNarwal, a brand known for creating popular robot mops, introduced the Narwal Freo X Ultra and Freo X Plus at CES 2024. Described as \u201cthe world\u2019s smartest, most powerful and quietest vacuum cleaner,\u201d Narwal is hoping to make it big in the world of smart home automation. (There appear to be specifications to back up the claim.)\nThree New Products For Ultra-Powerful Floor Cleaning\nThe Narwal Freo X Ultra is the most powerful of the duo, equipped an impressive 8,200Pa suction power. This puts it near the top of the pack, competing with the likes of the Roborock S8 Pro Ultra (6,000Pa) and Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni (8,000Pa). And since you can compact the dust into a built-in dustbin, all you have to do is empty it every 60 days.\nThe Narwal Freo X Plus has a suction power of up to 7,800Pa, but it's a similar story.\nAnother big advantage of both robots is their so-called \u201chairodynamics\u201d system, which incorporates floating brushes into the design to capture more hair without tangling than other robot vacuums and mops. You also benefit from an extended outlet that can easily suck up hair without affecting the floating brush, as well as airflow to help push tangled hair into the bin.\nWith the introduction of DirtSense technology to identify key locations that need extra attention, a mopping mop that applies 12 newtons of force while spinning, and a useful EdgeSwing mode for improved mopping range, it's clear that Narwal is positioning these devices as a premium option.\nIf you want to clean your floors manually, Narwal also launched the Narwal S10 Pro at CES. This upright mop uses 32 streams of water to produce 17 newtons of pressure to tackle tough stains and spills. The handle can rotate up to 180 degrees, making it easy to slide under chairs or other obstacles. Best of all, when connected to a charging station, the roller brushes automatically scrub and clean to prevent mold and odor build-up.\nPrice and availability\nBoth the Narwal Freo X Ultra and Plus will be available in March priced at $1,099 and $499, respectively. You will also be able to purchase a water exchange system for an additional $299 that will take care of all the water filling and draining associated with mopping. The S10 Pro will be released in April and will cost $400.\nOR\nSign up to SMARTHOME\nnews\nComments\nPlease login to comment\nSign in to SMARTHOME news\nOR\nSign up to SMARTHOME news\nComments on this Product\nPlease login to comment\nAbout us\nWe are part of the Amazon associates program.
