The move is expected to relieve the range anxiety among NEV owners.(Xinhua/Mao Siqian)\nSHENZHEN, Jan. 17 (Xinhua) -- As the clock struck 4 p.m., Zhong Yu concluded a meeting in Shenzhen's Futian District and left for his office driving his sleek AVATR 11, a new energy vehicle (NEV) model.\nEn route, he made a pit stop at the Shenzhen Convention and Exhibition Center's supercharging station to quickly recharge his car. Zhong shared that he often drives his NEV for work and on occasions when he overlooks charging it at home, the convenience of a supercharging station becomes a lifesaver.\nThe liquid-cooling supercharging station was built by China Southern Power Grid with technology support from Huawei. Its 600-kilowatt charger can charge Zhong's AVATR 11, with 200 km mileage, in just 10 minutes.\nThis city in south China's Guangdong Province started building advanced NEV charging facilities in June 2023 to become \"a city of supercharging,\" and has set up 161 supercharging stations by the end of the year. The move is expected to relieve the range anxiety among NEV owners.\nSupercharging is an advanced charging technology designed to surpass even the pace of fast charging. Boasting a remarkable maximum output power of 600 kilowatts and a maximum output current of 600 amps, this system can charge NEVs at a speed of up to one kilometer per second.\nIn October 2023, Shenzhen's development and reform commission rolled out an action plan to build NEV supercharging stations from 2023 to 2025. Accordingly, the city will have built at least 300 such stations by the end of March 2024.\nShenzhen's ambition was backed by its industrial chain. In terms of the charger manufacturing industry, Shenzhen is home to many enterprises specializing in charging module manufacturing and charger operation, such as Huawei, Winline and Infypower.\nChargers produced in Shenzhen account for more than 50 percent of the national market while charging modules manufactured in the city surpass 70 percent market share.\nBesides the supercharging facilities, the NEV and power battery industries are also playing important roles in Shenzhen's effort to become \"a city of supercharging.\"\nAs of the first half of 2023, the number of NEVs in Shenzhen reached 860,000, and the penetration rate of NEVs in the new car market exceeded 60 percent. Many new vehicle models launched in the market in recent years are equipped with supercharging technology.\nBYD, headquartered in Shenzhen and one of China's largest NEV manufacturers, has so far manufactured about 6 million NEVs.\nIt is estimated that by the end of 2025, the number of NEVs in the city will reach 1.3 million, and the NEV penetration rate in the new car market will hit 70 percent.\nShenzhen has some 24,000 new energy and digital energy enterprises as part of the supercharging industrial chain. Sunwoda Energy, headquartered in Baoan District, is one of China's major power battery and consumer battery makers.\nIn April 2023, the company released a new type of supercharging power battery which can power the NEV to run 1,000 km, and can be recharged from 20 percent to 80 percent in just 10 minutes. The battery has already been supplied to NEV makers.\nIn June 2023, the State Council issued a guideline to further boost the building of a high-quality charging infrastructure network in order to meet the rapid development of the country's NEVs.\nMany provinces and cities have unveiled plans to beef up their supercharging infrastructure, including Hainan, Chongqing and Shandong, as well as Shenzhen's neighboring city Guangzhou.\nAccording to deputy secretary-general of China Electricity Council Liu Yongdong, the industrial chain is ready to produce core components of high-voltage NEVs. An increasing number of new car models equipped with supercharging technology will enter the market from the end of 2023.\nThe sector also has started commercializing the supercharging power battery and industrializing the charging facilities with output power as high as 1,000 kilowatts, Liu said. \u25a0\nA driver uses a 600-kilowatt charger to recharge his new energy vehicle (NEV) at the supercharging station of the Shenzhen Convention and Exhibition Center in Shenzhen, south China's Guangdong Province, Nov. 28, 2023.\nShenzhen City started building advanced new energy vehicle (NEV) charging facilities in June 2023 to become \"a city of supercharging,\" and has set up 161 supercharging stations by the end of the year. The move is expected to relieve the range anxiety among NEV owners.\n(Xinhua/Mao Siqian)"

We are famaily, we are all living on earth!\nOur passion for helping people to store energy, save money while also preserving the environment drives us to develop and sale emerging products.\nOne way we can achieve this is through helping people build their own Off Grid Battery banks with LiFePO4 Batteries and accessories.\nOur Story\nMarvel has Iron Man. Tesla has Elon Musk. We have Jacky Lin.\nUnlike most of us, we have been obsessed with electricity since childhood. He studied batteries until he graduated from university and finally became a battery engineer As an engineer, he\u2019s racked up over 20 years of experience developing groundbreaking ionic lithium battery technology, collecting a plethora of patents related to lithium battery management systems along the way. It\u2019s how he fell in love with power (in a good way). But there were things he didn\u2019t love. Like all the unanswered questions...\nWhy are lithium batteries so expensive? The numbers didn\u2019t add up.\nWhy don\u2019t they add the ability to check your battery status from your phone? We have the technology, after all.\nWhy do people still buy lead acid batteries?\nLithium was (and is) superior in every way, including cost, especially long term. So he set out to answer those questions (using first principles thinking, of course). A thorough believer in \u201cactions speak louder than words,\u201d he created Tewaycell battery brand. Thanks to his vision, the company is now helping the world revolutionize energy storage, develop planet-safe power, and play harder and longer. Because better batteries mean better, bigger, and longer adventures. Founded in 2007, Tewaycell has become a worldwide leader in the field of LiFePO4 batteries, because of a clear vision and top shelf products that won\u2019t wring your wallet dry.\nInnovation You Can Trust\nTewaycell batteries are built tough, from materials you can count on. But great quality is just the beginning. We\u2019re constantly chasing after innovative ways to make our batteries safer, smarter, and more efficient.\nAs the creator of the Ionic brand of lithium batteries, we\u2019re proud to be on the cutting edge of technology. Ionic lithium batteries are lighter, safer, and longer lasting than traditional batteries (as well as other deep cycle lithium batteries on the market). Our other brands mirror that quality, thanks to the team\u2019s rigid standards.\nWe\u2019ve also added incredible features like Bluetooth technology. With the help of a handy app, you can check on your battery\u2019s vitals any time. No more worrying about how much power is left, or how much longer your battery will take to charge.\nOur Products\nLike a sturdy bass boat or RV, our products are built to take you where you want to go, and stay with you for the long haul. Speaking of boats and RVs, we specialize in batteries that not only power them, but enhance their performance. Our LiFePO4 lithium batteries revamp scooters, solar setups, boats, RVs, commercial applications, and more.\nWe\u2019ve also expanded our offerings to include problem-solving products like the Emergency Start. This permanently-mounted jumpstarter is the first of its kind. It can jump dead batteries in cars, trucks, SUVs, boats, UTVs, and more.\nOf course, each adventure-seeker\u2019s needs vary. That\u2019s why we\u2019re constantly adding new products to enhance your journey, wherever it may take you. Under \u201cAccessories'', you can find portable solar setups, hunting/fishing clothing, and battery extras, such as terminal adaptors and battery trays.\nGet in touch\nGet in touch\n1001, 2500106 Junxin Rd\nGuanlan St, ShenZhen\nGuangdong, China 518110\nservice@tewaycell.com\n+86 15826820826(WhatsApp)\nSupport\nSupport\nCompany\nCompany\nNewsletter Signup\nNewsletter Signup\nSubscribe to our newsletter and get 5% off your first purchase!\nAdd element"
