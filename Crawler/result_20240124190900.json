What we're talking about-- intelligent tires. We've got Rich Kramer here, the CEO and President of Goodyear, in front of this great display here. I mean, you've got so many tires here. But let's talk about Goodyear sight. This is something that you introduced a few years ago.\nRICH KRAMER: Correct.\nAKIKO FUJITA: Intelligent tires. How does it work?\nRICH KRAMER: So-- excuse me. And by the way, thanks for having us. And it's great to be here. Great to have you at our booth here today. So, intelligent tires are really about taking all the information that we can get out of that tire, and bring it into the vehicle driving systems. And the way we think about it is we look at how mobility is changing today.\nWe're really moving from what's been sort of a hardware-centric vehicle to a software-based vehicle, where we have essentially a software-centric vehicle that's, really, an electric device on wheels that gets you to a software-defined vehicle, where functions and all the features are essentially coming from a software-based solution. We're taking that same thing and creating a software-defined tire, if you will.\nAnd what we do by getting the tire characteristics and the road characteristics, using some proprietary data we have around the tires, using sensors, and using sensors to take road conditions, we're able to amalgamate that information and measure both tire-- excuse me, the temperature and pressure of a tire, but also wear and load, and ultimately, friction, or in other words, what's happening at the base of the road and the tire, taking all that information and bringing it back to vehicle driving systems to improve the safety and performance of those vehicles. Essentially, make them safer and have them perform better on whatever use case they're in.\nAKIKO FUJITA: So we're talking about communication between the tire itself, the system in there and the car.\nRICH KRAMER: Exactly.\nAKIKO FUJITA: When you talk about safety, specifically, what are we talking about? Is it about the tire pressure that you mentioned, is it about letting the vehicle know about the road conditions so they know to stop earlier?\nRICH KRAMER: Well, exactly. And maybe one of the best demonstrations of that is one of the things we announced was work that we're doing with TNO into their ABS brake systems. And what we've demonstrated in there, by providing that tire intelligence into those ABS braking systems, we can actually show the vehicle stopping at around 6 feet more than it otherwise would. And that's, really, because as you said, bringing that information, that real-time information into those vehicle driving systems.\nSo for instance, if the tire is worn, if it's overloaded, if it's underinflated, and it's on a wet road, we can assess that real time, and then bring that into the vehicle driving systems to make that vehicle stop or perform more optimally than if those systems sought-- thought that the tire was actually brand new.\nAKIKO FUJITA: So we've got you-- right behind you, this truck, yeah? This is a partner of Goodyear. A fully self-driving--\nRICH KRAMER: Correct.\nAKIKO FUJITA: --truck for the middle mile, which in many ways is the most important right?\nRICH KRAMER: Exactly.\nAKIKO FUJITA: Can you talk to me about how that intelligent tire communicates with a truck with no driver in it?\nRICH KRAMER: Well. It's probably the best example that we have. Because when there is a driver, obviously, the driver can compensate for some of those conditions. But when there is no driver, as you mentioned in Gatik, we can actually take that-- we take that information and actually advise directly those driving systems. So it does everything I mentioned earlier.\nBut, what's even more important for a company like Gatik, as they expand their business, we can improve their cost per mile. We can improve their uptime as they do those deliveries. And what intelligence can do for them-- intelligent tire can do for them, is increase their use cases. So not only can they operate in a sunny environment with dry pavement, but they can also operate now where the roads may be wet, where the roads may be icy, where there's snow on the roads.\nAnd again, with no driver in the vehicle, the most important element that they're getting is what's happening on the road to advise those driving systems. That's what we can do for them. So it's a win-win for them in terms of their business model, in terms of safety, and in terms of their expansion.\nRelated Quotes\nTRENDING"

It employs about 74,000 people and manufactures its products in 57 facilities in 23 countries around the world. Its two Innovation Centers in Akron, Ohio, and Colmar-Berg, Luxembourg, strive to develop state-of-the-art products and services that set the technology and performance standard for the industry. For more information about Goodyear and its products, go to www.goodyear.com/corporate.\nAbout ZF\nZF is a global technology company supplying systems for passenger cars, commercial vehicles and industrial technology, enabling the next generation of mobility. ZF allows vehicles to see, think and act. In the four technology domains of Vehicle Motion Control, Integrated Safety, Automated Driving, and Electric Mobility, ZF offers comprehensive product and software solutions for established vehicle manufacturers and newly emerging transport and mobility service providers. ZF electrifies a wide range of vehicle types. With its products, the company contributes to reducing emissions, protecting the climate and enhancing safe mobility.\nWith some 165,000 employees worldwide, ZF reported sales of \u20ac43.8 billion in fiscal 2022. The company operates 168 production locations in 32 countries.\n*Goodyear SightLine, the company\u2019s suite of tire intelligence technologies, provides line of sight to the conditions of the tire, vehicle and road. The technology communicates tire state, identification, road friction and other tire characteristics. Goodyear SightLine will continue to provide this integral information to make fleets, vehicles and, in the future, autonomous driving systems safer and more efficient.\n** cubiX\u00ae, ZF's first pure software product, coordinates vehicle dynamics as a holistic system. ZF cubiX\u00ae can control braking and steering systems, the vehicle\u2019s (semi-) active damping system and further chassis and drive actuators. It offers another decisive advantage: The platform is compatible with various actuators such as dampers, brakes or rear-axle steering \u2013 regardless of the manufacturer or the specific design. This gives manufacturers the flexibility to implement different model series with one and the same control platform without additional integration effort. Future updates or upgrades to the software can be carried out \"over-the-air\" \u2013 i.e. wirelessly without a visit to the workshop.\nMEDIA\nCONTACT\nMatt Charboneau\n(313) 920-9056\nmatthew.charboneau@zf.com"
