        "raw_content": "Big Chinese companies brighten 2024 CES\nChinese technology companies have made a prominent comeback at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nAt the world's premier tech show in Las Vegas in the United States, they are showcasing their latest achievements in cutting-edge technologies. These range from artificial intelligence, next-generation semiconductor display, autonomous driving, robots to augmented reality.\nHighlighting that China is playing an increasingly vital role in bolstering technological innovation, experts said intelligent devices powered by generative AI and the internet of things are expected to become a key growth driver for global consumer electronics industry.\nAccording to the US Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, more than 4,000 enterprises from across the globe are participating in the CES, which opened on Tuesday and will conclude on Friday.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

The inset displays shaky cell phone video footage, filmed from the point of view of the child holding the cell phone. The series of footage shows a residential estate and our protagonist, Sofia, bending over the trunk of her car to remove a model. She straightens, turning until she smiles into the camera, seen against the background of houses, green foliage and a blue sky. We cut to aerial drone footage of a commercial building flanked by large car parks.\nInterview with Sofia\n[Title]\nDigital Transformation Lead\nSofia\nMy name is Sofia, and I\u2019m a working mum, but I\u2019m also a Digital and Transformation Lead at Shell.\n[Text displays]\nSofia Digital Transformation Lead\n[Video footage]\nWe see interior close-up footage of Sofia speaking to the off-camera interviewer, seen against an out-of-focus office background. A series of exterior slow-motion footage then shows Sofia striding across a paved entrance area towards the Shell building where she works.\nSofia\nEvery day, I\u2019m looking at how we can use digital technology to become more efficient.\n[Video footage]\nAgain, we see interior close-up footage of Sofia speaking to the off-camera interviewer, seen against the out-of-focus office background.\nChild\nBut what do you do?\nSofia\nGood question!\n[Video footage]\nWe return to the inset centred against a white background. The inset displays shaky cell phone video footage, filmed from the point of view of the child holding the cell phone. The series of footage shows Sofia in her home, placing a bowl of fruit on a table and then looking into the lens as she answers her child.\nSofia\nI\u2019m a champion for change.\n[Video footage]\nAgain, we see interior close-up footage of Sofia speaking to the off-camera interviewer, seen against an out-of-focus office background.\nSofia\nI feel very fortunate, because my work excites me.\n[Video footage]\nWe transition to a series of close-up shots that show Sofia zipping up her overall, clipping a gas detector to her lapel, and donning safety glasses beneath her Shell-branded hardhat. Next, we see wide low-angle footage of Sofia kitted out in safety attire, walking across an exterior paved area.\nSofia\nI\u2019m growing professionally, and I\u2019m involved in the energy transition.\n[Video footage]\nNext, we see Sofia getting up from her desk, carrying her laptop with her. We cut to close-up footage of her speaking straight into the camera, and we see a poster on the wall behind her. The poster has two Shell workers standing in front of an industrial plant. A graphic of multiple red, yellow and white lines sweeps through the scene.\nSofia\nIt\u2019s a really good feeling, because it\u2019s a big task and it matters.\n[Video footage]\nLow-angle footage shows Sofia onsite again, kitted in her safety gear. We cut to an aerial view of the industrial plant, then back to Sofia, now speaking directly into the camera as it swivels around her before pulling back rapidly.\nSofia\nI\u2019m very proud of where I work. I\u2019m actively playing my part. And to me, that feels good.\n[Video footage]\nA series of footage shows two of Sofia\u2019s colleagues onsite, using handheld devices and pointing up at the large storage tanks alongside them. We return to interior close-up footage of Sofia speaking to the off-camera interviewer, seen against an out-of-focus office background.\nSofia\nI\u2019ve been working for Shell for 16 years now, and I\u2019ve evolved.\n[Video footage]\nWe pull back on an aerial view of the industrial complex, then cut to tracking footage of Sofia striding away from a reception area and passing several doors as she approaches the shot. Close-up low-angle footage shows Sofia at her desk, opening her laptop. We return to close-up footage of Sofia speaking to the off-camera interviewer, seen against the out-of-focus office background.\nSofia\nChange came when I started my family. When I returned to work, Shell supported me to grow and develop.\n[Video footage]\nWe return to close-up low-angle footage of Sofia seated in her office chair, lifting a photo frame from her desk. We cut to close-up footage of the image in the photo frame, showing her children, a boy and a girl. We return to close-up footage of Sofia speaking to the off-camera interviewer, seen against the out-of-focus office background.\nSofia\nAnd I shifted from hands-on technical roles to more strategic thinking, like how we can continue to provide sustainable energy.\n[Video footage]\nNext, high-angle footage shows Sofia and colleagues seated around a boardroom table. We return to close-up footage of Sofia speaking to the off-camera interviewer, seen against the out-of-focus office background. We cut to close-up footage of wall-mounted screens, showing a presentation slide at frame-right and meeting software at frame-left, showing the other meeting participants. We return to footage of Sofia seated at the boardroom table.\nSofia\nThe culture here is collaborative, and that\u2019s something I find invigorating.\n[Video footage]\nTracking footage shows Sofia and a colleague walking down a corridor, seen first from behind, then in front view. Next, we see four colleagues walking side-by-side through a high-ceilinged open reception area, approaching the shot, followed by more footage of a group of colleagues engaged in discussion within an office environment.\nSofia\nWe know each other well. This facility and all the staff in it, we function like a family.\n[Video footage]\nA series of footage shows Sofia and other colleagues eating together around a table in a reception-style area with floor-to-ceiling windows on two sides. We cut to close-up footage of Sofia speaking to the off-camera interviewer, seen against the out-of-focus office background, before returning to more footage of the colleagues gathered around the table and talking and laughing together.\nSofia\nJust another day in the office. Let\u2019s see who\u2019s around.\nSofia\nMorning, Craig.\nCraig\nMorning, Sofia.\nSofia\nHow are you?\nCraig\nGood as always.\n[Video footage]\nWe see selfie footage of Sofia at work, speaking directly into the camera, then swiveling the camera around to film her colleague, Craig, as she greets him.\nSofia\nI think our world is changing, and we\u2019re seeing technology really come into spaces. So as that technology grows, it unlocks potential. Colleagues whose ideas inspire me, their resilience and focus is amazing.\n[Video footage]\nWe continue to see Sofia filming in the office as we see another colleague speaking into the lens while standing next to some very hi-tech-looking equipment. We see more exterior footage of two colleagues at the industrial plant, one operating a drone controller while the other looks up into the sky. We return to interior footage of Sofia sitting down with a colleague in front of a large screen and looking at and discussing the data displayed on the screen. We return to close-up footage of Sofia speaking to the off-camera interviewer, seen against the out-of-focus office background, then another series of exterior footage shows the colleagues at the plant as they engage with data on their handheld screens and operate the drone.\nSofia\nShell enables me to be the best version of myself, at home\u2026\n[Video footage]\nA series of footage shows Sofia at home with her children, as follows: sitting on the floor with the kids, playing with a snap circuit; brushing her daughter\u2019s hair; sitting on the floor again as they color in together; Sofia in the kitchen, lighting candles on a chocolate cake; Sofia smiling down into the lens and waving.\nSofia\nAnd at work.\n[Video footage]\nExterior low-angle footage shows Sofia in close-up, holding a touchscreen display, which we see from behind, and smiling. Next, we see profile-view footage of Sofia working at her desk.\nSofia\nThe most exciting thing about working for Shell is the chance to be a part of the future of the energy transition.\n[Video footage]\nA series of footage shows Sofia on site at the industrial plant; we see her surveying the plant and using her touchscreen display, and end on a profile-view close-up of her face.\nSofia\nAnd that\u2019s something I really want to tell my kids about.\n[Text displays]\nPower Your Progress\n[Video footage and animated sequence]\nWe zoom in on close-up footage of Sofia speaking into the camera, seen against the background of the floor-to-ceiling windows previously described. Over this, a yellow line draws the shape of a Pecten, and text displays below this. Then, concentric Pecten shapes pulsate out from the original shape until the frame is filled with radiating Pecten shapes.\n[Audio]\nBrand mnemonic played on strings.\n[Text displays]\nExplore careers at Shell shell.com/careers \u00a9 Shell International Limited 2023\n[Animated sequence]\nThe small classic red and yellow Pecten transitions in to display at frame-center against a white background.
