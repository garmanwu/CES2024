Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives.\nAs we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of\u00a0ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies,\u00a0new car tech, gaming gear and robots\u00a0-- there's even a robot for your dog.\nHere's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.\nRead more: \u00a0The Best of Show at CES 2024.\nAR/VR glasses that fit in one room\nApple may have stolen the show in absentia announcing that the Vision Pro would be available next month, but the headset is still insanely expensive at $3,500. While it's yet to be seen whether\u00a0AR/VR technology will take off, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, including the intriguing-looking Xreal Air 2 Ultra ($699). The Xreal is a lot more compact than the Apple behemoth, the price is relatively competitive and CNET's Lisa Eadiciccio was impressed by its image quality. However, she says the headset still needs to be tethered to another device, and it'll need third-party developers if it's to have a chance against Apple or even Google.\nA portable, add-on OLED display that folds\nSecondary displays are a productivity godsend, enabling the kind of multitasking that isn't possible even with the widest monitors. While portable solutions are available, the best solutions tend to be tethered to your desk. Maker Asus says the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH is the first portable OLED display -- and as the name suggests, it also folds! With the superior image quality of OLED, this 17.3-incher should be great for on-the-go movies or gaming, when it hits later in 2024.\nHitch a ride on a flying EV taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the debut of the Supernal S-A2.\nBanish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design\u00a0and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter. As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.\nThe future is electric\nHonda promises that the Saloon will match \"the joy of driving\" with steer-by-wire technology.\nAs we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle that could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the \"board room on wheels\" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs!\nThe most impressive, and most-likely concept to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing \"steer-by-wire\" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new \"floating H\" logo.\nFoldable phones? How about a foldable TV?\nThe C Seed N1, unfolded.\nWhat to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch C Seed N1 showed off at CES 2024.\nThe custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture,\nand its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk\nin about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV.\nOh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nSteam Deck has a new challenger\nMSI's new game handheld runs Windows but has Intel inside.\nAfter years of near misses such as the Steam Machine, the Steam Deck was an unexpected success for Valve, and the console is the current standard for mobile PC gaming. While the competing\u00a0Asus ROG Ally looked cool, using Windows on it was apparently pretty clunky. Now that situation might change with the help of Intel -- the company has a lot of experience making Windows machines. MSI's Claw handheld obviously owes a debt to the Steam Deck, but it has Intel's new Meteor Lake chips onboard instead of AMD chips. CNET's Scott Stein says this development means more manufacturers will have the opportunity to design their own Steam Deck-alikes that can also run Windows.\nWhat's old is new\nIf\nyou consider yourself an old-school smartphone user, you may yearn for\nthe physical keyboards that used to be a mainstay of the phones of\nyesteryear. The iPhone's on-screen keyboard ushered out the full\nphysical keyboards that were popular on\u00a0BlackBerry\u00a0devices.\nThe Clicks keyboard,\nfrom Clicks Technology, will transform your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15\nPro and Pro Max, adding a keyboard that's actually integrated into a\nwraparound case. This $139 wraparound slides onto your device and runs\noff the phone's battery, so no charging required. Be sure to check out our hands-on review.\nThis phone bends over backward for you\nAs phones with screens that fold in half get more consumer attention, Samsung appears to be poised to flip the market again. The electronics giant showcased a concept handset at\u00a0CES 2024 called the Flex In & Out Flip that can fold in both directions and completely backward, allowing you to use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nWhen bent backward, one side is slightly shorter than the other, to avoid covering the camera, while the larger side was big enough to show several icons in the phone's quick settings menu, media playback controls and the time and battery level. Although the handset is only a concept design right now, CNET's Lisa Eadicicco points out that it might offer a hint at the future of devices that roll, flex, bend, fold and otherwise contort to adapt tech to our unique needs.\nGet to work with this gaming laptop\nMore and more, we're asking our laptops to do double duty. In addition to strong gaming performance, we want to be able to use these thinner, lightweight devices for work or school. The HP Omen Transcend 14, which made its debut at CES 2024, is light enough for a daily commute but sports a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display with a 48-120Hz variable refresh rate backed up by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070.\nThe 14-inch laptop weighs only 3.6 pounds (1.6 kilograms) -- light for a gaming laptop and has battery life good for up to 11.5 hours with the integrated graphics and an Eco mode. The new 14-inch size starts at $1,500. A 16-inch version will also be available with the option for a 4K 240Hz OLED starting at $1,900.\nThis thermometer also checks your heart and lungs\nIf you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer,\nelectrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was\nunveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you \"beam it,\" the device can give you clues about your health.\nThe device, which Withings describes as being \"portable and smaller than a smartphone,\"\ncombines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of\nthe wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like\nblood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used\nas a \"digital stethoscope.\"\nFollowing expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nForget a projector, get a huge TCL instead\nThe TCL 115QM891G is a 115-inch TV that's 8.5 feet wide and around 6 feet tall on its stand.\nCNET's projector reviewer Geoff Morrison has been extolling the benefits of projectors for many years, but even he has come around to technologies like OLED and Mini-LED of late. What would he think of the new TCL 115QM891G? This is a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's up to five times brighter than most TVs, and with better blacks too, according to TV reviewer David Katzmaier.\nAs TV reviewers ourselves we've seen large TVs, but in the old days they were stuck at HD. The pixels on Panasonic's\u00a0103-inch 1080p, for instance, were huge and easily noticeable. This is why 4K technology is so great -- it means you can install a TV as big as a wall, and not see black lines between the pixels. The TCL is also going to be a lot cheaper than that $100,000 Panasonic too, at under $20,000.\nStained glass gets a new lease on lifelong power\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nSolar panels are great -- they produce electricity from one of the most abundant resources we have, and they pay for themselves in quick order -- but no one has ever called them pretty. Fear not! Japanese company inQs has worked out a way to make solar cells out of colored glass. The company is exhibiting a number of objects at CES 2024, including a\u00a0stained glass pane that generates electricity. The devices are small, and one was able to power only a desk fan, but we like how they point to a rethink of how solar panels should look and work.\nDisguising weird-looking things has been a perpetual trend at CES, as with LG's ArtCool air conditioners. And this year the Samsung Music Frame lets you put art inside a smart speaker.\nHey, Ida, which is better: Alexa or Siri?\nAI is already everywhere here at CES 2024 -- and adding to the list of products it'll be appearing in is cars. Volkswagen has announced a deal with ChatGPT that\u00a0enables users to ask all sorts of questions of their car, in the same way they would of a traditional digital assistant. At the moment, VW's voice assistant lets users say, \"Hey, Ida,\" to ask a question about something basic, like requesting tire pressure. But the automaker's cars are incapable of answering more advanced questions like, \"When did the New York Jets last win the Super Bowl?\" Under the new deal, if the car's assistant can't answer the question, it'll hand off the query to ChatGPT. (Yes, the Jets did win one. But it was a very, very long time ago.)\nIt's worth noting that competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri have been completing these queries natively for many years, so teaming with ChatGPT is an easier way for VW's Ida to catch up.\nMust-see-through TV\nThis transparent display, currently showing fish, can transform into a 77-inch TV.\nTVs are getting bigger every year, which means there's a bigger slab of black plastic taking up a significant portion of the living room wall when it's not in use. But what if we could make it disappear, without actually pulling it off the wall?\nLG has apparently done just that with a\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0that converts from a \"fish tank\" to a 77-inch television (pictured above). Unlike Samsung's competing technology this will apparently be a real product, shipping later in 2024.\nMeanwhile Samsung is showing off the first transparent version of its\u00a0Micro-LED display tech\u00a0at\u00a0CES 2024. While transparent OLED and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, Samsung says its Micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the current tech. But Samsung says its transparent Micro-LED tech isn't available in the market, so what Katzmaier saw (or didn't see?) is essentially a concept.\nA 2-minute ice cream maker\nWe scream for ice cream.\nComing soon to a restaurant near you: freshly made ice cream, ready from start to finish in just 2 minutes.\nWe've loved trying the vanilla ice cream churned out by the speedy ColdSnap -- first in 2021 and then again this year. We're still a year away from being able to buy one of these innovative ice cream makers for our homes, but the company came to CES this year with the news that its restaurant partners will have hold of the machines much sooner.\nThe countertop ice cream maker uses Keurig-like pods to make a bowl of the cold stuff in less than 2 minutes. The finished result has a gelato-like consistency that had us coming back for more every time we passed the ColdSnap booth.\nRobot stain fighter\nSamsung is set to unveil its Bespoke Jet Bot Combo this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nHere's a product sure to clean up -- literally. Samsung's new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, a smart robot vacuum with a mop, does more than just get rid of dust bunnies and dog hair. It's designed to roam your rooms scouting for stains on hard flooring and scrub them out so you don't have to.\nThe robot taps AI-powered object recognition to identify stains on hard flooring. Yes, it can tell the difference between the surfaces, presumably making adjustments to its cleaning technique accordingly. You can also tell this likely $1,000-plus household helper where it can and can't go as it attacks stains as bad as a puppy piddle or a zinfandel spill with a spinning mop that hits 170 rpm. (Pricing details aren't yet available.)\nTeeth tech\nAI isn't just helping keep your floors clean, it's also being used to make sure your teeth are as clean as they can be. The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush features an algorithm-controlled motor, five brush modes tailored to specific needs, an interactive touchscreen that shows you areas you missed and, brilliantly/weirdly, an AI voice guide that speaks into your brain via bone conduction to help you improve your technique.\nIt also features Wi-Fi connectivity so you can pair it with your home network, and it will store information about your brushing history until you can download it to your app. It also offers 40 days of battery life through wireless charging. It will go on sale in the US in the fall for $130.\nIt's all in the wristwatch remote\nWhat if your smartwatch could also control your lamps, your Netflix programs and more?\nImagine using your wrist to control everything around you. A flick this way, and you can turn off the lights or scroll through the offerings on Netflix. Finnish startup Doublepoint has developed software that can turn an Android watch into a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection.\nThe software will come to developers in the first half of this year,\nbut it's up to developers and app-makers to decide what a small gesture, such as tapping fingers or rotating your wrist, will actually do.\nSteven Musil, Sareena Dayaram, Katie Collins and Ty Pendlebury contributed to this article.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

They also boasted about their supply chain prowess and the ability to manufacture leading technologies in-house.\nDavid Gold, president of Hisense USA, said the company's ability to produce displays and even its own AI chipsets without third parties is something that sets it apart.\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\"When you think about global players, I think we are one of less than a handful of companies that have everything that it takes to be able to truly provide a smart home solution,\" Gold said after the Hisense presentation. \"We have all the ingredients, all the components. There are very few companies out there that can do the same.\"\nThe flagship product from Hisense this year is its new 110-inch ULED X television with a brightness of 10,000 nits and 40,000 backlight zones.\nNot to be outdone, TCL announced what it said is the world's largest mini-LED TV at 115 inches. TCL referred to itself as a \"great global power\" with 32 research and development centres and 43 manufacturing sites around the world.\nMini LEDs featured prominently in the presentations of both Hisense and TCL, as they each presented their brands as the best option for finding this tech in TVs that cost just a few hundred dollars, rather than thousands.\nHisense said that mini LEDs - which cram more LEDs into a display to offer a greater range of contrast and image quality - are now integrated into all its models, including one for under US$500.\nHisense also introduced its new so-called laser TVs, which are projectors combined with an ambient-light-rejecting screen. The company said its newest 8K Sonic Laser TV is the \"world's largest sound-emitting screen\", offering a sound bar-like experience built into the projector. It is also offering a new Rollable Laser TV, which is exactly what it sounds like: a projector screen that rolls up and disappears, offering a cleaner look at home when not in use.\nBoth companies used sports to draw attention to their new TVs. As more viewers switch to streaming, the focus on live television has largely fallen to sports, a major reason households remain subscribed to cable and satellite TV packages.\nTCL leaned into this heavily, inviting sportscasters including Charissa Thompson and former National Football League player Charles Woodson on stage for nearly the entire duration of the presentation.\nStefan Streit, chief marketing officer of TCL Communication, introduces the RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, January 8, 2024. Photo: Bloomberg alt=Stefan Streit, chief marketing officer of TCL Communication, introduces the RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, January 8, 2024. Photo: Bloomberg>\nHisense highlighted the ability of its AI chips to enhance picture quality by identifying whether the video is coming from streaming, cable or another source.\n\"[Our AI is] about recognising what content it is, the quality, the factor in which it's being displayed - whether it's streaming, cable, DVDs, Blu-ray - and finding the way to enhance that picture quality,\" Gold said. \"Usually you put in one setting and never change it again. What we're trying to do with AI is automatically detect, 'Oh, now you're watching football, let's move to a sport setting'.\"\nSeemingly omnipresent at CES 2024, AI was mentioned repeatedly during both presentations, as it has been by rivals like Samsung and LG.\nTCL talked of enhancing access to its AI processing with three levels of its AIPQ processors, which include \"pro\" and \"ultra\" versions. The AI processors are now offered in its cheaper S Class series.\nWhile TVs are typically the highlight for these events from the Chinese display giants, they are also chasing other trends in the industry. TCL mentioned the latest version of the RayNeo X2 smart glasses, which can display images on the lenses to do things like offer real-time text translation. TCL incubated RayNeo.\nThe company also highlighted its newest smartphones and tablets with an emphasis on its Nxtpaper display, which is meant to be easier on the eyes like e-reader displays.\nHisense is working on its own augmented reality (AR) glasses and a virtual reality headset, but both are just prototypes for now.\nHisense US president David Gold speaks during a presentation at CES 2024, January 8, 2024.

Photo: EPA-EFE>\nIt has also followed many of its Chinese peers - like Xiaomi and Huawei Technologies - into the auto sector. It is working on bringing its projector technology into cars to, among other things, turn the windscreen into an AR display. The company said this enhances safety because drivers do not need to take their eyes off the road when getting information like navigation.\n\"If you're on the road and your smart refrigerator can tell you, 'hey, you're out of eggs; so on your way home, stop by and pick up some eggs,' that's the idea that we're going for,\" Gold said.\nMany tech firms are betting on cars as the next big area of growth. As leaders in electric vehicles, Chinese companies are benefiting from the trend. Carmakers Li Auto, Great Wall Motor, Zeekr and Xiaomi will all use Nvidia's Drive tech for autonomous driving, the chip firm announced on Monday.\nSamsung and Sony also discussed their own partnerships with carmakers in their presentations on Monday. Sony has partnered with Honda on its Afeela joint venture, while Samsung is partnering with Hyundai to bring its SmartThings platform to cars.\n.\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: Everything you need to know about the camera and tech showcase\nThe world's biggest technology show, CES 2024 is taking place in Las Vegas next week.\u00a0What camera kit will be there?\nCES 2024, the biggest technology event in the world, is taking place next week \u2013\u00a0and it's going to be the site of some huge announcements in the world of electronics.\nAs always (at least, when there's not a pandemic), CES 2024 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada and runs from January 09-12. Last year saw 117,000 visitors and 3,200 exhibitors at the event, including the biggest technology giants such as Google and Microsoft.\nOf specific interest to us, of course, are the imaging giants who are participating at this year's show: Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Adobe. While CES 2024 is a general technology showcase, not one dedicated to photography or videography in specific, it has been used as a launchpad for cameras and imaging tech. And with both video and AI being cornerstones of this year's event, we're sure to see some exciting launches.\nFull details on the show can be found at the CES website.\u00a0For now, here's what we're excited about and what we expect to see\u2026\nWhen is CES 2024?\nCES 2023 will take place in its traditional home of Las Vegas, Nevada, running from Tuesday January 09 to Friday January 12.\nThe event emanates from the Las Vegas Convention Center. If you're in the area, attendance details are on the CES website.\nWhat do we expect at CES 2024?\nSony\nWord has it that Sony could announce five cameras this year, among them the Sony A1 II, A7S IV, FX3 II and ZV-E10 II. With all of these featuring headline video capabilities, it would certainly be the right time and place to debut at the video-obsessed CES.\nPersonally I think it's waaaaaay too early for a Sony A1 successor, though with a new rumor that the company could replace the Sony A7S III (and the A7S line altogether) and the Sony FX3 with the FX3 II, this feels like a new pillar that would be well-cemented in Las Vegas.\nPanasonic\nThere's been plenty of chatter about replacements for the Panasonic S1 / S1R, Panasonic S1H and Panasonic GH6. And given that the company launched the Panasonic S5X and S5 IIX last January, it's entirely possible that an S1R II, S1H II and GH7 could be revealed at CES 2024.\nOf course, as a general tech giant, we could see plenty of other adjacent imaging breakthroughs. At last year's show Panasonic announced \"life changing\" smart glasses, made in conjunction with Biel Glasses, using AI to help users with impaired vision.\nHeck, maybe we might finally see Panasonic announce something 8K-related\u2026\nCanon\nWill CES 2024 be the launchpad for the highly anticipated Canon EOS R1? We all know that the new flagship is on the way, and that it's intended to launch in time for the Paris Olympics, so time is running out for Canon to show it to the world.\nThere are plenty of other possibilities, too. The Canon EOS R5 II feels a little ambitious, but Canon has a habit of showcasing its latest collection of concept cameras \u2013\u00a0many of which have made it to market, such as the Canon PowerShot Zoom and Canon PowerShot Pick. These are always fascinating glimpses into the future, and I'm excited to see what's on show this year!\nNikon\nAfter a knockout year in 2023, Nikon could capitalize by taking the bull by the horns early in 2024. The likeliest candidate to me would be the Nikon Z6 III, which is widely expected to be here any minute.\nThere has also been a wild rumor about a Nikon Z9H \u2013\u00a0a speed-oriented version of the Nikon Z9. The \"H\" is ostensibly a nod to the suffix Nikon used to give to its flagship cameras to denote particular performance specialisms \u2013\u00a0such as the Nikon D1H, which was a speed-oriented upgrade of the base D1.\u00a0Personally I'll believe this one when I see it!\nFujifilm\nThis feels like a bit of a long shot, as Fujifilm is usually more at home announcing products on its home turf at CP+. That said, with reports that the manufacturer will launch more cameras in January alone than it did in 2023 as a whole, a launch or announcement isn't out of the question.\nWhat could this be? Well, a follow-up to the Fujifilm X100V is widely expected \u2013 and given what a blockbuster success that camera was, it could be a good fit for the broader-appeal of CES 2024. An outside chance would be the Instax Mini 99, which sounds like it might be a disruptive product.\nCES 2024 announcements\nLaCie Rugged Mini SSD\nThe palm-sized LaCie Rugged Mini SSD has been announced in capacities up to 4TB offering IP54 dust and rain resistance, 3-meter drop protection and 1-ton car pressure resistance.\u00a0No need to baby your portable SSD any more!\nLaCie claims write speeds of up to 2000MB/s, with USB 3.2 gen 2x2 and compatibility with USB 40Gbps, USB 10Gps, Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts including the latest Apple iPad, iPhone and Macbooks. Prices start at $79.99 for 500GB and go up to $349.99 for 4TB.\nFull story: LaCie adds to its famous Rugged lineup with a new palm-sized SSD\nWith a good few days to go until the event kicks off, there will be plenty more news, announcements and leaks between now and doors opening. Stay tuned to this page where we'll keep you updated with all the launches as they happen!\nWe're expecting to see some of the best cameras for video and maybe even the best cameras for vlogging announced at the show, along with AI improvements to the best photo editing software and the best video editing software.\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\nGet the Digital Camera World Newsletter\nThe best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!\nThe editor of Digital Camera World, James has 21 years experience as a journalist and started working in the photographic industry in 2014 (as an assistant to Damian McGillicuddy, who succeeded David Bailey as Principal Photographer for Olympus).

The land is currently undeveloped, and the filings don\u2019t detail how many buildings the company would be looking to construct. The commission is due to meet to discuss the proposal later this week.\nThe application was submitted by DuPont co-founder Lammot J. du Pont and Vizsla Ventures LLC and includes references to a company known as Vu Ventures LLC. However, a now-removed internal company magazine from engineering firm Gordon Inc. -- which is featured in the planning documents as involved in the project -- notes the connection between the Dulles Berry project and CloudHQ.\nAs part of the original 2018 proposal for data centers on the site \u2013 seemingly filed by an affiliate of QTS \u2013 the owners dedicated a 100-foot wide corridor along the eastern boundary line of the Property immediately adjacent to the Board Run to the county.\nPlans for a Dulles Berry campus have seemingly been in the works since around 2018, according to other filings with the county; it has undergone several revisions involving the site's visual and environmental impacts.
