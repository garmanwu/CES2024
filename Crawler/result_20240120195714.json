I am super-excited to be back in Las Vegas leading our\u00a0Executive Briefing & Floor Tours\u00a0team. CES is one of the world\u2019s largest and most important technology-focused trade events. There will be upwards of 150,000 people, more than 3,000 exhibitors and over 2 million square feet of exhibit space. With so much to see and do, it can be overwhelming. That\u2019s where we come in. We make CES smaller, more digestible and (IMHO) more valuable to your team by crafting bespoke, strategically relevant, walking tours of the show. Our Executive Briefings & Floor Tours have a singular mission \u2013 to help you maximize your time at CES.\nEvery year, CES functions as a highly reliable crystal ball. Wondering what will empower consumers in 12 months? Look at this year\u2019s tech offerings. Want to know what consumers will be buying in 18 months? Pay attention to the products that will ship in Q3 of next year. Want to know what\u2019s on the horizon? Spend time with the big manufacturers to see what\u2019s on the drawing board. Wondering about potential investment or business opportunities? CES is the best place to formulate and test your technology-based ideas. It is one of our \u201cnot so secret\u201d secret weapons.\nWhat are Executive Briefings & Floor Tours?\nOur Executive Briefings & Floor Tours are 90-minute curated expeditions exploring significant trends and emerging technologies, ensuring your experience at CES is not just informative, but transformative. Each tour is custom-crafted for your team and designed to provide a razor-sharp focus and actionable insights amidst the backdrop of CES.\nAI Is The Story, But There\u2019s More To See\nAI is being incorporated into almost every technology you\u2019re likely to see at the show and we will cover it extensively. But there\u2019s much more to see and do at CES. We\u2019re excited about innovation in Media, Fintech, Consumer Touch Points, Mobile and Wireless, Automotive, Sustainability and Immersive Experiences, to name a few.\nOur Executive Briefings & Floor Tours are not just about traversing the expo; they are about understanding the pulse of technological evolution and deriving actionable insights that echo beyond the halls of CES. It\u2019s about leveraging the CES narrative to inform your technology strategy, ensuring you are not just a spectator, but a strategic player in the tech-driven narrative unfolding.\nLearning More\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about what we\u2019re doing at CES 2024, you can\u00a0learn more here.\nAuthor\u2019s note: This is not a sponsored post.

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nCES\u00ae 2024 was like stepping into a sci-fi movie. Only the popcorn was real, and the special effects were available for pre-order. I walked all 2 million square feet of exhibit space (several times) using one essential filter: \u201cTechnology is meaningless unless it changes the way we behave.\u201d While it\u2019s true that AI was the overarching theme of this year\u2019s show \u2013 that\u2019s like saying integrated circuits, or data, or electricity were the theme of the show. AI is table stakes now. It\u2019s incorporated everywhere it\u2019s needed (like all of the other enabling technologies), so there\u2019s no need to call it out. That said, there were a few standouts in Las Vegas last week. Here\u2019s a short list of my favorites.\nSamsung\u2019s Transparent MicroLED Displays\nThis was the \u201cwow\u201d moment of CES 2024. Nothing prepares you for this engineering tour de force. Samsung displayed the transparent screens in front of traditional MicroLED monitors creating a visually stunning 3D effect that literally left you speechless. The tech has no price, no launch date, and you\u2019ll have to think very hard about where you might put such a display to use. Clearly (no pun intended), there are commercial, experiential, and artistic uses for transparent screens, but I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s ever going to replace the 75\u2033 flatscreen in your living room. Learn more.\nSony Torchlight\nSony Pictures Entertainment was showing off Torchlight, a new advanced visualization facility located at Sony Pictures in Culver City. Torchlight allows filmmakers to create digital scenes before principal photography, in a hands-on virtual environment using Unreal Engine and virtual cameras. The facility also gives filmmakers the flexibility to communicate to stakeholders in real-time and with unique specificity in film production. Torchlight is operational and currently working on several projects. Learn more.\nGE Indoor Smoker\nThe GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker was \u201cMy Favorite Thing at CES (and CES hasn\u2019t started yet).\u201d When I got to see it in-person, it did not disappoint. This countertop appliance, equipped with Active Smoke Filtration, offers a unique solution for imparting wood-smoked flavors in any kitchen setting. The system efficiently turns wood pellets into smoke, then magically transforms it into cooking air, all without setting off your smoke alarm. The smoker comes with a companion app that lets you control the temperature, smoke level, and cooking time. Importantly, the racks and drip tray are dishwasher safe.\nASUS Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe ASUS Zenbook DUO was my favorite dual-screen laptop at the show. It features two full-size OLED touchscreens, a detachable full-size keyboard, and a built-in kickstand. With dual 14-inch 3K OLED 120 Hz displays, you can instantly expand your workspace up to 19.8 inches. The Zenbook DUO is powered by an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor and 32 GB LPDDR5x memory, plus up to a 2 TB PCIe\u00ae 4.0 SSD. It also features dedicated smart software, intuitive gesture control, and an enhanced-lifespan 75 Wh battery. (Too geeky? Probably. But this is a sweet laptop.)\nWithings Beam-O\nWithings Beam-O is a new connected health device that combines four medical tools: a stethoscope, an oximeter, a 1-lead ECG and a thermometer. The device provides a comprehensive set of vital signs that can be used for in-person and telehealth medical appointments.

The show was crowded and full of life and positive energy. It was great to see old friends, meet new ones, and to spend time with people IRL. Online meetings are a technological marvel, but nothing beats coming together as a community to learn about (and celebrate) the science and technology that is changing our world.

The new IoT devices are designed to reshape how users interact with their smart homes and businesses, offering more memory, compatibility, and extended functionalities.\nMore memory, More Power\nThe Gen3 series ensures quality and reliability by using Shelly's own powerful new chip. Boasting 8MB of memory, this dramatically improves device performance and efficiency. This significant increase in memory not only guarantees smoother and faster operation, but also equips the Gen3 series for the introduction of new capabilities.\nUnified Control with Virtual Components\nThe Gen3 Series introduces \"virtual components\", transforming how users manage and control 3rd party devices. Within the Shelly Smart Control app, consumers can now create virtual devices, integrating non-Shelly products into a unified control system. This feature provides streamlined control of all users' smart devices, regardless of brand, from a single interface.\nOn the Road to Matter\nEach Gen3 device is engineered to be upgradable to Matter - an industry\u2013unifying standard, promising reliable and secure connectivity. With double the memory,* all Gen3 devices guarantee a smooth update process, while paving the way for new smart capabilities and integrations.\nWith a focus on enhancing the user experience, Shelly has listened to the needs and feedback of its growing community of users. Through its dedication to innovation, the company takes the next important step towards revolutionizing the way users live and work, creating a space where convenience, security, and energy efficiency go hand in hand.\n\"We are thrilled to showcase our next generation products at CES 2024.\" said Dimitar Dimitrov, Co-CEO of Shelly Group. \"With increased memory capacity and enhanced capabilities, users can experience enhanced product functionalities and reliability of our devices. These new products mark a significant milestone for us as we continue to deliver cutting-edge solutions that empower our users to create truly smart homes and businesses.\"\n\"We feel confident in achieving our targets not only in terms of annual revenue but also in the number of products delivered. We are growing faster than the market, and that puts us in a position where we can offer our clients and partners the best solutions for their needs due to our short idea-to-market process. In 2023, we achieved our medium-term targets of revenue of more than EUR 200.0 million and we are well positioned to achieve EBIT of more than EUR 50.0 million by the end of 2026,\" adds Wolfgang Kirsch, Co-CEO of Shelly Group.\nAt CES 2024, Shelly Group will present more than 10 products, some with Z-wave wireless communication protocol, to answer the growing needs of its U.S. customers.\nOne of the flagship products is Shelly H&T Gen3, the next generation Wi-Fi smart sensor that accurately tracks temperature and humidity, both essential for a healthy home environment. It features an e-paper graphic display, for seamless climate control in your living space. Shelly H&T Gen3 will amaze users with an exceptional experience. Equipped with the Shelly chip, featuring 8MB of memory, it doubles the efficiency and responsiveness of the previous generation. The leap in memory capacity prepares Gen3 devices for extended features, and provides smoother operation and quicker responses, ensuring your environment is monitored with unparalleled precision and ease.\nAnother highly anticipated product series that Shelly Group will present is the Shelly Mini Gen3 Series. Designed with convenience in mind, these mini relays have all the capabilities of the Gen3 devices but in a space-saving form. With their size reduced to 35% of the Shelly Plus devices (e.g. Shelly Plus 1 Mini), the products are perfect for those tight spaces where traditional relays simply won't fit. Despite their small size, the Shelly Mini Gen3 devices do not compromise on performance or functionality. Among the smallest relays in the world, these Gen3 devices allow users to automate their lights, garage door, irrigation system, or small electrical appliances in less than 10 minutes and control them from anywhere. Small enough to fit behind any wall switch or socket, these Shelly\u00a0Mini Gen3\u00a0devices\u00a0can be retrofitted and are highly compatible with many existing smart ecosystems.\nShelly Qubino Wave Plug US\u00a0is the Z-wave product that will hit the U.S. market following CES to meet the needs of local users. Shelly Qubino is a line of innovative microprocessor-managed devices which allows remote control of electric appliances with a smartphone, tablet, PC, or home automation system. They work on Z-Wave\u2122 wireless communication protocol, using a gateway.\nWith Shelly Qubino Wave Plug US, users can control a wide range of home appliances and office equipment (lights, power lines, security systems, heating radiators, air conditioners, etc.) from anywhere with even greater use.\nTo learn more about Shelly Group and its latest generation of smart automation solutions for home and work, visit Shelly Group's website at\u00a0www.shelly.com/en-us, or join them at CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 9th to 12th,\u00a0Booth #53517\u00a0at the Venetian.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: 5 new tech products stealing the show this year\nThe annual Consumer Technology Show rolled into the Las Vegas Convention Center last week. These are what we think are the most interesting pieces of tech coming from the event.\nWhile the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) was dominated by artificial intelligence (AI) embedded into everything from laptops to TVs, tech companies also used the Las Vegas showroom floor to\u00a0highlight other kinds of cutting-edge innovation.\nFrom telescopes perfect for stargazing with friends to a transparent television, the trade show exhibited a range of exciting new gadgets that we expect to hit the market in 2024 and beyond. Here are some of our favorites.\nOdyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes\nUnistellar revealed new Odyssey and Odyssey Pro smart telescopes, which are designed to make stargazing and capturing images of the night sky easier.\nThe telescopes are fitted with 'autonomous field detection technology' that helps stargazers to locate and view astronomical objects. Pairing the telescopes with the Unistellar app (available on Android and iOS) means users with no prior experience can navigate the night sky easily and can save images of observed objects to share with their friends.\nThe new smart telescopes, jointly developed by Nikon and Unistellar, were first announced in 2021 but are only now becoming available to the public.\nFor products that are intended to make skywatching more accessible, both have a hefty price tag, with the Unistellar Odyssey priced at $2,499 and the Unistellar Odyssey Pro at $3,999 \u2014 a premium price even for more advanced telescopes.\nRelated: Best telescopes for stargazing\nLG\u2019s transparent OLED TV\nA see-through TV may not have been on your radar, beyond the odd appearance in science fiction, but LG revealed the completely transparent LG Signature OLED T at CES.\nThis 77-inch TV is designed to blend seamlessly into a room's decor, resembling an art installation more than a classic TV, so you could, theoretically, even place it in front of a window without ruining the view.\nUnlike other concept products, LG actually plans to launch this device, although the company didn't specify a release date or price.\nRelated: 16 tech projects from 2023 that could change the world\nApple's Vision Pro mixed reality headset\nAfter revealing its Vision Pro mixed-reality device in June 2023, Apple used CES to finally announce it will be available to pre-order, with a release date of Feb 2 for customers in the United States.\nThe headset, priced at $3,499, is Apple's first new major product line since the Apple Watch launched in 2015. It augments the real world with a digital overlay, and users can control the device using their voice, gaze and hand gestures.\nWith features like sensors, cameras and built-in spatial audio speakers, the headset also lets users switch between augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR).\nRelated: Best VR mindfulness games\nSwarovski's animal-identifying smart binoculars\nSwarovski Optik showcased the AX Visio, a pair of smart binoculars, that can identify different species of animals and insects \u2014 perfect for wildlife enthusiasts.\nThe 10x32 binoculars use built-in AI to identify species of birds, insects and mammals, showing you the name of that species when you lock onto the creature in the viewfinder.\nThere is also a dial in the middle to switch between animal identification, a compass and even a 4K camera setting. Users can store around 1,700 photos or one hour of video in full quality, which you can then download to smartphones or devices.\nThe high-tech binoculars will be unsurprisingly expensive,\u00a0costing $4,799 when they are released in\u00a0February.\nRelated: Best binoculars for wildlife spotting 2024\nThe HRM-Fit sports bra heart rate monitor\nGarmin announced a new $149.99 heart rate monitor at CES called the HRM-Fit. It's designed for people to attach to sports bras from a wide range of manufacturers, including Adidas and Athleta. It can capture training data like ground contact time balance and stride length, as well as real-time heart rate, without compromising movement or performance.\nThe device then transmits this information to other fitness devices like Garmin smartwatches or Edge cycling computers, as well as compatible fitness apps like Tacx Training.\nUsers will need a compatible Garmin device to get the most out of the HRM-Fit, but even without one, the HRM-Fit can capture information on steps, calories burned, intensity minutes and all-day heart rate.\nRelated: Best fitness trackers 2024\nSign up for the Live Science daily newsletter now\nGet the world\u2019s most fascinating discoveries delivered straight to your inbox.\nOrla is an NCTJ-trained journalist with a background in beauty, lifestyle and technology commerce journalism and has worked for leading titles such as The Mirror and MailOnline.

It is not intended to address all design conditions or specialized situations. Public or private sector projects submitted for initial review after November 27, 2023, must comply with all standards in the 2023 Infrastructure Design Manual. For Capital Projects, Phase II final designs (60% submittals) that are submitted for a review on or after November 27, 2023, are required to comply with the 2023 Infrastructure Design Manual.\nCurrent IDM Requirements\nCurrent Additional GIS\u00a0Guidelines\nHistorical IDM Requirements\nIDM Webinar\nThe IDM webinar covers the changes made during the review cycle and implemented into the current publication of the IDM.

The Product Approval list includes products that have been reviewed and approved by Houston Public Works for use in water, wastewater, storm, and street and bridge systems that fall within the ROW. These products comply with applicable standards and demonstrate satisfactory performance. This list is representative of products that have been reviewed, their compliance with the construction specification at the time of submission verified and accepted as a product that meets the need of most City projects and ultimately benefits the City.\nInclusion in the list does not guarantee that the product will be used in all City projects. All products are subject to review and approval by the Engineer of Record per the City\u2019s 00700 document and 01330 submittal specification for use in City projects. A product not listed in the list may be used in City project if it meets the construction specifications and is reviewed and approved by the Engineer of Record for that project through the submittal process. The City does not endorse the products in the list, neither does it intend to discourage the use of products that are not included in the list.\nProduct manufacturers or vendors that are interested in having their products reviewed and listed in the product approval list are required to apply for review.
