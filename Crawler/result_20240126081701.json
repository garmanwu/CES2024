This technology is the world's first to realize blind typing, which enables keystrokes without checking the position of the keys with the eyes in a Mini QWERTY size that fits in one hand. It also enhances the user experience by using a universal QWERTY arrangement, making it easy for the visually impaired to use 'FINTIN V1' with little practice.\nAdditional features include dedicated keys for screen readers such as VoiceOver (iOS) and TalkBack (Android), along with haptic feedback, enabling visually impaired users to access the full range of smartphone functions without the need for manual operation.\nVisually impaired people face many challenges in the smartphone era, dominated by touch interfaces that require visual confirmation. On-screen keyboards cannot accurately distinguish keys by touch, requiring more effort to input text.\nWith FINTIN V1, ONECOM has removed this barrier, significantly improving access to social digital connectivity for the visually impaired.\nIt is ONECOM's vision to realize a world where the world's 285 million visually impaired people can independently socialize with non-disabled people, communicate in real-time, educate, interact, work, live their daily lives, and create content.\nThe Structured Mini QWERTY technology used in the FINTIN V1 is set to be implemented not only in products designed for the visually impaired but also in a wide range of text input devices. This includes console game controllers, smart TV remote controllers, and controllers for Metaverse/XR headsets, enhancing compatibility and user experience across various platforms.\nONECOM's award-winning products, recognized for their innovation at CES, will be showcased at CES 2024 in Las Vegas on January 9, 2024, at the KOTRA Korea Pavilion in Eureka Park.
