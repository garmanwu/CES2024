        "raw_content": "Big Chinese companies brighten 2024 CES\nChinese technology companies have made a prominent comeback at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nAt the world's premier tech show in Las Vegas in the United States, they are showcasing their latest achievements in cutting-edge technologies. These range from artificial intelligence, next-generation semiconductor display, autonomous driving, robots to augmented reality.\nHighlighting that China is playing an increasingly vital role in bolstering technological innovation, experts said intelligent devices powered by generative AI and the internet of things are expected to become a key growth driver for global consumer electronics industry.\nAccording to the US Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, more than 4,000 enterprises from across the globe are participating in the CES, which opened on Tuesday and will conclude on Friday. Of these, 1,114 are from China and 1,201 are based in the US.\nAI-powered terminal devices are attracting attention this year amid a worldwide frenzy over the ChatGPT chatbot. Chinese consumer electronics maker TCL demonstrated over 120 pieces of intelligent hardware covering quantum dot mini-LED TVs, AI processing chips, smartphones, intelligent AR goggles and vehicle-mounted display products.\nThe company is accelerating efforts to expand presence in North America by boosting production capacity at its Mexican factory, given that building global competitiveness has always been important for TCL.\nHisense Group, a major Chinese home appliance manufacturer, unveiled its latest ultra light-emitting diode or ULED TV and laser display technology at the CES.\nDavid Gold, vice-president of Hisense International, said at a product launch event that display technology is widely applied in sports, education and medical fields, continuously pushing technological boundaries.\nLenovo Group Ltd, the world's largest personal computer maker, unveiled a full lineup of more than 40 new devices and solutions powered by AI at the CES. It said it believes this year will mark the advent of AI-based PCs.\nXpeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's Xpeng Motors, showcased its pilotless flying car, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft at the CES.\n\"Chinese tech companies are at the forefront of technological innovation globally, and actively promoting the application of AI in consumer electronics, intelligent devices and electric vehicles,\" said Hong Yong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe latest technological breakthroughs made by Chinese companies in the fields of virtual reality and autonomous driving also reflect their strengths and innovative capabilities in crucial technologies, which will be conducive to industrial upgrades and boosting their own competitiveness on the global stage, Hong said.\nChinese augmented reality company Xreal showcased its latest AR-enabled innovative products by partnering with companies such as Qualcomm and BMW.\nCES attendees can join a Las Vegas tour hosted by BMW, where they will have the opportunity to experience Xreal's AR glasses along the way. They can witness how in-car information, including navigation cues, hazard warnings, entertainment content and charging station details seamlessly integrate into the real environment through Xreal Air 2 glasses.\nJin Peng, co-founder of Xreal, said, \"In the future world, whether it's in offices or entertainment, for mobile commuting or personal enjoyment, people will engage in work and experience life in new and creative ways.\"\nChinese tech companies have shown the potential to lead the industry not only in mature categories such as smartphones, but also in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence of things, AR and VR, said Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center at Zhejiang University's International Business School.\nContact the writers at fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn\nCopyright 1995 -\n.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: Everything you need to know about the camera and tech showcase\nThe world's biggest technology show, CES 2024 is taking place in Las Vegas next week.\u00a0What camera kit will be there?\nCES 2024, the biggest technology event in the world, is taking place next week \u2013\u00a0and it's going to be the site of some huge announcements in the world of electronics.\nAs always (at least, when there's not a pandemic), CES 2024 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada and runs from January 09-12. Last year saw 117,000 visitors and 3,200 exhibitors at the event, including the biggest technology giants such as Google and Microsoft.\nOf specific interest to us, of course, are the imaging giants who are participating at this year's show: Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Adobe. While CES 2024 is a general technology showcase, not one dedicated to photography or videography in specific, it has been used as a launchpad for cameras and imaging tech. And with both video and AI being cornerstones of this year's event, we're sure to see some exciting launches.\nFull details on the show can be found at the CES website.\u00a0For now, here's what we're excited about and what we expect to see\u2026\nWhen is CES 2024?\nCES 2023 will take place in its traditional home of Las Vegas, Nevada, running from Tuesday January 09 to Friday January 12.\nThe event emanates from the Las Vegas Convention Center. If you're in the area, attendance details are on the CES website.\nWhat do we expect at CES 2024?\nSony\nWord has it that Sony could announce five cameras this year, among them the Sony A1 II, A7S IV, FX3 II and ZV-E10 II. With all of these featuring headline video capabilities, it would certainly be the right time and place to debut at the video-obsessed CES.\nPersonally I think it's waaaaaay too early for a Sony A1 successor, though with a new rumor that the company could replace the Sony A7S III (and the A7S line altogether) and the Sony FX3 with the FX3 II, this feels like a new pillar that would be well-cemented in Las Vegas.\nPanasonic\nThere's been plenty of chatter about replacements for the Panasonic S1 / S1R, Panasonic S1H and Panasonic GH6. And given that the company launched the Panasonic S5X and S5 IIX last January, it's entirely possible that an S1R II, S1H II and GH7 could be revealed at CES 2024.\nOf course, as a general tech giant, we could see plenty of other adjacent imaging breakthroughs. At last year's show Panasonic announced \"life changing\" smart glasses, made in conjunction with Biel Glasses, using AI to help users with impaired vision.\nHeck, maybe we might finally see Panasonic announce something 8K-related\u2026\nCanon\nWill CES 2024 be the launchpad for the highly anticipated Canon EOS R1? We all know that the new flagship is on the way, and that it's intended to launch in time for the Paris Olympics, so time is running out for Canon to show it to the world.\nThere are plenty of other possibilities, too. The Canon EOS R5 II feels a little ambitious, but Canon has a habit of showcasing its latest collection of concept cameras \u2013\u00a0many of which have made it to market, such as the Canon PowerShot Zoom and Canon PowerShot Pick. These are always fascinating glimpses into the future, and I'm excited to see what's on show this year!\nNikon\nAfter a knockout year in 2023, Nikon could capitalize by taking the bull by the horns early in 2024. The likeliest candidate to me would be the Nikon Z6 III, which is widely expected to be here any minute.\nThere has also been a wild rumor about a Nikon Z9H \u2013\u00a0a speed-oriented version of the Nikon Z9. The \"H\" is ostensibly a nod to the suffix Nikon used to give to its flagship cameras to denote particular performance specialisms \u2013\u00a0such as the Nikon D1H, which was a speed-oriented upgrade of the base D1.\u00a0Personally I'll believe this one when I see it!\nFujifilm\nThis feels like a bit of a long shot, as Fujifilm is usually more at home announcing products on its home turf at CP+. That said, with reports that the manufacturer will launch more cameras in January alone than it did in 2023 as a whole, a launch or announcement isn't out of the question.\nWhat could this be? Well, a follow-up to the Fujifilm X100V is widely expected \u2013 and given what a blockbuster success that camera was, it could be a good fit for the broader-appeal of CES 2024. An outside chance would be the Instax Mini 99, which sounds like it might be a disruptive product.\nCES 2024 announcements\nLaCie Rugged Mini SSD\nThe palm-sized LaCie Rugged Mini SSD has been announced in capacities up to 4TB offering IP54 dust and rain resistance, 3-meter drop protection and 1-ton car pressure resistance.\u00a0No need to baby your portable SSD any more!\nLaCie claims write speeds of up to 2000MB/s, with USB 3.2 gen 2x2 and compatibility with USB 40Gbps, USB 10Gps, Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts including the latest Apple iPad, iPhone and Macbooks. Prices start at $79.99 for 500GB and go up to $349.99 for 4TB.\nFull story: LaCie adds to its famous Rugged lineup with a new palm-sized SSD\nWith a good few days to go until the event kicks off, there will be plenty more news, announcements and leaks between now and doors opening. Stay tuned to this page where we'll keep you updated with all the launches as they happen!\nWe're expecting to see some of the best cameras for video and maybe even the best cameras for vlogging announced at the show, along with AI improvements to the best photo editing software and the best video editing software.\nThank you for reading 5 articles this month* Join now for unlimited access\nEnjoy your first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\n*Read 5 free articles per month without a subscription\nJoin now for unlimited access\nTry first month for just \u00a31 / $1 / \u20ac1\nGet the Digital Camera World Newsletter\nThe best camera deals, reviews, product advice, and unmissable photography news, direct to your inbox!\nThe editor of Digital Camera World, James has 21 years experience as a journalist and started working in the photographic industry in 2014 (as an assistant to Damian McGillicuddy, who succeeded David Bailey as Principal Photographer for Olympus).

The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.
