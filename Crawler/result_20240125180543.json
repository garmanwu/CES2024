The Chinese electronics giant showcased a range of impressive products, from its flagship ULED X TVs to groundbreaking Laser TV models and more. Hisense's CES 2024 focus was on delivering larger, brighter, and technologically advanced displays that are sure to make an impact in the market.\nHome Theater Review's Eric Walasek was in Las Vegas to provide an inside look and share captivating snapshots of Hisense's extraordinary CES 2024 offerings.\nOne of the highlights of Hisense's CES 2024 presentation was the introduction of the ULED X range, representing the pinnacle of the company's TV technology. The ULED X series encompasses several high-end models, with the 110UX leading the charge.\nThis behemoth of a TV boasts a jaw-dropping 40,000 backlighting zones and a staggering 10,000 nits of brightness. These impressive specs put it ahead of competitors, including TCL's latest 115-inch model, making it a standout in the 100-inch TV segment.\nSlightly smaller but still impressive, the 98UX features a 98-inch screen with a 144Hz refresh rate, more than 10,000 dimming zones, and 5,000 nits of brightness. Both the 110UX and 98UX come equipped with integrated 4.2.2 sound systems and offer compatibility with Dolby Atmos FlexConnect, allowing users to enjoy immersive sound without the need for external speakers or an AVR.\nHisense also showcased its thinnest Mini LED TV yet with the 75UX, measuring just 14 millimeters in depth. This slim design is described as an \"industry first,\" offering a combination of aesthetics and features. The TV boasts 5,000 dimming zones, promising unmatched contrast. Although it features a 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, it lacks Dolby Atmos FlexConnect support.\nHisense expanded its ULED lineup with new editions of the U6, U7, and U8 TVs. These models feature Mini LED backlights, offering up to 3,000 nits of brightness and support for Dolby Vision and IMAX Enhanced. Gamers will appreciate the 144Hz gaming support over HDMI 2.1 and Auto Low Latency Mode (ALLM). The U7 and U8 series also receive exclusive features powered by the Hi-View Engine Pro chipset, including Dynamic Tone Mapping Pro and AI HDR and detail enhancement modes.\nIn a unique addition to its TV lineup, Hisense unveiled the CanvasTV, a direct competitor to Samsung's The Frame TV. This TV seamlessly blends into its surroundings, thanks to its frame-style wood housing and zero-gap wall mount, combining technology with artistry to create a visually pleasing home entertainment solution.\nHisense's focus on Laser TV technology was evident in its CES 2024 presentation. The company revealed several high-end models, including the flagship 8K Sonic Screen Laser TV. This groundbreaking projector delivers 8K resolution while using the screen itself to emit cinematic sound. With over 100,000 sound units, it promises an immersive audio-visual experience.\nThe Rollable Laser TV is another innovative addition to Hisense's CES 2024 lineup, featuring an integrated ultra-short throw projector and an ambient light-rejecting screen that unfurls when in use. This design offers flexibility and convenience for users.\nThe Ultra Slim 4K Laser TV, boasting a depth of just 1.57cm and a weight of only 7.5kg, positions itself as the smallest 4K Laser TV in the industry. Powered by Hisense's Compact Laser Engine and Ultra Slim Display Technology, it offers a sleek and lightweight viewing solution.\nAddressing one of the biggest criticisms of projectors, Hisense unveiled the Ultra Black Screen Laser 4K. This Laser TV incorporates micro-nano anti-glare film technology, improving light usage efficiency by 50%. Hisense also collaborated with Barco to create the Dynamic Light Steering Laser TV, which uses Barco's Bright technology to deliver superior image quality regardless of the lighting conditions.\nPricing and availability for these new TVs and Laser TVs are yet to be revealed, but Hisense's CES 2024 lineup promises to bring a range of exciting options for consumers seeking larger, brighter, and more technologically advanced displays.\nRelated posts:\nSubscribe To Home Theater Review\nRecent\nTrending\nAdvertise with UsCustomer Support Editorial Policy Award Licensing"

Hisense's newest lineup pushes the boundaries of picture quality, offering even more immersive big-screen options and delivering lifelike visuals that redefine home entertainment in its commitment to setting new standards of display technology to make cutting-edge innovations accessible. This year, the brand takes this even further with the introduction of its latest ULED lineup and two new ULED X models \u2014 98UX and 110UX, further cementing its position to deliver the most innovative technology at an exceptional value.\n\"Hisense's groundbreaking ULED and ULED X products have the potential to revolutionize the home entertainment landscape where stunning picture quality, mesmerizing big-screen immersion, and inspiring visuals take center stage,\" said David Gold, President of Hisense Americas. \"Always at the forefront of innovation, Hisense empowers all consumers with solutions that anticipate their unique preferences and lifestyles, providing an unparalleled and unforgettable entertainment experience.\"\n98UX: Redefining Picture Quality\n2023 represented a seismic shift in the capabilities of Mini LED TVs with the introduction of Hisense's ULED X \u2014 the pinnacle of LED picture quality technology. Its sheer power in brightness, precision in dimming control, and audio prowess left an indelible mark, setting a new benchmark for LED TVs. This year, Hisense pushes the limits even further with two new additions to the ULED X family with the 110UX and 98UX, Mini LED TVs that once again redefines what's possible in the realm of picture quality.\n98UX transcends its predecessor with remarkable enhancements making it bigger, brighter, and faster. Boasting an increased peak brightness scaling up to an impressive 5,000 nits \u2014 nearly double that of last year's model and even more depth, detail and contrast with over 10,000 local dimming zones, the 98UX brings extraordinary picture quality and realism to full display on a massive 98-inch screen.

Featuring over 40,000 backlight zones on its expansive 110-inch screen, the 110UX's design virtually eliminates blooming and elevates contrast through high-output Mini LED technology, reaching an unparalleled brightness of up to 10,000 nits. Notably, the 110UX Series redefines industry standards with unparalleled enhancements to contrast and dynamic range, covering 95% of the BT.2020 color palette \u2014 compared to other leading displays that achieve only 80%.\nWith cutting-edge color-resistant panel materials, QLED-Quantum Dot technology, and the groundbreaking Hi-View Engine X chipset driven by AI, this pinnacle of engineering introduces intelligent features like AI contrast and AI depth.

Consumer electronics giant Hisense is holding its own press conference this year, starting on January 8 at 12PM ET.

The company says it\u2019ll \u201cshowcase a range of groundbreaking innovations that redefine the way we interact with screens,\u201d with the official tagline being \"See. Connect.

David Gold, President of Hisense Americas, is hosting the event and the company promises TVs that offer \u201cunparalleled clarity and contrast, transforming living rooms into cinematic havens.\u201d We could all use some more havens, cinematic or not.\nThe press conference won\u2019t just be TVs, however, as Hisense is a multi-faceted company with a stake in many market segments.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Hisense and TCL Go Big (and Super Bright) With Competing 4K TVs\nThe two TV manufacturers battle it out to offer the biggest and brightest with the 100-inch, 10,000-nit Hisense 110UX and the 115-inch, 5,000-nit TCL QM891G.\nI\u2019ve been PCMag\u2019s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I\u2019ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade. I\u2019m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I\u2019m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don\u2019t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).\nLAS VEGAS\u2014Hisense and TCL are eschewing gimmicks like 8K resolution and wireless OLED panels to focus on making the biggest and brightest 4K TVs possible. At CES, both companies introduced models that push the limits of what we've seen in screen size and light output.\nTCL's newest extra-large flagship TV, the Q Class QM891G, is a 115-inch LED screen with 20,000 mini-LED dimming zones that can output up to 5,000 nits. It has a 6.2.2-channel built-in speaker system with up-firing drivers for Dolby Atmos spatial audio, a 120Hz panel with support for 144Hz variable refresh rate, Wi-Fi 6, and an ATSC 3.0 tuner for 1080p and 4K over-the-air broadcasts.\nThe 110-inch Hisense 110UX isn't quite as big as the QM891G, but according to the manufacturer its 40,000-zone mini-LED backlight system can put out up to 10,000 nits. It features a 4.2.2-channel speaker system, a 144Hz native refresh rate, Wi-Fi 6E, and an ATSC 3.0 tuner.\nIf the stated peak brightness levels are accurate, the QM891G and 110UX will be the brightest consumer TVs ever offered by far. For reference, the brightest TV we've reviewed, the Editors' Choice Hisense U8K, put out 2,114 nits in our tests, and only a handful have even come close to the 2,000-nit mark. We perform these tests by measuring the light output of a white square that takes up 18% of the total screen area, ensuring consistency across all TVs that come into the lab. Even when we shrink the square to 10% to see if any more brightness can be eked out (seldom an issue with LED TVs but often the case with OLED panels), nothing comes close to even 3,000 nits. In other words, Hisense and TCL's new high-end TVs are really, really bright.\nThey aren't the only potentially blinding TVs the two companies announced, though. TCL's QM851G is similar to the QM891G in peak brightness (up to 5,000 nits) with up to 5,000 mini-LED dimming zones, and screen sizes available in 65, 75, 85, and 98 inches. Hisense also unveiled the 98-inch 98US, which boasts a 10,000-zone, 5,000-nit mini-LED backlight array like the QM891G and QM851G. The latest iteration of the U8 series, meanwhile, can put out up to 3,000 nits, well exceeding last year's model.\nDon't expect these TVs to actually look many times brighter than the brightest TVs currently on the market, though. While light is measured in consistent units like nits and lumens, the human eye perceives light output on a curve. We notice changes in light much more when there's less light, like the difference between 10 nits and 100 nits, than we do when there's more, like between 1,000 nits and 10,000 nits. The 10,000-nit screen will certainly look brighter, but we don't really see it as literally 10 times brighter, just \"much brighter.\" High dynamic range (HDR) content is usually mastered for 1,000 or 10,000 nits, with the former being close to an average of HDR-capable TVs and the latter being the peak of current HDR standards. Each TV then adjusts that mastery to what it's actually capable of by applying its own curve or using tone mapping.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nHisense and TCL are known for offering inexpensive TVs, but the pricing and availability for their new models haven't yet been announced. The QM89G and 110UX will likely be a few thousand dollars each, but still probably less than similar LG and Samsung TVs.\nHisense also announced a presumably (and relatively) budget-priced 100-inch TV in the 10076N. Its peak brightness was not revealed, but it features a 144Hz refresh rate and Wi-Fi 6E. For more budget options, Hisense announced the U6N and U7N models, while TCL unveiled the S551G, Q651G, and QM751G lines. Neither company specified the feature differences between the tiers.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.
