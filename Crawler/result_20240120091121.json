Sichuan Changhong Electric Co. (Changhong), a leading supplier of consumer electronics in Asia, has collaborated with Analog Devices Inc. (ADI), a global leader in designing and manufacturing semiconductor products and solutions and Consumer Physics, Inc. to integrate breakthrough SCiO material sensing technology into mobile phones. Launching in 2017, Changhong H2 and its advanced molecular material sensing and identification technology will, for the first time in human history, allow consumers to scan material and immediately receive actionable insights based on its underlying chemical composition, exploring their physical surroundings as never before.\n\u201cThe Changhong H2 is a remarkable device with unique capabilities that we are excited to add to our growing portfolio of connected and IoT-enabled devices,\u201d said Mr. Jin Li, President, Sichuan Changhong Electronics Holding Group Co., Ltd. \u201cAlong with ADI and Consumer Physics, we look forward to bringing the Changhong H2 to the world and inspiring curious thinkers around the world to explore their surroundings in a new and revolutionary way. We also look forward to working closely with third party developers via an SDK that they can use to develop their own applications for the Changhong H2 smartphone.\u201d\nChanghong has worked closely with Consumer Physics and ADI to develop and manufacture this first-of-its-kind smartphone. Since collaborating in early 2016, ADI and Consumer Physics have been committed to miniaturizing the SCiO sensor for integration into a wide variety of connected devices.\n\u201cEach year, the Internet of Things continues to grow and the profound impact of smart, connected devices is felt more and more in our daily lives,\u201d said Martin Cotter, Senior Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Digital Marketing, Analog Devices. \u201cChanghong H2, with the integrated, miniaturized near-infrared spectrometer, marks a huge step forward for connected devices and makes it possible to see the physical world around us like never before via a mobile phone, which is the most common smart device in the world.\u201d\nUsing Changhong H2, consumers can analyze the properties of foods, liquids, medication, body metrics, and much more. This will give consumers new ways to improve their personal wellness, select the best fruits and vegetables, stick to their diets and nutritional needs, and verify product authenticity in ways never before thought possible. Changhong is also working to create a broad eco-system of mobile applications that utilize the SCiO sensor for a wide range of use cases.\nEverything in the world is comprised of molecules and, theoretically, the H2 smartphone can be used on almost any material. It\u2019s a smartphone that creates miracles. From identification of compositions like alcoholic drinks, to process control \u2013 with the right apps and corresponding database, it can create experiences beyond our imagination.\n\u201cJust as the smartphone put the power of the internet and a vast knowledge base into our pockets, this innovation will put the capability to learn about the chemical and molecular makeup of materials into the public\u2019s hands,\u201d said Dror Sharon, CEO of Consumer Physics. \u201cThis is the next leap forward not just for mobile phones, but for all sorts of connected devices. The Changhong H2 and smartphones are only the beginning.\u201d\nChanghong H2 is a revolutionary new entrant into the mobile phone market, with exclusive functionality that no other smartphone can match. Similar to the integration of cameras and GPS chips, the integration of the SCiO sensor into the mobile phone represents a sea change in terms of the device\u2019s capability to enhance our daily lives. Compared to regular smartphones, the Changhong H2 is 20% more energy efficient. It boasts a unique 6-inch extra-large high-resolution screen and a seamless user experience with 2.0GHz/8-core CPU.\nChanghong H2 will be on display at the Changhong booth number 11539 in the Central Hall, where an unveiling event will be held on Friday, January 6th, at 11:30am.\nA press kit with images, logos, and more information can be found at https://www.consumerphysics.com/H2PressKit.zip\nFor more information in China, please visit: http://mobile.changhong.com/products/fun/H2, and if outside of China, please visit http://phone.consumerphysics.com and follow #H2CES.\nAbout Sichuan Changhong Electric Co., Ltd.\nEstablished in 1958, Changhong has been the top manufacturer of TVs in the Chinese market for 18 consecutive years.

Ask them about other sensitive information, like contracts, financial documents, and source code, and you\u2019ll probably get a much less confident response. Few organizations have any insight into business-critical information stored in unstructured data. There was a time when that didn\u2019t matter. Those days are gone. Data is now accessible, copious, and dispersed, and it includes an alarming amount of business-critical information. It\u2019s a target for both cybercriminals and regulators but securing it is incredibly difficult. It\u2019s the data challenge of our generation. Existing approaches aren\u2019t doing the job. Keyword searches produce a bewildering array of possibly relevant documents that may or may not be business critical. Asking users to categorize documents requires extensive training and constant vigilance to make sure users are doing their part. What\u2019s needed is an autonomous solution that can find and assess risk so you can secure your unstructured data wherever it lives. That\u2019s our mission. Concentric\u2019s semantic intelligence solution reveals the meaning in your structured and unstructured data so you can fight off data loss and meet compliance and privacy mandates.\nThreatConnect provides a suite of risk quantification, threat intelligence, orchestration and automation capabilities for security executives and the threat intelligence, security operations and incident response teams that work for them to share a single source of truth.

Buy a feed or three, suck them into your SIEM, automate blocking IOCs, and check the box. And in many ways, that addresses a sizable chunk of the tactical and operational value of threat intel. However, a growing number of organizations are realizing that threat intel can also inform strategy: how and why we train our users, where we should be investing our security resources, and what kinds of conversations executive leadership should actually be having to avoid becoming the latest cautionary tale used to sell more feeds.
