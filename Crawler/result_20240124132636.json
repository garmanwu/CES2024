Branded as Korea's first 'Korean Silicon Valley,' it supports early-stage startups in their validation, investment, and entry into the global market. Significantly expanding extensive support for international expos and exhibitions has yielded remarkable results.\nIFEZ, positioning Incheon Startup Park as a prime startup support space domestically, allocated additional funding this year to support the participation of 30 companies at CES 2024. Among these, 16 companies received approval for participation from the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), the organizing entity. These companies are set to showcase their exhibits at Eureka Park, the national startup pavilion.\nSimultaneously, IFEZ plans to operate a 1423.33-square-feet 'Incheon/IFEZ Promotion Hall' at the main exhibition hall, Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC), in the AI & Robotics Zone. Through this exclusive promotional space, they aim to advertise products and technologies from 34 startups nationwide, conduct global media stage online briefings, and widely publicize the achievements of each company.\nRegarding the motivation behind supporting a significant presence of Korean startups at CES, Shim Sunok, Director of Smart City at IFEZ, stated, \"Presenting Incheon's smart city technological prowess at the world's largest expo is not only crucial but also crucial to establishing our city's international competitive recognition.\" Further, she explained, \"We aim to promote the innovative technologies fostered in Incheon, paving the way for global expansion.\"\nAmong the startups participating through the Incheon Startup Park support program at CES this year, nine impressive companies were honored with 11 awards, including one Best of Innovation Award and ten Innovation Award Honorees.

Equipped with motion sensors, this wearable airbag instantly inflates within 0.2 seconds upon detecting an operator's accident, protecting vulnerable areas from serious injury.\nSheco (CEO Kwon Ki-seong) was acknowledged as the Honoree in the Drones & Unmanned Systems category and Human Security for All category for its 'Sheco ARC-M' platform, integrating underwater drones and crewless movement systems. This platform's purification solution incorporates real-time contamination separation technology, ensuring immediate and efficient water quality purification.\nTheLittleCat (CEO Kim Dae-yong) secured an Innovation Award Honoree in the Digital Health category with its 'InPet (INPET)' platform, centered around monitoring the composition of companion animal bodies. Collecting and acquiring eight different physiological data points using patented sensors and systems and providing users with intuitive smartphone app-based analytical results aids in preventing increasing obesity and other complications among companion animals.\nVerses (CEO Lee Seong-wook) received recognition as the Honoree in the AI category for its 'Beat-based AI Music Video Generator.' Using generative AI, its software links multiple music and video sources to an interaction engine, presenting users with different music and video outputs based on their actions, enabling the creation of natural short-form music videos without needing separate tools.\nKim Jin-yong, IFEZ Commissioner, emphasized, \"The accolades at CES signify that numerous domestic startups have proven their global standard innovation.\" He further determined, stating, \"We will continue actively supporting Incheon companies in their leap to becoming global enterprises through CES participation and related support initiatives.\"\nThe Consumer Technology Association (CTA) organizes CES, the world's largest IT exhibition, in Las Vegas every January.

        "raw_content": "Thumbnail by AVING News\nSEOUL, South Korea, Jan. 3, 2024 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0A news report from AVING Global:\nOn December 12th, an 'Incheon Special Global Press Conference' occurred at the Incheon Startup Park in Songdo, Incheon.\nThis global press conference was organized as a promotional event for local startups participating in the CES 2024, the world's largest IT and consumer electronics exhibition, to introduce their capabilities to the global media through the support programs provided by the Incheon Startup Park.\nLeading this initiative, the Incheon Economic Free Zone Authority (IFEZ) was established in 2003 to develop Incheon into an international economic hub and a center for specialized services. Forming a free economic zone centered around Incheon, IFEZ has been contributing to the city's development and growth and furthering the national economy. In February 2021, they opened the Incheon Startup Park, positioning it as the 'nursery of startups.'\nQ1: Please introduce IFEZ, responsible for the leap to a global smart city in Incheon.\nA: Director Shim Sunok: Understanding the 'Korean Free Economic Zones' is crucial. 'KFEZ' refers to special economic zones formed to improve the business environment and living conditions for foreign-invested companies by relaxing various regulations to maximize their financial autonomy and attract investment.\nIncheon, possessing international harbors and airports, took on this role in 2003, giving birth to the Incheon Economic Free Zone Authority. For 20 years, IFEZ has selected seven future visions such as a Life Science and healthcare City, a Global Education City, a Future Smart City, a K-Contents City, a Startup Venture Polis, an International Financial City, and a Tourism and leisure Hub City, aiming to make Incheon a 'first-class city' recognized worldwide, not just in South Korea.\nQ2: IFEZ exudes remarkable confidence and pride in Incheon as a smart city. What is the background for this?\nA: Director Shim Sunok: IFEZ has been the leading force in transforming Songdo, Yeongjong, and Cheongra\u2014three city zones\u2014into intelligent cities over the past 20 years. Songdo International City is a global hub for advanced knowledge and service industries with facilities like international business districts, knowledge information industrial complexes, and bio-clusters.\nMoreover, Yeongjong International City is optimized for logistics and tourism industries with world-class airport facilities. Cheongra International City embodies a new concept of business towns coexisting with business and residential spaces.\nIFEZ aims to establish an international-scale advanced service industry hub under the 'Global Business Frontier' vision and continue expanding its influence.\nQ3: IFEZ announced support for local startups' participation in CES 2024 under the global smart city strategy. What is the connection between startups' global stage entry and smart city capabilities?\nA: Director Shim Sunok: We believe there is no better place than CES to showcase Incheon's smart city technological prowess to the world. CES, the world's largest IT exhibition, attracts over 150,000 attendees annually.\nOur goal is to imprint Incheon as a city with international competitiveness in the minds of people gathered on this global stage. The technology and systems constituting our city originate from the ideas of innovation companies and startups nurtured by Incheon. If we can demonstrate these in the competitive arena of global tech companies, it validates our competitiveness and fulfills our goal.\nMoreover, this is a pivotal platform for startups with limited opportunities for global market expansion compared to established corporations. 'Bursys,' an Incheon company that participated in CES 2023, is a good example. It received significant attention after its participation and winning the Best Innovation Award. It even received serious proposals from 'Warner Bros,' a content production company, and is collaborating with the metaverse platform 'ZEPETO,' boasting 200 million users worldwide.\nIFEZ believes in the potential for future startups to become the next supernova after 'Verses.' Our role is to support them to translate their potential into tangible results. Hence, we started supporting startups' participation in CES this year.\nFurthermore, IFEZ plans to operate an 'Incheon/IFEZ Promotion Pavilion within the Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) during the exhibition, showcasing products from 34 startups and enhancing Incheon's bright city image. LVCC is a hub during CES, utilizing the entire city area. As the only local government operating a joint pavilion here, we expect a substantial promotional impact.\nQ4: I'm curious about the companies IFEZ and Incheon Startup Park supported for CES 2024 participation and their achievements before the exhibition.\nA: Director Shim Sunok: Out of the 30 startups IFEZ and Incheon Startup Park supported for CES participation, 16 received final approval from the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) to enter Eureka Park. Though more companies couldn't make the list, considering it's the first attempt, it's a decent outcome.\nSignificantly, more than half of the participating startups, 9 out of 16, swept 11 innovation awards at CES 2024. As known, CES Innovation Awards are granted to products and technologies showcasing differentiation and market potential before the exhibition, translating to global market opportunities.\nLast year's Best Innovation Award winner, 'Verses,' consecutively won the award with their 'Bit-based AI Music Video Generator.' 'Lordsystem,' presenting the 'Trip Pass Mobile Passport Platform,' won the Best Innovation Award in the financial technology category and the Cybersecurity & Personal Safety category, achieving double victories.\nSimilarly, startups like 'Sheco,' dual winners of the Innovation Award, and 'TheLittleCat,' 'Safeware,' 'Microsystems,' 'BANF,' 'Gole Robotics,' and 'K-Rangers (OhMyApp),' each winning in a category, will shine at Eureka Park during the exhibition.\nQ5: What are the future directions and plans of IFEZ post-CES 2024\nA: Director Shim Sunok: IFEZ aims to expand Smart City Incheon's influence overseas continually. To achieve this, it plans to participate consistently in globally recognized mega exhibitions such as Germany's IFA (Internationale FunkAusstellung) and Spain's MWC (Mobile World Congress) to maximize promotional effects. Especially, CES marks the first step in overseas-oriented promotional activities, and we will do our utmost to reap the maximum outcome.\nMoreover, while based in Incheon, the authority will continue discovering companies and startups with exceptional capabilities and potential, offering them more opportunities. The dream is to realize symbiotic growth between corporations and the city, paving the way for future developments.\n#incheon, #ifez, #Incheon Seutateueop Park, #ccei.creativekorea.incheon\n1.

        "raw_content": "Contents\nIncheon Free Economic Zone\nThe Incheon Free Economic Zone (IFEZ), located in Incheon, South Korea is a Korean Free Economic Zone that consists of the three regions of Songdo, Cheongna, and the island of Yeongjong and has a total area of 51,739 acres (209.38\u00a0km2).[1] The goal of the IFEZ is to transform these three areas into hubs for logistics, international business, leisure, and tourism for the Northeast Asian region. Incheon's Free Economic Zone was officially designated by the Korean government in August 2003.[2][3]\nIFEZ is planned to be a self-contained living and business district featuring air and sea transportation, a logistics complex, an international business center, financial services, residences, schools and hospitals, and shopping and entertainment centres.\nPurpose[edit]\nThe Incheon Free Economic Zone (IFEZ) was established with the intent of its becoming one of the future top three economic zones in the world.[4]\nThe time period for the Infrastructure Development stage was from 2003 to 2009, and the time period for the Project Development stage was from 2010 to 2014.[4]\nThe final stage is expected to be completed by 2020.[4] The first stage is for building infrastructures, and the second stage is for \"expanding the infrastructure for education, health, and leisure, and attracting domestic and international businesses\" [4] The final stage is to realize the goal of the project of building a top three economic zone in the world.[4]\nInvestment incentives[edit]\nIn order to attract many domestic and international businesses, three types of incentives are given: tax reductions, estate support, and subsidies.[5] No taxes are levied on corporate and individual income for few years.[5]\nThe regional government does not impose the acquisition tax over 15 years and the property tax over 10 years.[5]\nAfter 10 years of operation without any property tax levied, the business entities are imposed only 50% of the property taxes for three years.[5] The period of corporate and individual income tax levied by the national government varies by the size and the types of the business moving into the district.[5]\nNew Songdo City[edit]\nSongdo International City began development in 1994 and is being built on reclaimed land. It is designated to become a center of businesses, a hub for international trade, an area for knowledge-based technologies, and a place for living.\nIn August 2009, Incheon hosted the Global Fair & Festival 2009 Incheon, Korea in the New Songdo City for a period of 80 days.\nInternational Business District[edit]\nThis project consists of the Songdo Convencia convention centre, the North East Asia Trade Tower (NEATT), many office buildings, and a Jack Nicklaus Golf Course on 1,364 acres (5.52\u00a0km2). The projected budget is approximately 22 billion dollars. The developer is NSIC, a joint venture company between GALE and POSCO.\nSongdo Convencia was under construction since March 2005 and was completed by early 2009. It is Songdo's first LEED certified project.\nNEATT has been under construction since February 2007, and the first phase will be finished by the end of 2009. It will contain 65 stories to a height of approximately 300 meters. A central park is also under construction that will be 10% the size of Songdo International City. It will contain a museum, a botanical garden, an artificial lake and was scheduled to open in June 2009.\nIncheon Tower[edit]\nIncheon Tower will be located in Construction Area 11. It is proposed 151-floor, 610 meter tower but the Incheon government cancelled the plan due to financial problems.\nIncheon Bridge[edit]\nIncheon Bridge is a 12.3\u00a0km (7.6\u00a0mi) long bridge that connects Songdo International City and Yeongjong Island. Construction was completed in 2009\nIncheon International Hospital[edit]\nIncheon will have a hospital in its new Songdo City complex in 2014.\nAccording to the MOU, the hospital with 600 beds will be the first profit-making medical institute in Korea, with a sizable foreign investment. It is estimated to cost 400 billion won.\nThe hospital will be built on an 80,000 square-meter site, and construction will be completed by late 2016.\nYeongjong Island[edit]\nYeongjong International City\u2019s 34,183 acres (138.33\u00a0km2) centering on the Incheon International Airport will be developed as an eco-friendly airport city by 2020. It will be a functional city with residential amenities for airport staff and visitors, as well as logistics, commercial and distribution facilities. Yeongjong will provide an optimal environment for logistic, tourism and leisure in conjunction with the Incheon International Airport.\nCheongna[edit]\nThe Cheongna district, on the mainland adjacent Yeongjong Island, will focus on entertainment and will feature a world class theme park.\nIt will also be a residential area with sports facilities, a floriculture complex, and a business area specially designed for international finance.\nReferences[edit]"

Here's what that means downstream\nScientists are studying the evolution of Emmons Glacier and its implications on watersheds throughout the Pacific Northwest.\nUniversity of Washington Faculty Dr. Michelle Koutnik inspects the terminus of the Emmons glacier under Little Tahoma Peak. (Nick Danielson for Crosscut)\nDr. Claire Todd walked down loose volcanic rock into a steep valley where the Emmons glacier once stretched into Mount Rainier National Park. She, along with a team of her geology students, then made a 1-mile trek to the end of the glacier, where an ice cave gushed water into the turbulent White River.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking down into the belly of the beast,\u201d said Todd, professor of geological sciences at California State University, San Bernardino. \u201cIt takes a lot of heat and melt to get this thing cranking for the season.\u201d\nGlaciers are essentially slow-moving rivers of ice and snow that hold water like a storage tank. During summer months, their melt flows into streams and rivers. Emmons \u2014 the largest glacier in the continental U.S. \u2014 is an important freshwater source for the Puget Sound, feeding into the White River that runs along state Route 410. Although Emmons grew in size each winter for decades, its surface is now melting irregularly, which raises questions about flooding and water supply as the climate warms.\nMore research is needed to understand what the future could bring, as well as climate policy to significantly lower greenhouse gases and slow climate change. The Inflation Recovery Act, recently passed in the U.S. Senate, is aimed in this direction, including a goal to cut carbon emissions by about 40% by 2030 and invest in clean energy sources.\nThis July, like every summer for the last 14 years, Todd hiked to Emmons to sample water quality and measure debris ranging from boulders of solidified lava to fragments of talus, or alpine rock.\u00a0Her fieldwork, currently funded by NASA and the University of Washington, allows for sampling that significantly adds to the information gathered through aerial mapping\nLeft: CSUSB Professor Claire Todd admires the terminus of the Emmons glacier in Mount Rainier National Park. Right: The headwaters of the White River flow out of the terminus of the Emmons glacier in Mount Rainier National Park. (Nick Danielson for Crosscut)\nUniversity of Washington faculty member Dr. Michelle Koutnik, University of Washington Tacoma faculty member Dr. Peter Selkin, and CSUSB Professor Claire Todd descend to White River in Mount Rainier National Park, Washington. The group visited Emmons, the largest glacier in the continental U.S., in July to sample water quality and measure debris. (Nick Danielson for Crosscut)\nWhen it melts, it pours\nTodd shares her findings with the National Park Service, the only government entity closely monitoring the glacier and analyzing changes.\u00a0National Park Service science technician Mike Larrabee and his team from the park service study Emmons\u2019 snowpack and how much of it has melted compared to past years to better track how the glacier feeds the White River. For the last 20 years, nearly 16% of the glacier\u2019s meltwater flowed into the river, which meanders along the northeast side of the mountain and serves as an unofficial border between King and Pierce counties. In low snowpack years, Larrabee\u2019s team measured as little as 7% of the melt flowing into the river.\nLike Todd, Larrabee travels on the glacier to take measurements. When setting out stakes for monitoring during the winter of 2014, Larrabee saw something unusual for the winter season: a deep channel in the snow.\n\u201cIt was like someone had taken a snowplow and just cut through there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was missing snow. The drainage network of the glacier was just spilling out and funneled down into the canyon, almost like a little stream channel.\u201d\nAt the lower end of the glacier, Larrabee found 64 million gallons of melted snow \u2014 enough water to fill 100 Olympic-size swimming pools.\nGlacial melt from the Emmons glacier creates the White River in Mount Rainier National Park. For the last 20 years, nearly 16% of the glacier\u2019s meltwater flowed into the river, which meanders along the northeast side of the mountain and serves as an unofficial border between King and Pierce counties. In low snowpack years, Larrabee\u2019s team measured as little as 7% of the melt flowing into the river. (Nick Danielson for Crosscut)\nScientists call this outburst flooding. This happens when glacier ice melts and abruptly releases water, which then flows downstream and temporarily overflows a river.\nThose floods are a normal summertime occurrence, but warmer years are increasing the likelihood for bigger ones. In November 2017, park technicians discovered another outburst flood when it tore out and destroyed monitoring equipment at the White River Bridge near a campground.\nThe surge of water and sediment usually stays within the park during an outburst flood, but huge flows could have impacts farther downstream at the Mud Mountain Dam, which holds back floods before they can reach nearby towns like Enumclaw.\nThe dam is essential for flooding control, according to Joanna Curran, a civil hydraulics engineer within the Army Corps of Engineers. Mud Mountain was created in the 1940s to manage heavy rain and snowmelt, when glacial outbursts didn\u2019t happen often.\nThe terminus of the Emmons glacier, covered in debris. (Nick Danielson for Crosscut)\nEmmons gets the least amount of sun compared to Mount Rainier\u2019s other 24 major glaciers. However, its growth is largely attributed to insulation from a 1963 rockfall from Little Tahoma Peak \u2014 a craggy, snowy wedge that rises 2,000 feet above Emmons.\nWhile layers of that rocky debris can protect the glacier from the sun, thin spots in its covering can also heat up the ice and accelerate melting. As a result, Emmons is retreating more quickly in the middle than its sides, leaving a horseshoe shape in its wake. As it steepens like a canyon, some areas are losing the rocks shading their ice from the sun. One lower section of the glacier shrunk by nearly 300 feet within just four years of shedding its rock cover.\nMore management adaptation may be needed to handle meltwater and the chunky sediment that comes with potential glacial outbursts, Curran said. As a possible solution, she is working with the United States Geological Survey to establish an early warning system that will notify dam managers and give them some time to adjust gates and valves to better control the fast-paced flood coming toward them.\n\u201cWe want to make sure it doesn\u2019t rip up the whole dam as it goes through so that we aren\u2019t putting anyone at risk downstream,\u201d Curran said.\nCurran said her engineering team is modeling the potential hazards, because their existing data doesn\u2019t give them a full picture of what would happen during an outburst flood.\nBased on observations from the 1980 Mount Saint Helens eruption, Curran said the dam would likely reduce damage from an extreme flood and keep residents who live downstream safe. While an outburst flood in India in 2021\u00a0caused a dam failure and killed people, that level of danger is not a factor here, according to Curran.\nFlooding is just one risk from melting glaciers like Emmons. When an outburst happens, the glacier loses water that can\u2019t be quickly replenished by snow or rain, and suddenly flooding is no longer the top concern. Water shortages are then the focus after an outburst because the waterways fed by the glacier\u2019s melt no longer receive the same dependable and sizable summer melt off.\nLeft: CSUSB student Diego Centeno measures glacier debris under the terminus of the Emmons glacier. Right: Centeno carries a yard stick on his pack so the group can measure glacial debris. (Nick Danielson for Crosscut)\nThe remains of a glacier in retreat\nIn the field with Todd, geology student Diego Centeno sat in front of the ice cave, using a two-prong ruler to measure rounded rocks that looked smooth enough to be found in the ocean \u2014 a stark difference from the rough volcanic debris around him.\nCenteno was looking to identify where the glacier retreated, a scientific description for when a glacier no longer extends down into a valley like it once did. This happens when a glacier is melting faster than it can accumulate snow and compress it into ice.\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the remains of a glacier,\u201d Centeno said. \u201cThe rounder the rock, we know erosion came through and whether the glacier moved.\u201d\nWhen in retreat, a glacier loses its cache of freshwater, a significant natural resource for the Puyallup and White rivers, which form a basin that collects rainfall and snowmelt. This area is one of the Puget Sound\u2019s biggest watersheds.\nCSUSB Professor Claire Todd and CSUSB student Diego Centeno inspect debris from the Emmons glacier while CSUSB student Jacob Baker calibrates a GPS unit. (Nick Danielson for Crosscut)\nWhen the snowpack is gone and precipitation is sparse in the summer, groundwater and glacial melt feed the streams, according to the Washington State Department of Ecology\u2019s latest water availability report.\u00a0With a high demand from a growing population, some areas in the watershed are experiencing a decline in groundwater levels and lower streamflows, creating the potential for water shortages in dry summers. The department has not \u201cfully realized\u201d the impacts of climate change in the watershed, according to the report, and the state does not have a long-term mitigation plan for glacier loss and drought implications.\nThat is in part because Western Washington\u2019s watersheds replenish each year from the winter\u2019s heavy rain, unlike the basins in the drier, eastern side of the state, said Jeff Marti, a drought coordinator with the ecology department.\nDrier conditions west of the Cascade Range combined with increasing glacial runoff have scientists scrambling for alternative solutions to problems that no longer appear far off in the future.\n\u201cWith climate change, the discussion tends to revolve around storage, because if the water is not going to stay high up in the watershed in the form of snow, then you need to find a way to detain it until it's needed,\u201d Marti said.\nStorage solutions could include new reservoirs. To avoid pouring concrete for new construction, water managers could turn to natural solutions like lakes. Meadows and wetlands could also stockpile water through their absorbent plants that can act like sponges.\nLittle Tahoma Peak, a sub-peak of Mount Rainier, sits above the Emmons glacier and White River. (Nick Danielson for Crosscut)\nWhat does it mean to save a glacier?\nIt will take combined scientific and political efforts to understand the evolution of the Emmons glacier and take meaningful action for its future. So far, many initiatives to protect glaciers are often superficial, said Mark Carey, director of University of Oregon\u2019s environmental studies program and its Glacier Lab. In his book \u201cIce Humanities,\u201d Carey unpacks various efforts to protect glaciers and explains why they fall flat. He points to European and Norwegian ski resorts that are blanketing areas of glaciers with tarps to try and deflect sunlight. It wouldn\u2019t be feasible to protect Mount Rainier the same way, because simply, it\u2019s too big, Carey said.\n\u201cIn terms of saving the glaciers, I continue to think very strongly that we need better climate policies,\u201d he said.\nLaws to protect glaciers may not be what states like Washington need, according to a study by his lab and five other universities which analyzed the effectiveness of international glacier protection policies. The best way forward, according to Carey, is local and global leaders taking political action to cut carbon emissions and slow climate change.\nIt\u2019s an effort that won\u2019t be resolved in the lifetimes of researchers like Dr. Claire Todd, but Emmons has something working in its favor, unlike other glaciers that have already disappeared. The monolithic glacier is nearly 4.3 square miles, roughly the size of downtown Seattle. Its size is buying scientists and decision-makers a little time for climate adaptation planning.\nHowever, Emmons\u2019 magnitude is a double-edged sword. Although the glacier\u2019s sweeping geography will likely prevent it from disappearing altogether anytime soon,\u00a0 it\u2019s harder to study and understand. But that is not deterring Todd in her relentless pursuit to figure out the glacier\u2019s uncertain future.\n\u201cFor Rainier, you think about when these glaciers are going to be gone,\u201d said Todd. \u201cI mean they are retreating. Gone? That\u2019s a long time away.\u201d\nDr. Michelle Koutnik and graduate student An Li hike above the terminus of the Emmons glacier under Mount Rainier.

Some of the best hikes in Mount Rainier National Park are short and sweet, offering jaw-dropping views with very little effort. But for those who crave more adventure or want to journey deep into the park, there are plenty of options.\nMount Rainier is one of our favorite US national parks for hiking. There is something almost magical about seeing Mount Rainier, especially your first time. This glacier-capped volcano can be seen for hundreds of miles, but to view it up close from hiking trails and overlooks in the park, it is extraordinary. From many of the trails, you get BIG views of Mount Rainier. Throw in some wildflowers, lakes, and waterfalls, and this park is a hiking paradise.\nAnd as far as hiking goes, this park truly offers something for everyone.\nIf you are not a big hiker or are traveling with young kids, there are easy-to-do 2 and 3 mile trails with stunning views of Mount Rainier. Several longer hikes weave around subalpine lakes and to viewpoints of Mount Rainier. And for those looking for an epic experience, you can hike up into the snowfields on Mount Rainier or hike part or all of the Wonderland Trail.\nIMPORTANT: In 2024, a portion of Stevens Canyon Road will be closed for a road construction project. Get the full details on the\u00a0National Park Service website.\nTIMED ENTRY RESERVATION: To enter the Sunrise and Paradise corridors between late May and early September, you will need a timed entry permit. Learn more on the National Park Service website.\nTable of Contents\nThese hikes are listed according to geographical area. There are four main regions to Mount Rainier National Park: Paradise, Sunrise, Ohanapecosh, and Carbon River.\nBelow is a map of the park from the National Park Service. I labeled the main areas of the park where most visitors will spend their time.\nHere are the best hikes in Mount Rainier National Park on a map. Note: all distances in this post are round trip.\nHow to Use This Map: Click the icons on the map to get more information about each point of interest. Click the star next to the title of the map to add this map to your Google Maps account. To view it on your phone or computer, open Google Maps, click the menu button, go to \u201cYour Places,\u201d click Maps, and you will see this map on your list.\nBest Hikes in Mount Rainier National Park\nHikes in the Paradise Area\nParadise is located on the southern slopes of Mount Rainier and it is one of the most heavily visited areas of the park. Numerous hiking trails are found here, including the spectacular Skyline Trail, and nearby, you can also hike to numerous lakes and waterfalls.\nDistance: 1.2 mile loop Difficulty: Easy Total Ascent: 200 feet Time: 45 minutes Trailhead: Lower Paradise parking lot\nThis easy, paved trail offers great views of Mount Rainier and the Nisqually Glacier. There a few short but steep climbs along the way but this trail is doable for most people. It\u2019s a nice option if you want views of Mount Rainier with minimal effort or will be pushing a stroller.\nNisqually Vista Trail\nDistance: 1 mile Difficulty: Easy Total Ascent: 100 feet Time: 30 minutes Trailhead: Upper Paradise Parking Lot\nIf you are looking for one easy-to-do hike in the Paradise area, look no further.\nStarting next to the Paradise Inn, you will walk the first part of the Skyline Trail. It is a paved path the entire way to Myrtle Falls, so this also makes a great hike for families with young kids and strollers.\nOnce you get to Edith Gorge, there are two viewpoints to visit. Take the short spur trail for a view of Myrtle Falls. It is a short but steep walk downhill to this viewpoint:\nOnce you are back on the Skyline Trail, turn right and walk about 100 feet. From here, you get a spectacular view of Mount Rainier with Edith Gorge.\nPRO TRAVEL TIP: There is not a whole lot to see beyond this point. The only reason to keep going is if you plan to hike the entire Skyline Trail (mentioned next). Beyond Myrtle Falls, the trail drops down into a valley and you lose the great views of Mount Rainier.\nDistance: 6.2 miles Difficulty: Strenuous Total Ascent: 1,900 feet Time: 3 to 5 hours Trailhead: Upper Paradise parking lot\nThis is one of the best hikes in Mount Rainier and an essential experience for those who love hiking.\nThe entire hike is a beauty. Starting in Paradise, you will hike past lovely Myrtle Falls, through pine forests, and then ascend the slopes of Mount Rainier. From Panorama Point, enjoy spectacular views over the park, and on a clear day you can see as far as Mount Hood in Oregon. Then it is a steep descent back to the Paradise Visitor Center.\nPanoramic view from the Skyline Trail\nYou can do this hike in either direction and both are great. We hiked it in both directions and based on our experience, it is equally awesome both ways.\nSnow will linger on the trail most of the hiking season, so it helps to bring hiking poles, and even a GPS device with maps, so you don\u2019t lose the trail.\nLEARN MORE: How to Hike the Skyline Trail to Panorama Point\nDistance: 8 miles Difficulty: Very strenuous Total Ascent: 4,800 feet Time: 8 to 10 hours Trailhead: Upper Paradise parking lot\nCamp Muir is as close as you can get to the summit of Mount Rainier without a climbing permit. To get to Camp Muir, you will hike the Skyline Trail to the Pebble Creek Trail. From here, it\u2019s a steep ascent up the mountain through the snow. To do this, you must have a good level of fitness. It is very challenging to hike in the snow and to make things even more difficult, by the time you make it to Camp Muir, you will be at an elevation of 10,188 feet.\nPebble Creek Trail to Camp Muir\nLearn more about hiking to Camp Muir here.\nDistance: 2.7 miles Difficulty: Moderate Total Ascent: 750 feet Time: 1.5 to 2.5 hours Trailhead: The trailhead is located on Stevens Canyon Road, 5 miles east of the Paradise visitor center. The trailhead is labeled as \u201cBench and Snow Lake Trail\u201d on Google Maps.\nOn one short hike you get to visit two subalpine lakes. The first part of the hike takes you to fields of wildflowers during the summer months. At 0.75 miles, take the spur trail out to Bench Lake. This trail cuts through a forest and you will walk through a tunnel that is carved out from the thick brush.\nFrom the shore of Bench Lake, you have a beautiful view of Mount Rainier.\nBench Lake\nBack on the main trail, it is a half mile walk, most of this uphill, to get to Snow Lake. Here is the view.\nSnow Lake\nHikes in the Sunrise Area\nSunrise is similar to Paradise, with amazing views of Mount Rainier and a multitude of hikes to choose from, depending on your activity level. It is located north of Mount Rainier.\nDistance: 3 miles Difficulty: Moderate Total Ascent: 500 feet Time: 1.5 to 2 hours Trailhead: Sunrise parking lot\nFrom the Sourdough Ridge Trail, you get amazing views of Mount Rainier National Park. This trail heads along the Sourdough Ridge and for almost the entire walk to Frozen Lake, Mount Rainier is sitting right in front of you.\nThis is a gorgeous walk in the Sunrise area and a must-do, even if you aren\u2019t a big fan of hiking.\nTo do this hike, start at the Sunrise parking lot. Hike up the Sunrise Nature Trail and then take the Sourdough Ridge Trail to the left. Be prepared for some seriously amazing views once you get to the top of the ridge. If you go all of the way to Frozen Lake, it is a 3-mile round trip hike. But you can turn around earlier if you like.\nFrom Frozen Lake, you can continue the journey by hiking one of the two following trails.\nDistance: 6 to 9 miles Difficulty: Strenuous Total Ascent: Up to 2,500 feet Time: 3 to 6 hours Trailhead: Sunrise parking lot\nThis hike starts with the 1.5 mile walk on the Sourdough Ridge Trail to Frozen Lake. At the trail junction (this is very clearly marked with trail signs), continue to the Burrough Mountains.\nAfter crossing a snowfield, you will hike up the Burroughs Mountains. Vegetation disappears as you hike through barren, rocky terrain. If you hike to the second Burrough Mountain, your hike is 6 miles round trip. If you continue to the third Burrough Mountain, your hike is now 9 miles round trip. But your reward is one of the best up-close views of Mount Rainier.\nLearn more here.\nDistance: 6 miles Difficulty: Moderate Total Ascent: 1,200 feet Time: 2.5 to 5 hours Trailhead: Sunrise parking lot\nIf you are looking for a hike that\u2019s not too long, not too difficult, and offers beautiful views of Mount Rainier, the Mount Fremont Fire Lookout is one to put on your to-do list.\nThis hike includes the Sourdough Ridge Trail to Frozen Lake, mentioned earlier. Beyond this point, the crowds thin out. It is a gradual uphill hike to the Mount Fremont Fire Lookout. Not only do you get dramatic views of Mount Rainier, but you also have panoramic views across the park.\nAs a bonus, there is an open air pit toilet that just may be one of the most unique bathroom experiences you will ever have.\nLEARN MORE:\u00a0 How to Hike the Mount Fremont Lookout Trail\nDistance: 12 miles Difficulty: Strenuous Total Ascent: 3,150 feet Time: 5 to 7 hours Trailhead: Sunrise Park Road, 4.3 miles from Mather Memorial Parkway and 11.2 miles from the Sunrise Visitor Center. The trailhead is labeled as \u201cSummerland Trail\u201d on Google Maps.\nHiking the Summerland Trail to Panhandle Gap is on the longer and more difficult side, but it has a little bit of everything\u2026old growth forests, fields of wildflowers, views of Mount Rainier, the chance to spot wildlife, high alpine views, and panoramic views out to Mount Adams.\nThis hike is located in the Sunrise area, just a short drive from the Sunrise visitor center.\nThe first half of the hike is a gradual uphill walk through old growth forests and fields of wildflowers. After one steep climb up a series of switchbacks, you emerge in Summerland. This is a beautiful area where the mountain slopes are covered with wildflowers and marmots scurry along the trail. You can turn around at this point, making the hike 9 miles round trip.\nSummerland\nHowever, if you keep going, you enter the subalpine region where the vegetation disappears, snow appears on the trail, and you hike past a frozen lake. The peak of Mount Rainier looms to your right.\nAfter one more big climb, you get panoramic views of the park and on a clear day, you can see Mount Adams.\nFinal climb to Panhandle Gap\nWe really enjoyed this hike and recommend it for those who like the idea of walking through a wide variety of terrain and want to leave the crowds behind.\nLEARN MORE:\u00a0 How to Hike the Summerland Trail to Panhandle Gap\nDistance: 3.6 miles Difficulty: Easy to moderate Total Ascent: 680 feet Time: 1.5 to 2.5 hours Trailhead: The largest parking lot is at the Tipsoo Comfort Station but from here you will do a little extra walking to get to the trailhead. There are also two parking areas on Highway 410, where the trail crosses the road. If you get here early, or are extremely lucky, you can park at one of the few spots right at the southern trailhead (this is where we parked): 46\u00b052\u201902.0\u2033N 121\u00b031\u201905.5\u2033W. You can also park at the very small parking lot at the northern trailhead on Highway 410: 46\u00b052\u201921.2\u2033N 121\u00b030\u201956.1\u2033W.\nWith wildflowers, views of Mount Rainier, and views of several very small but scenic lakes, this loop hike makes a great addition to your Mount Rainier hiking list. Half of the trail also includes a portion of the Pacific Crest Trail.\nThis hike is located on Highway 410 at the Chinook Pass.\nSince this is a loop, this hike can be done in either direction. From the small southern parking lot on Highway 410, next to Tipsoo Lake (GPS coordinates listed above), we did this hike counter-clockwise. The first section is on the PCT and goes through a forest. On this section of the hike, you occasionally have views of Mount Rainier but you will need to turn around for these views.\nAbout halfway through the loop, as you head back to Tipsoo Lake, the trees thin out and the views get better, in my opinion. You will walk past a small lake, cross Highway 410 on a wooden pedestrian bridge, and then drop down to Tipsoo Lake.\nHikes in Ohanapecosh\nIn Ohanapecosh, which is on the southeastern corner of the park, you are tucked away in the ancient forests. A visit here isn\u2019t so much about big views of Mount Rainier. Instead, you can walk through forests of trees that are hundreds of years old.\nDistance: 1.5 miles Difficulty: Easy Total Ascent: Minimal Time: 1 hour Trailhead: On Stevens Canyon Road next to the Stevens Canyon entrance. It is labeled \u201cGrove of the Patriarchs Trail\u201d on Google Maps. The parking lot has space for about 20 cars. It can be challenging to get a parking space here midday during the summer months.\nIMPORTANT: The Grove of the Patriarchs Trail is closed due to damage to the suspension bridge from flooding. Get updates on the National Park Service website.\nWalking through the Grove of the Patriarchs is an essential hike if it is your first visit to Mount Rainier National Park.\nThis easy, 1.5-mile walking trail takes you past some of the largest and oldest trees in Mount Rainier National Park. These ancient Douglas firs, western red cedars, and western hemlocks are enormous. You will cross a suspension bridge and then walk on a series of boardwalk and dirt trails through the forest.\nDistance: 3.4 miles Difficulty: Easy Total Ascent: 670 feet Time: 1.5 to 3 hours Trailhead: Since this is a loop, there are several trailheads. The best place to park is at the Ohanapecosh Visitor Center. See our hiking post for more details.\nThe Silver Falls Loop Trail is a wonderful short hike in Mount Rainier National Park. What it lacks in views of Mount Rainier it makes up for in its easy walkability and breathtaking views of Silver Falls.\nSilver Falls\nOhanapecosh River\nThis short, easy trail is perfect for all ages and ability levels. Less than 4 miles in length, with just a small amount of elevation gain, it\u2019s a great hike for families and people of all ages.\nThis hike beat all of our expectations. For the entire hike, you are in an old growth forest. The trail weaves between the old, giant trees but the highlight is the view of Silver Falls. From various overlooks and bridges, you are treated to views of the waterfall and the moss-covered rocks along the river\u2019s edge.\nThis is one of the best hikes in Mount Rainier National Park if you are here on a cloudy or rainy day.\nLEARN MORE:\u00a0 How to Hike the Silver Falls Loop\nHikes in Carbon River\nCarbon River is located in the northwestern quadrant of Mount Rainier National Park. It is more remote than the other sections, so if you like the idea of hiking a quieter trail, it\u2019s worth the extra time to get here.\nBoth of the hikes listed below are located on Mountain Meadows Road. This is a 17-mile gravel road that is rough in some spots. However, you do not need a 4\u00d74 for this road. It is suitable for standard cars. This road opens in June or July, depending on snowfall, and then closes in October or November.\nDistance: 8 miles Difficulty: Strenuous Total Ascent: 1,800 feet Time: 4 to 6 hours Trailhead: The end of Mountain Meadows Road\nThis is one of the best hikes in Mount Rainier if you want to see wildflowers.\nThe hike starts out in forest. Beyond the spur trail to Spray Falls, it is a tough climb. Once at the top, you leave many of the trees behind and begin your walk through fields of wildflowers. To make the experience even better, you get stunning views of Observation Rock, Echo Rock, and Mount Rainier.\nDistance: 5.6 miles Difficulty: Moderate to strenuous Total Ascent: 1,600 feet Time: 2.5 to 4 hours Trailhead: Tolmie Peak Trailhead is located on Mountain Meadows Road.\nWith low crowds and dramatic views of Mount Rainier, this is one of our favorite hikes in the park.\nThis fun hike takes you through dense forests and past several alpine lakes before delivering you to the Tolmie Peak Lookout, for a spectacular view of Mount Rainier.\nLEARN MORE: How to Hike to the Tolmie Peak Fire Lookout\nThe Wonderland Trail\nDistance: 93 miles Difficulty: Strenuous Total Ascent: Over 23,000 feet Time: 9 to 13 days\nThe Wonderland Trail is a 93-mile trail that circumnavigates around Mount Rainier. Not only is this one of the best experiences in the park, hiking the Wonderland Trail is one of the top backpacking trips in the USA.\nAlong the hike, you will cross rivers and streams, walk through canyons and temperate forests, and get to see Mount Rainier from all angles. It\u2019s an unforgettable experience, if you have the time and the stamina.\nTo do this, you must have a permit, and these are in high demand. If this sounds like something you would like to do, you can learn more here.\nWhile in Mount Rainier National Park, please practice the seven principles of Leave No Trace: plan ahead, stay on the trail, pack out what you bring to the hiking trail, properly dispose of waste, leave areas as you found them, minimize campfire impacts, be considerate of other hikers, and do not approach or feed wildlife.\nWhen Can You Go Hiking in Mount Rainier National Park?\nThere is a narrow window of time that you can do most of these hikes in Mount Rainier National Park.\nThe hiking season typically starts in late June or early July and ends in October. Outside of this time range, not only are the hiking trails covered in snow, but many of the park roads are closed.\nHere is a general timeline for road closures and openings in Mount Rainier National Park:\nIf you are planning to hike the trails at Mount Rainier, plan your visit from early July through late September.\nAll of the hiking trails are marked with signs like this one.\nOur Recommendations\nOur favorite hikes are the Skyline Trail to Panorama Point (great views for the entire hike), the Mount Fremont Lookout Trail (this was our introduction to Mount Rainier National Park and it was a good one!), the Tolmie Peak Fire Lookout (spectacular views and low crowds), and Silver Falls (short easy hike to a beautiful waterfall).\nThe classic hikes for first-timers are Grove of the Patriarchs, Myrtle Falls or the Skyline Trail (depending on fitness levels), and the Sourdough Ridge Trail to Frozen Lake.\nIf you want a short, easy hike, we recommend Myrtle Falls, the Silver Falls Loop, the Naches Peak Loop, and the Sourdough Ridge Trail.\nIf you want to leave the crowds behind, hike Spray Park and/or Tolmie Peak in Carbon River, the Burroughs Mountain Trail, or the Summerland Trail and go all of the way to Panhandle Gap.\nFor an epic hiking experience, hike to Camp Muir or hike the Wonderland Trail.\nBefore you go, get updated trail and road conditions on the National Park Service website.\nIf you have any questions about the best hikes in Mount Rainier National Park, or if you want to share your favorite hike, let us know in the comment section below.\nMOUNT RAINIER\u00a0NATIONAL PARK:\u00a0Check out our Mount Rainier National Park Travel Guide\u00a0for important travel planning tips, sample itineraries, advice on when to go, where to stay, and more.\nBEST OF MOUNT RAINIER: While in Mount Rainier, top experiences include hiking the top trails in the park and visiting Paradise and Sunrise.
