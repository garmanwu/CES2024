NHOA.TCC announced the successful passing of UL 9540 energy storage system safety certification for EnergyArk. Collaborating with TCC Group's European subsidiary, Atlante, NHOA.TCC plans to build a charging station with energy storage system in Italy in 2024 Q2, the first EnergyArk in Europe. To support NHOA.TCC, TCC Group's high-end lithium battery company, Molicel, showcased the electric racing car McMurtry Sp\u00e9irling, powered by Molicel's ultra-high-power lithium battery. The demonstration highlighted that under the \"EnergyArk Energy Storage with EV Charging Station\" developed by NHOA.TCC, it can provide stable fast charging without impacting the power grid and guarantee safety.\nIn response to the growing trend\u00a0of clean energy, international automotive manufacturers such as Hyundai, KIA, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, VinFast, as well as well-known charger brands like ABB, EVgo, Chaevi, and Star Charge, are all moving towards high-power charging trends, reaching up to 720 kW, and the need for energy storage became evident. European customers expressed challenges in power applications for constructing supercharging stations, while U.S. clients emphasized the demand for energy storage to stabilize electricity consumption, especially supercharging stations that can charge EV trucks in warehouses.\nShowcased DC-DC integrated charging and storage structure impressed CES attendees, addressing power conversion losses and enhancing energy efficiency. EnergyArk, constructed with Ultra-High Performance Concrete (UHPC),\u00a0has raised the clients' interests for its ability to resistant extreme weather conditions, which is crucial in global climate change.\nEnergyArk's successful debut at CES 2024 marked its readiness for international markets, having passed rigorous safety tests, including UL 9540 and IEC 62933-5-2. The energy storage system also complies with NFPA 855 standards. Constructed with UHPC, EnergyArk offers fire resistance, heat resistance, and high-strength characteristics, distinguishing it from traditional metal containers. With three different battery capacities (40, 60, and 1000), EnergyArk is suitable for various indoor and outdoor sites. EnergyArk is equipped with a self-developed energy management system, ensuring that when the battery overheats, the fire extinguishing system automatically activates by submerging the battery in water while maintaining the integrity of the cabinet.\nNHOA.TCC also collaborated with global partners in CES 2024 like WAE, KULR, and ZEROVA. NHOA.TCC and WAE collaborated to develop scalable battery module with high C-rate charging and discharging, achieving an energy density more than 10% higher than competitors. NHOA.TCC and KULR worked together to create extremely safe batteries for energy storage applications. TCC Group's Chairman Nelson An-ping Chang emphasized international competitiveness in energy planning, citing Europe and the U.S. as leaders. He urged partners to contribute to global carbon reduction efforts, providing diverse choices for future generations.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nhoatccs-fireproof-and-fire-extinguishing-energyark-passed-the-strictest-ul-9540-safety-test-showcased-at-the-ces-2024-integrated-charging-and-storage-to-be-deployed-in-italy-in-2024-302031265.html\nSOURCE NHOA.TCC\nTRENDING"

The early-2024 Las Vegas Convention Center gathering afforded NHOA.TCC a global venue for the EnergyArk battery storage cabinet launch. Available in three sizes for electric vehicle charging or commercial level power, the cabinet has panels of UHPC whose compressive strength exceeds 15,000 psi and robust nature provides two hours of protection to heat hovering 1,050\u00b0C (1,920\u00b0F).\nNHOA.TCC developed EnergyArk for indoor or outdoor installations and as an alternative to conventional metal containers. Beyond UHPC construction, the cabinet is equipped with a self-developed energy management system; in the event of overheating, a fire extinguishing system automatically submerges the battery assembly in water while maintaining cabinet integrity. International market readiness is indicated by EnergyArk performance in testing or evaluation per UL 9540, Energy Storage System Requirements; NFPA 855 Standard for the Installation of Stationary Energy Storage Systems; and, (International Electrotechnical Commission) IEC 62933-5-2, Safety requirements for grid-integrated electrical energy storage systems.\nEnergyArk Engineers turned to UHPC keen on eliminating risks related to various energy storage batteries and building a structure imperious to disaster. \u201cWhen it comes to the energy structure of the future, storage cabinets are set to become an indispensable piece of social infrastructure,\u201d NHOA.TCC notes. \u201cThe EnergyArk is capable of overcoming the intermittent nature of renewable energy, solar or wind.\u201d\nPost navigation\nConcrete Currents\nLatest Digital Issue\n2023 Cement Directory\nResource Center\n\u00a9 2023 by Semco Productions, LLC | All rights reserved"
