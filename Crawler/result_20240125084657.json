The new GE Profile UltraFast with Ventless Heat Pump Technology aims to redeem the all-in-one washer-dryer by delivering on its promise of having to load and unload your laundry only once per job \u2014 and it\u2019s been successful enough in doing so to have been named a 2024 CES Innovation Award Honoree.\nThis May Also Interest You:\u00a0What Do You Do With an Old Appliance? How to Recycle Fridges, Washers, Ovens and More\nMore widely found in Europe, the idea behind these mixed machines is great: You put all your laundry in at once, the machine cleans then dries, you take out your clothes to fold them and you're done. No need to move wet clothes to a second machine to get them dry. The reality of combo washer-dryers is something else entirely, though. Usually, the cycles take over four hours, the capacity is small and even when the machine is done, you often have to hang your clothes on a drying rack anyway because they're still damp.\nCES (formerly known as the Consumer Electronics Show) is a convention that takes place in Las Vegas each year to shine a spotlight on the most whizbang consumer tech advancements from all over the world. This year, the Innovation Awards process received over 3,000 submissions, which were carefully evaluated by a panel of engineers, designers, members of the media and more. Awards were given out in 29 different categories. And, thanks to its smartly designed washer-dryer, GE snagged one in the Home Appliances category.\n\"We're continuously evaluating ways to reinvent the chore of laundry, and we believe that we have forever simplified laundry day with this product,\u201d said Ken Rudolph, senior director of product management for clothes care at GE Appliances, in a news release. \u201cWe are thrilled to see years of engineering and design recognized by the authority in consumer technology, and we look forward to making a big splash at CES in January.\"\nHere's a bit more about GE's Profile UltraFast Combo with Ventless Heat Pump Technology:\nWhile all-in-one washer-dryers have been around a while, GE Profile claims to be an improvement upon existing tech. Their breakthrough came with the creation of a new kind of heat pump technology. This innovation pairs high-speed airflow with a sealed heat pump system, enabling the washing and drying of even very large loads in about two hours without the need to vent hot air outside the unit.\nThe product boasts over 30 patents and pending patent applications.\nThe Ventless Heat Pump Technology and High-Airflow Ventless Drying System contribute to the UltraFast Combo's impressive 50% higher energy efficiency compared to the Energy Star standard for electric dryers, according to GE. Additional features include GE's pre-existing Adaptive Smart Dispense, technology that lets you scan your detergent bottle so that the machine knows exactly how much of the product to release during the cleaning cycles. The new machines will also include Microban Antimicrobial Technology, which is meant to fight the buildup of bacteria and other microbes.\nMore Related Articles:\nBeyond technical advancements, the UltraFast Combo's design opens up installation options. Because the heat pump doesn't need to be vented through a tube run out of an exterior wall, owners can install a laundry space almost anywhere with access to water and a drain. The 120V plug requirement allows for flexible placement in small apartments, bathrooms or home gyms.\nA common complaint about washer-dryer combos is that capacity is compromised for functionality. The GE Profile UltraFast Combo has a 4.8-cubic-foot capacity. The company says that this would allow owners to launder a king-size comforter and full bedding set in a single load, reducing overall laundry time. The machine is also designed to be taller than other combos, which makes for convenient retrieval and folding of clothes.\nThe GE UltraFast Combo with Ventless Heat Pump Technology is retailing in the U.S. for a suggested price of $2,899.\nView Plans in Your Area\nView Plans in Your Area\nHOMESERVE\u00ae, the HOMESERVE Design\u00ae and HOMESERVE USA\u00ae are trademarks of HomeServe USA Corp.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "At Last, Barbecue Flavor Without All The Smoke: GE Profile Unveils The New Smart Indoor Smoker At CES 2024\nThe Consumer Electronics Show, better known as CES, is the largest technology convention in the world. Thousands of new products make their debut on the showroom floor each year \u2014 and at CES 2024, held in Las Vegas, Nevada, the food technology sector was bigger than ever. Aside from Jetsons-esque smart stoves and refrigerators, replete with video call screens in their displays, guests were treated to a bevy of food tech devices, from intuitive Barsys cocktail dispensers and Orka meat thermometers to the Sweet Robo, an ice cream-dispensing robot.\nWe at Tasting Table encountered countless new smart grills, ovens, and cooking tools during our rounds at CES, but the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\u00a0was one appliance that took our breath away as soon as we laid eyes on it. Impressed by its efficiency, smoke filtration technology, and stylish design, it wasn't long before we awarded GE's latest launch the Tasting Table Best Of CES 2024 award. The compact at-home smoker is ideal for those with limited kitchen space, producing perfectly smoked meats, cheeses, and more without so much as a trace of haze. Ahead, we'll break down what makes this new release from GE Profile so exciting for home chefs of all skill levels.\nThe GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is a game-changer for foodies in small spaces\nOf course, this innovative release from GE should come as no surprise \u2014 General Electric has been a trusted name in the housewares department for nearly a century since its early days of production in Schenectady, New York. Since 1905, the American company has manufactured top-quality kitchen appliances, from mixers and blenders to refrigerators and ovens. The GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is yet another solid product from the iconic brand, though it's significantly more advanced than its predecessors.\nWhat makes the Smart Indoor Smoker truly exceptional is its active smoke filtration technology, allowing one to develop the richest flavors imaginable in various recipes without ever triggering their smoke alarm. For those with limited space at home \u2014 and yes, even tiny apartment kitchens \u2014 the revolutionary Smart Indoor Smoker is a dream come true. Whether you've always wanted to whip up your own smoked cheese or love experimenting with homemade spice blends, the world is your oyster with GE Profile's latest launch. Just about anything in your kitchen can benefit from its deliciously smoky touch, from a spicy popcorn topping to fudgy brownies and desserts.\nMore to know about the GE Smart Indoor Smoker\nBeyond the impressive feat of creating smoked foods indoors without fog and fumes, the GE Smart Indoor Smoker's design is a sight to behold. Its sleek, glossy body isn't (that)\u00a0much larger than your garden variety air fryer, and its display panel is crisp and easy to read. The smoker also comes with a built-in temperature probe, offering continuous internal readings for the mindful home chef. But perhaps best of all, you can get a closer look at whatever you choose to make as it smokes, thanks to the Smart Indoor Smoker's crystal clear door and soft interior light.\nJust like a traditional outdoor smoker, GE's Smart Indoor Smoker uses real wood pellets to lend foods a robust edge. However, GE's indoor version uses these pellets far more efficiently than a standard smoker would,\u00a0and it doesn't take much of them to add smoky flavor to any dish. What's more, the intensity of the smokiness can be customized depending on your preferences.\nIf all of this news has your mouth watering, you're in luck: GE Profile's Smart Indoor Smoker is currently available for purchase. Retailing for $999, the glossy black smoker is sure to please everyone from beginner barbecue enthusiasts to seasoned home chefs. To start your smoking adventure at home, look for it in the GE Appliances online storefront or from select stores that carry GE Profile appliances."

        "raw_content": "GE Profile\u2122 Makes Smoking Food on Kitchen Countertops Possible with Its Smart Indoor Smoker\nAhead of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES)\u00ae, GE Profile\u2122 today announced the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker with Active Smoke Filtration. The GE Profile\u2122 Smart Indoor Smoker provides a revolutionary way to experience a time-honored cooking method\u2014smoking food, without the hobbyist hassle. With innovative technology and countertop convenience, smoked food no longer requires a huge time commitment, a backyard and nice weather.\nAs the first and only indoor smoker, Active Smoke Filtration technology uses heat and a highly engineered catalyst system to turn real-wood smoke into warm air packed with flavor. The Indoor Smoker is designed to efficiently deliver delicious, wood-smoked seasoning to a variety of foods. Designed for optimal smoke with custom controls and maximum flavor, this unique airflow system, along with tight gaskets and seals keeps the smoke in the appliance, not in the kitchen.\nCreating flexibility for users from novice to pro, smoke intensity and temperature can be separately dialed in to achieve perfect flavor thanks to a separate heat source for burning pellets and cooking foods. Whether a hint of smoke or full smoke flavor is preferred, the Indoor Smoker gives cooks the ability to customize. Five adjustable smoke settings let users control the smoke levels until they find their ideal flavor. This level of customization allows cooks to explore barbeque favorites or new recipes with ease and achieve consistent results. The six preset food settings create amazing results for brisket, pork ribs, pork butt, chicken wings, chicken breast and salmon using a heat source at the bottom of the appliance. Users can also customize their own food and smoke settings for other foods of choice from side dishes to dessert.\n\"We believe that this product will completely change the game when it comes to smoked food,\u201d said Andr\u00e9 Zdanow, executive director of small appliances at GE Appliances. \u201cNot only are we simplifying the smoking process, but we are opening it up as a cooking method to a whole new audience who may not have had the time or outdoor space to try smoking food before. From weeknight dinners to cocktail garnishes and home tailgating to peach cobbler, consumers can explore all the possibilities of having an electric smoker that is ready to go at any time.\u201d\nThe Indoor Smoker delivers the flavors consumers demand from a traditional smoker and it looks sleek in any kitchen. Additional features that make dinner prep and clean up a breeze include:\nThe Indoor Smoker comes with a cookbook crafted by chef Dallas McGarity, executive chef and owner of The Fat Lamb, winner of the Food Network\u2019s cooking challenge show \u201cChopped\u201d and GE Profile chef ambassador. It also includes a temperature probe and a bag of co-branded GE Profile and Kona pellets to get users started. Users can receive up to 20% off when they re-order pellets or schedule a pellet subscription through Kona. If users already have their favorite pellets, the Indoor Smoker is designed to be used with any brand intended for use with pellet grills or\u202fsmokers.\u200b\n\u201cSmoking food is an art form that has been practiced for centuries. Whether you are a novice or an expert smoker, the GE Profile Indoor Smoker will take your smoking skills to the next level, all from the comfort of your kitchen counter,\u201d said chef Dallas McGarity. \u201cI find that smoking food can be a social experience, and this indoor smoker now gives me the flexibility to smoke even small meals inside with my family and friends. From traditional meats to smoked brussels sprouts and desserts like s\u2019mores, the meals you can create are endless.\u201d\nThe Indoor Smoker was invented at FirstBuild, the co-creation, maker space and microfactory owned by GE Appliances. These game-changing features led consumers to invest in this innovation (formerly known as Arden) through an Indiegogo crowdfunding campaign that was backed by 1,156 people and $835,774 in funding.\nBased on its success, it has now graduated to the GE Profile brand and will be available at retailers nationwide for a suggested retail price of $999. For more information about the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker, visit geappliances.com/indoorsmoker.\nFor those attending the Consumer Electronics Show, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker will be on display at the GE Appliances booth # 53317 in The Venetian Las Vegas. Leading up to the show, the innovation will be at CES Unveiled on January 7 and Pepcom\u2019s Digital Experience on January 8. In addition to the Indoor Smoker, the 2024 CES Innovation Award Honoree, the GE Profile UltraFast Combo, 2023 CES Innovation Award Honoree, the GE Profile Smart Mixer, and GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, will also be on display.\nMedia Contacts\nImage Downloads\nVideo Downloads\nDocument Downloads\nMore Downloads\nMore\nNews\nGE Appliances Air & Water Solutions Expands RealMAX Gas Water Heater Series With Ultra Low NOx and Power Vent Options\nGE Appliances Air & Water Solutions Announces New VRF MRV-5H System for Commercial Spaces\nGE Appliances Air & Water Solutions Exhibits Industry-Leading Innovations at the 2024 AHR Expo\nMonogram Luxury Appliances Launches Induction Professional Range to Further Elevate the Cooking Experience"

        "raw_content": "GE Profile\u2122 UltraFast Combo Named CES\u00ae Innovation Awards Honoree by the Consumer Technology Association\u00ae\nLOUISVILLE, Ky \u2013 November 15, 2023 \u2013 GE Profile\u2122 today announced that it was named a 2024 CES\u00ae Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category for its GE Profile UltraFast Combo with Ventless Heat Pump Technology. The GE Profile UltraFast Combo combines a washer and dryer into one machine, simplifying the laundry chore into one efficient process by eliminating the need to transfer the load and driving industry-leading cycle times.\nAs a brand rooted in innovation, GE Profile harnessed the power of advanced technology, space-saving design, and intuitive features to create a seamless laundry experience that saves time, energy and space.\nThe CES Innovation Awards program, owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)\u00ae, is an annual competition honoring outstanding design and engineering in 29 consumer technology product categories. An elite panel of industry expert judges, including members of the media, designers, engineers and more, reviewed submissions for\u00a0innovation, engineering,\u00a0functionality, aesthetic and design. This year\u2019s CES Innovation Awards program received a record number of more than 3,000 submissions.\nWhile all-in-one washer-dryers have existed for decades, the consumer experience has been less than ideal. GE Profile engineers spent seven years working on a newly patented heat pump technology that matches high speed airflow with a sealed heat pump system to wash and dry a large load in about 2 hours[1]. The product holds more than 30 patents and pending patent applications.\nThe ventless heat pump technology and High-Airflow Ventless Drying System is also 50% more energy efficient[2] than the Energy Star standard for electric dryers. The UltraFast Combo is packed with other technology that makes laundry easier, such as Adaptive Smart Dispense and Microban\u00ae Antimicrobial Technology.\nThe design of the UltraFast Combo also enables greater flexibility and removes limitations in users\u2019 homes. Eliminating the need for exterior venting, owners can construct a laundry space virtually anywhere with a water hookup and a drain. By pairing this feature with a 120V plug requirement, users can move away from a designated laundry room and fit the machine in a small city apartment, bathroom or home gym.\nWhile other washer-dryer combos have sacrificed capacity, the GE Profile UltraFast Combo still gives owners a 4.8-cu.-ft. capacity. The machine can clean a king-size comforter and a full set of bedding in a single load to reduce the amount of time spent doing laundry. The UltraFast Combo is also designed at an ergonomically desirable height for retrieving and folding clothes on top.\n\"We're continuously evaluating ways to reinvent the chore of laundry, and we believe that we have forever simplified laundry day with this product,\u201d said Ken Rudolph, senior director of product management for clothes care at GE Appliances. \u201cWe are thrilled to see years of engineering and design recognized by the authority in consumer technology, and we look forward to making a big splash at CES in January.\"\nFor those attending the Consumer Electronics Show in January, the GE Profile UltraFast Combo will be on display at the GE Appliances booth # 53317 in The Venetian Las Vegas. Leading up to the show, the innovation will be at CES Unveiled on January 7 and Pepcom\u2019s Digital Experience on January 8.\nAvailable in Carbon Graphite with a highly responsive LED control panel, the UltraFast Combo with Ventless Heat Pump Technology is available at retailers nationwide for a suggested retail price of $2,899. Through the month of November, many retailers will offer a promotion of $700 off for a discounted price of $2,199.

The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

But It's Still Fire!\nThe GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker purports to be a first-of-its-kind electric appliance that brings the fun and flavor of an outdoor smoker to your kitchen. The smoker uses smoke from real wood \u2014 just like an outdoor smoker \u2014 and precision controls and smoke settings allow you to season your food to your liking. Instead of setting off your smoke alarms, the airflow system and Active Smoke Filtration technology keep any smoky fumes sealed inside the appliance.\nThe system connects to the SmartHQ app, the platform used by GE for its other smart appliances. Anyone who\u2019s ever used an outdoor smoker knows that smoking food is something of a waiting game. So, the app allows you to check the status of your food remotely. You can also change up the settings on the app so your meat\u2019s ready when you are. According to GE, the connected appliance can receive over-the-air updates for increased functionality in the future.\nThis smoker could be a good option for those who want to dip their toes into smoking but aren\u2019t ready to \u2014 or living situations don\u2019t allow them to \u2014 get an outdoor rig. Six built-in presets make it easy to get started, even if you don\u2019t know much about smoking.

Sure, these industry-focused events are sometimes niche, but they function as amazing resources and provide plenty of opportunity for product discovery \u2014 at their best, you might be unearthing items that could really disrupt the way we live and change our lives for the better one day. Other times, it\u2019s about discovering an amazing maker or a fairly new company that\u2019s doing something cool in the home space or just spotting an emerging trend in the design space. And the more you attend these shows, the more you\u2019re able to suss out what\u2019s actually new and innovative, which brings me to this list. I searched high and low for the best home products coming out of the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) that wrapped last Friday in Las Vegas, Nevada. Here\u2019s what earned Apartment Therapy\u2019s Best of CES seal \u2014 and what you should keep your eye out for coming to market through this year (if not available already).\nKohler SpaViva Handshower & Cleansing Device\nYour self-care routine just got a major upgrade, thanks to this new handshower from Kohler that\u00a0moonlights as a multifunctional beauty tool. Not only does it feature two of Kohler\u2019s best-in-class spray technologies (the heat-retaining Katalyst spray and a new Microbubble spray capable of penetrating the skin for a deeper cleanse), but it also comes with four attachments with rotating heads that you can switch between: There\u2019s a face brush, a body brush, a body massager, and a body scrubber (which is like a pumice stone and meant for heels and rough skin patches). Hello, at-home spa time \u2014 and all for around $300 when it launches later in this quarter.\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nWith the GE Profile new Smart Indoor Smoker, now you can wood smoke ribs, brisket, and other smaller cuts of meat right on your countertops \u2014 and it\u2019s quicker, easier, and less dependent on having a big backyard and the perfect weather, too. At just under $1,000, the machine is an investment, but it has all the bells and whistles you\u2019d want out of a smart mini smoker, from five adjustable smoke settings to get the flavor dialed in just right to six food pre-settings and the ability to customize your own settings, too. Even better, the unit features a built-in temperature probe and dishwasher-safe, removable racks and drip trays for easy cleanup. It\u2019s also the first (and only!) indoor smoker with active smoke filtration technology, which converts the smoke to warm air so it can function inside closed doors.\nMila Halo\nTouted as \u201cthe smartest humidifier and air purifier combo out there,\u201d the Mila Halo features a sleek design and packs both a humidifier and air purification system into its fairly small footprint. The machine aims to eliminate over-humidification \u2014 and the annoyance of constantly needing to refill the water tank \u2014 by sensing when you\u2019re in the room with it and only switching itself on then. It\u2019s also going to target and remove pollutants to improve the quality of your air, fulfilling its role as an air purifier, too. On the design front, although it looks neutral here, you can expect to be able to customize the device\u2019s outer panels with color and pattern to better match your decor.\nTineco Floor One Switch S7\nWouldn\u2019t you love a vacuum cleaner that could handle wet messes as well as it does dry ones? Meet the Tineco Floor One Switch S7, a multi-mode cleaner that can toggle between being a floor washer and a stick vacuum in just seconds. You can expect powerful suction from the vacuum\u2019s brush head and a self-cleaning system out of the floor washer, which ensures the water you\u2019re using on your floors is fresh. Other attachments that come with the package can help you reach into crevices and tackle the cleaning of soft surfaces, too. And the company says the battery life is better than others.\nDreo Chemaker Combi Fryer\nWhat started out on Kickstarter (and took over 50 prototypes and over 20 months of testing to create) has now come full circle: Appliance brand Dreo exhibited its award-winning ChefMaker Combi Fryer for the first time at CES, and it\u2019s hard not to take notice of it. The machine, which looks and functions like an air fryer, really is so much more than that. Case in point: Its \u201cCombi Cook technology,\u201d which has taken cooking technique best practices and translated them into an algorithm that uses temperature, moisture, and cooking time as factors to cook meats, seafood, poultry, veggies, and more to perfection every time, with just the push of a few buttons. It also works along with your smartphone, too, where you can access recipes and video guides.\nLG Universal UP Kit\nIn collaboration with its Disabled Advisory Council, LG unveiled its Universal Up Kit, which consists\u00a0of attachments that will make their appliances much easier to use from a mobility perspective (think: handles that make LG\u2019s washer door and detergent drawers easier to open and close, a detachable wheel strut that redistributes the weight of LG\u2019s CordZero stick vacuum for better maneuvering, and more).\nGovee AI Gaming Sync Box Kit\nOfficially announced at CES last year, these LED Gaming Lights are now readily available, roughly half-price of their original retail, and admittedly a niche pick for a home design site. But if you\u2019re into games like Apex Legends, or you just want to take your gaming experience to the next level, why haven\u2019t you bought this kit that will color match and sync your Govee lights to in-game movements and actions? They\u2019re even compatible with movies and other media \u2014 little kids and adults alike will love \u2018em.\nExobrew Craft Gen 3\nHome brewing used to be a messy and very tedious process, but all that has changed with the\u00a0Exobrew Craft Gen 3. Retailing for $999 (but currently on sale for $879), this app-enabled and\u00a0fairly compact brewing system will allow you to make 1.6 gallons of beer, kombucha, or cider at\u00a0a time in a span of three to 30 days. It\u2019s the perfect splurge-worthy gift for the tinkerer and beverage connoisseur in your life.\nThe Bello\nThe Bello is the ultimate twofer for your at-home hydration needs. Purify and infuse your drinking\u00a0water with this beautiful countertop gadget-meets-filtration system that removes microplastics, heavy metals, bacterias, and chemicals and adds natural essences with flavor capsules.\nRobrock Zeo One\nAlthough the Roborock Zeo One is officially only available for pre-order in Germany right now, it\u00a0made our list for its innovative all-in-one washer/dryer design that features sensors that can dry delicates at precise temperatures and optimized detergent dosing for less waste and optimal washing performance. The unit will also collect and discard the lint it produces via a built-in tool.\nHow-To Toolkits\nRead\nCompany"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: GE's Latest Smart Lights Will Spruce Up Your Kitchen Cabinets\nFalling under the Cync Reveal branding, the new lights come in either edge-lit fixture or puck form.\nGE Lighting has a slew of new smart products to show off at CES, including an expanded Matter-capable lineup. But the most eye-catching products go in your kitchen: undercabinet and under-counter smart lights.\nUndercabinet and under-counter lights aren't new, of course, but usually, you're limited to motion sensor-activated white lighting. Savant, the parent company behind GE Lighting, is revealing what it calls a \"first in the North America market\" for undercabinet lighting: full-color support.\nFalling under the Cync Reveal branding, the new lights are \"HD+ Full Color\" and come in either edge-lit fixture or puck form. You can hardwire the lights into your home or use a plug if you have one in a convenient spot.\nThe lights are diffused, and Savant claims they are easy to install with captive screws, but this is a DIY product, so be prepared to put in some elbow grease. The lights also work with either the GE Sync app or Savant's app for its custom smart homes. You can also control them with Google Assistant or Alexa, and they're Matter-capable.\nPricing \"starts\" at $59.99, though it wasn't immediately clear if that's the puck pricing or if the edge-lit fixtures will come in multiple sizes. You can purchase Cync Reveal at Lowes, Target, and Amazon later this year.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nSavant also pledged to expand its lineup of Matter-enabled products to 20 in 2024. That includes the Cync Direct Connect Full Color Smart Bulb, Cync Smart Indoor Plug, the Direct Connect Full Color and Reveal line of bulbs and wafers, the Cync Outdoor Smart Plug, and the Cync Smart Thermostat.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

But we did notice some genuinely exciting things this year, including the one item almost all of us were talking about: a TV that becomes completely see-through.\nHere\u2019s more about that, and a baker\u2019s dozen other things that we\u2019re looking forward to in 2024:\nA TV you look through\nLG Transparent OLED (LG OLED T, LG OLED Signature T), later this year, price TBD\nLG\u2019s wireless, transparent OLED TV is a fantastical concept that few people will buy\u2014but everyone will want.\nUsing proprietary wireless video technology and some kind of pixel magic that LG didn\u2019t fully explain, the 77-inch 4K transparent OLED TV creates images that seem to float in space.\nFish appear to be swimming in midair. Snow appears to materialize in your living room. When turned off, the TV basically disappears.\nIt also has a rolling contrast screen that can slide up behind it to turn it into a traditional OLED TV.\nIt has no bezel, no wires, nowhere to plug anything in, and\u2014somehow\u2014no discernible heat signature (I reached behind the transparent display, and it was surprisingly cool).\nWhile there is a roughly 1-inch-thick screen suspended in the TV\u2019s housing frame, you can see right through to the wall behind it, though the glass still has a slight sepia tone. The transparent display creates a kind of faux 3D effect while you\u2019re watching, such that the images appear to occupy the full space between the wall at the rear and the front of the screen.\nThough AV fans may argue that the effect dispels traditional cinematic immersion, it\u2019s still an undeniably captivating spin on the usual TV-watching experience.\nLG has stated that the LG OLED T will be available to buy later this year, and though we\u2019ll love to see it show up in department stores and hotel lobbies, it\u2019s not likely to be priced for the average buyer\u2014unless you have tens of thousands to spare for a nearly invisible TV.\nA more comfortable heart-rate monitor\nGarmin HRM-Fit, available now, $150\nGarmin unveiled the HRM-Fit, which attempts to eliminate some of the long-standing discomfort associated with wearing a heart-rate monitor.\nIn the demos we saw, the HRM-Fit clipped to a sports bra, negating the need to wear a band across the entire chest, which we\u2019ve noticed sometimes leads to chafing or irritation with other monitors.\nAside from heart rate, the monitor also tracks steps and calories burned, as well as feedback on your running strides (through the Garmin Connect app). Garmin advertises the HRM-Fit as having a one-year battery life.\nA smart gadget for good boys\nPawport, May 2024, from $450\nThe smart home was ubiquitous at CES, with internet-connected models of nearly any device imaginable on display.\nTopping my list of favorites was the Pawport, a smart pet door that opens and closes automatically when your pet approaches.\nWhat is so appealing to me (note, I don\u2019t even have a pet and am still unreasonably thrilled by this thing) is how thoughtfully the software and hardware were designed. The result is the essence of what makes a \u201csmart\u201d device desirable.\nThe Pawport consists of a pair of powered aluminum doors connected by steel hinges to a steel frame. You screw the frame around an existing pet door and then slide the Pawport down over the frame.\nAround the inside of the doors is rubber weatherstripping that compresses when the doors close to form an airtight seal. The doors are either insulated or have rechargeable, slide-in batteries that last several months between charges.\nOn top is a suite of intuitive touch controls, including open, close, lock, and power.\nThe companion to the doors is a collar fob with a rechargeable battery that sends a Bluetooth signal to the Pawport so that it opens when the pet approaches from inside or outside. It\u2019s also smart enough not to open the door if your pup decides to lie down within range of the door.\nThe Pawport is due in May and will be sold in a range of sizes and finishes\u2014that\u2019s plenty of time for me to convince my wife that a dog is the thing our family is really missing.\nSecurity over the longer range\nAbode Edge Camera, later this year, $200\nOutdoor security cameras should help give you peace of mind, but if Wi-Fi connection issues plague your outdoor cameras, you\u2019ll find no peace.\nAbode\u2019s new answer to that problem\u2014the Abode Edge Camera\u2014replaces traditional Wi-Fi with HaLow wireless technology, which gives it a range of almost 1.5 miles.\nIn addition to long range, HaLow is good at penetrating structures, making this camera suitable for outdoor use while the unit\u2019s wireless hub, which connects to your main network, sits safely indoors.\nThe weatherproof camera includes a 6,000 mAh rechargeable battery, which the company says will power the camera for up to a year.\nThe camera can integrate with Abode\u2019s security systems, including the one we reviewed.\nOther security camera companies have tackled the long-distance Wi-Fi problem by skipping it altogether and including 4G LTE connections in their cameras, but those models require an expensive subscription fee through carriers such as T-Mobile and Verizon.\nAbode\u2019s Edge camera is expected to sell for $200 and requires just a $4-per-month service plan for cloud video storage.\nSimple, (almost) instant smoking\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker, available now, $1,000\nAt CES I saw more grills, smokers, and meat thermometers than in my local Home Depot, but the standout was the countertop GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker.\nSmoking adds distinct flavor to all kinds of foods, but it\u2019s typically done over lower temperatures for long hours, requiring the cook to camp out in the backyard by a hot black metal bin to feed the fire and actively manage the smoke and the temperature. To do it well, in other words, you need passion, time, and skill.\nIf the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker works as billed\u2014the company says you can set it to specific recipes and let it do the work, or you can independently control the heat or smoke level\u2014it can effectively turn smoking into a readily accessible cooking technique for anyone who wants it, just like air frying or sous vide. Imagine popping a few eggplants into a microwave-sized appliance to make killer homemade baba ghanouj on a weeknight, or smoking your own spice blends or chiles whenever the mood strikes.\nI got a sneak peek at this cooker late last year on a research trip to the GE Appliances manufacturing plant in Louisville, Kentucky, where I got to sample some perfectly prepared wings hot out of the box\u2014tender, smoky, sweet, and moist.\nA few more important details: The smoker uses the same pellets as traditional pellet smokers do. It fits 40 wings, a brisket cut in half, or a whole chicken, and it has the same technology to keep the smoke safely inside the appliance and out of your home as the hearth oven made by Monogram, GE Appliances\u2019s luxury brand.\nA simple pocket drone for action selfies\nHoverAir X1, available now, from $350\nDJI has had a death grip on the hobby drone market for the past few years, and for good reason. The image quality, control systems, and autonomous flight modes on the brand\u2019s drones have excelled in our testing, and DJI\u2019s lineup satisfies almost every budget and need.\nThat\u2019s why I was excited to find a tiny, cheap, and potentially uniquely usable drone made by a different company at this year\u2019s CES.\nThe HoverAir X1 is a 4.4-ounce, foldable drone that aims to enable people to capture quick and easy close-up footage. It lacks a dedicated controller, instead focusing on autonomous flight modes and subject-tracking software to follow activities.\nWe\u2019ll be testing this drone against our picks to see if this $350 model ($400 with two extra batteries) can compete with the much more expensive and versatile DJI Mini Pro series. While we don\u2019t think it\u2019ll replace the more expensive cinematic drones, it may be a useful and relatively affordable tool for folks looking to capture simple follow-along footage.\nWash and dry in one laundry machine\nGE Profile UltraFast Combo Washer/Dryer, available now, $2,900\nIn the future, will a combo washer/dryer actually dry your clothes?\nCombo washer/dryers were plentiful at CES this year, and we found the GE Profile UltraFast Combo Washer/Dryer to be the most intriguing.\nTwo-in-one laundry machines aren\u2019t new, but they\u2019re generally less popular. These machines are heat-pump dryers, which use a closed-loop heat system (no vents) to dry clothes at a lower temperature. In practice that has made them less effective at drying clothes.\nDeveloping the UltraFast Combo required years of GE research into heat-pump dryers, which has resulted in patented technology meant to boost the drying process. If this new approach substantially improves drying performance, it could be the beginning of a major change for laundry appliances.\nA ventless machine that requires less space and less time to operate could transform how people do laundry. Even better: Heat-pump dryers use substantially less energy than traditional dryers, and these home appliances qualify for home energy rebates under the Inflation Reduction Act. We\u2019ll be testing this combo washer/dryer, along with several others, later in the year.\nIn-ear translation and out-of-ear sound\nVasco Translator E1, June 2024, $390\nVasco has put its impressive handheld live translator into an earbud format. The Vasco Translator E1 earpiece translates nearly 50 languages in real time (though it still needs to be connected to an app on your phone).\nAnd if the final product works like the demo, its performance will be impressive.\nVasco spent a lot of time working with linguists to address idioms and variations in meaning that direct word-for-word translations don\u2019t consider, which can be crucial to understanding someone in business settings, at medical appointments, or when you\u2019re speaking with local police. The translated text is visible in the app and spoken through the earpiece.\nMagSafe-like wireless charging for Android phones\nBaseus Qi2 Magpro Magnetic Wireless Charging Car Mount, early 2024, price TBD\nBig advancements in charging technology are rare, but a new development in this sphere was hard to miss at this year\u2019s CES: Qi2 (pronounced \u201cchee two\u201d) wireless charging.\nLike Apple\u2019s MagSafe, Qi2 uses rings of magnets to ensure easy alignment between phone and charger, and it allows any compatible device to charge at up to 15 W\u2014twice as fast as the original Qi spec could deliver. Even better, it isn\u2019t proprietary to Apple, so any device that rolls out with a Qi2 certification going forward (maybe the next Pixel?) will be able to take advantage of its faster charging speeds and sturdy magnetic connection.\nOf all the Qi2 chargers we saw on the showroom floor this week\u2014and there were many, from well-known brands like Anker, ESR, and Hyper\u2014we\u2019re most excited about a wireless-charging car mount from Baseus (set to launch in early 2024). Not only does it support Qi2\u2019s 15 W charging speeds, but it also has a small built-in fan to help your phone stay cool. This is handy since wireless chargers in general are prone to overheating, which can damage your device\u2019s battery over time.\nTurntable music that doesn\u2019t have to stop\nVictrola Automatic Turntable, later this year, $200\nWhile some vinyl enthusiasts want turntables that let them tweak every aspect, others, especially those new to the hobby, want something that doesn\u2019t require so much homework\u2014or money.\nThe Victrola Automatic is the latter kind.\nAs a fully automatic turntable, it lowers the tonearm to begin play and raises it at the end. Just place your record down and hit the play button. Victrola also introduced a repeat mode that automatically moves the stylus back to the beginning of the record and plays it again (and again), a useful feature if you\u2019re spinning a favorite.\nThe Victrola Automatic can connect to wired or wireless speakers and includes RCA outputs with a switchable preamp, plus Bluetooth to stream to a pair of wireless speakers, such as the Edifier S1000MKII, our pick for the best powered speakers with Bluetooth.\nComputer monitors go OLED\nAsus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDM Monitor, later this year, price TBD\nPC monitors are getting bigger, brighter, and equipped with far more contrast than ever before.\nNearly every PC vendor announced a new 4K OLED monitor at CES, so we expect a lot of competition for our best 4K monitor guide this year.\nMost LCD monitors you\u2019ve seen have a backlight that shines through the TV\u2019s picture, illuminating it to be visible. In OLED technology, each one of the screen\u2019s pixels illuminates itself and can individually turn on or turn off for the most pure black tones.\nFor gamers, this year\u2019s OLED displays are especially eye-catching. The LG UltraGear 32GS95UE, for instance, can switch what\u2019s on the display at 240 Hz, or 240 times per second. That higher refresh rate makes animations and motion on the screen seem more crisp and real. And the 32GS95UE can even boost the refresh rate to a staggering 480 Hz, if it knocks its 4K resolution down to 1080p. For everybody else, OLEDs offer fantastic color accuracy and nearly infinite contrast.\nWe\u2019ll be keeping our eyes out for that LG monitor, as well as Asus\u2019s ROG Swift PG32UCDM, which supports the DolbyVision HDR format.\nAI comes to your laptop\nVarious laptops from many brands, later this year, prices vary\nMicrosoft has dubbed 2024 \u201cthe year of the AI PC.\u201d\nThe addition of the flashy new Copilot shortcut key allows even quicker access to your PC\u2019s AI capabilities. It also marks the first major change to the Windows keyboard in nearly three decades.\nBut the more significant change is under the hood. This year\u2019s newest PCs with Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra processors have NPUs, or neural processing units, that run machine-learning processes locally. As a result, these tasks can run faster, can use less battery life, and can be more secure than sending them off to the cloud.\nSome notable examples of laptops with these processors include new versions of our top ultrabook picks that are available now\u2014the HP Spectre x360 14, the Asus Zenbook 14 OLED (UX3405), and the Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 12\u2014as well as a fleet of other premium laptops shipping in the coming months.\nRight now, AI PC features are limited\u2014the prime example is Windows Studio effects, which use AI for video-conferencing features such as background blur and noise cancellation. But now that NPUs are available in a big way from Intel and AMD, many laptop and software companies are building apps and features that take advantage of them.\nFor example, you\u2019ll be able to use a conversational interface for navigating and changing settings on your PC without having to dig through labyrinthine menus, or ask for a summary of a meeting transcript. We expect to see these AI PC features evolve over the coming years.\nPC gaming handhelds are here to stay, and Intel is getting involved\nMSI Claw A1M, later this year, price TBD\nIt\u2019s been almost two years since Valve and AMD brought handheld PC gaming to the masses with the Linux-based Steam Deck, and 2023 saw Asus and Lenovo join in with the Windows-based ROG Ally Extreme and Legion Go, respectively.\nBut MSI\u2019s new partnership with Intel for its upcoming Claw gaming handheld\u2014announced at CES and featuring a Meteor Lake\u2013based system-on-a-chip\u2014is the clearest indication yet that the major players in PC gaming are taking these devices more seriously than ever.\nMSI\u2019s Claw borrows heavily from the ROG Ally Extreme. It has a similar form, down to the programmable buttons on the back of each side grip and the function buttons on either side of its 1080p, variable-refresh-rate display. But the differences are obvious as well.\nThe rear of the Claw features a heavily vented design that MSI claims will help with heat dissipation, and MSI has stressed that the included 53 Wh battery should give two hours of battery life on its maximum performance settings, beating out the ROG Ally Extreme and even Lenovo\u2019s Legion Go.\nMSI will still have its work cut out for it against bigger players, and we have good reason to wonder how Intel\u2019s new hardware will fare compared with AMD\u2019s more mature graphics tech. We don\u2019t know how much effective battery life the Claw will have in real-world scenarios, or how easily it will manage different power profiles.\nAt CES, MSI was using October\u2019s Assassin\u2019s Creed Mirage to demonstrate the Claw\u2019s capabilities, but it wasn\u2019t running especially well, and the system-management software was sluggish and poorly organized.\nThe Claw is likely a couple of months away still, and every one of these mainstream gaming handhelds has launched in rough shape\u2014it was months before the ROG Ally Extreme felt stable, the Legion Go is still a work in progress, and the recent Steam Deck OLED model has seen dozens of beta updates since its November launch. We\u2019ll have to wait and see how the Claw comes together in February or March.\nRegardless, Intel\u2019s entry into the market is a clear indication that it thinks the demand for this kind of device is only going to grow, and after spending time with all of them, I\u2019m inclined to agree.\nFaceTime calls made easy\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit, later this year, $180\nBelkin\u2019s newest device is a motorized, auto-tracking iPhone dock that enables your phone camera to follow your face\u2014not only around the frame, but 360 degrees around. What this means: FaceTime calls and video recordings can follow you totally hands-free.\nBecause the dock uses Apple\u2019s DockKit API, you don\u2019t have to install an app to set it up. Pairing the dock with your iPhone takes seconds\u2014and the tracking is really good.\nOnce you place your iPhone on the dock\u2019s base, the Stand Pro instantly connects to it via NFC (near-field communication, the same technology that lets you make contactless mobile payments), and it uses Bluetooth to maintain its connection.\nYou can\u00a0activate or deactivate the tracking with the push of a single button, and the stand comes equipped with a screw port in case you want to attach it to a tripod, too. The Stand Pro also charges your iPhone via 15 W MagSafe charging, and the dock itself offers five-hour battery life when unplugged. We were impressed by the demo and can\u2019t wait to test the dock once it\u2019s available.\nThis article was edited by Jason Chen and Ben Frumin.\nMeet your guide\nWirecutter Staff\nFurther reading\nThe Best of CES 2022: What We\u2019re Most Looking Forward To\nby Wirecutter Staff\nWirecutter\u2019s expert staff found a few things to look forward to from CES 2022, including a smarter faucet and a projector that doubles as a portable speaker.\nThe Best Electric Vehicle Chargers for Home\nby Sarah Witman\nAfter 28 hours of research and 85 hours of testing, we found the best ways to charge your J1772 (non-Tesla) or Tesla electric vehicle at home.\nWhat We\u2019re Looking Forward To From CES 2019\nby Wirecutter Staff\nWirecutter reporters and editors spent three days working overtime at CES 2019 to find the new stuff that might actually improve your life this year.\nThe Best of CES 2023: What We\u2019re Looking Forward to Most\nby Wirecutter Staff\nA smarter water faucet, an excellent wireless speaker, and a cleaning genie were among our favorite things from CES 2023.\nWirecutter is the product recommendation service from The New York Times.

After ChatGPT burst onto the scene last year, generative AI buzz quickly swept the tech world. Now, it seems like every tech company out there is racing to incorporate artificial intelligence into their products.\nOf course, some AI implementations are little more than transparent attempts to capitalize on all the buzz. That\u2019s not always the case, however, and so many highlights from CES 2024 introduced us to clever, innovative ways to make use of AI.\nThen, there were plenty of exciting new products that had nothing to do with AI. After all, not everything out there truly stands to benefit from the addition of AI features.\nBGR has been covering CES since the site was founded 18 years ago. We\u2019re experts at separating innovative new products from fluff. Now that we\u2019ve seen all there is to see at this year\u2019s show in Las Vegas, Nevada, we\u2019re ready to share our favorite new launches from CES 2024.\nSign up for the most interesting tech & entertainment news out there.\nBy signing up, I agree to the Terms of Use and have reviewed the Privacy Notice.\nTable of contents\nLG G4 and M4 OLED TVs\nWhen many people think of CES, new TVs are the first things that come to mind. As such, it seems appropriate to start with our favorite new televisions that debuted at CES 2024.\nLG\u2019s 2024 OLED TV lineup includes several additions and updates. But our favorite new models are the LG OLED G4 TV and the LG SIGNATURE OLED M4 TV.\nBesides featuring the best OLED screens in the business, both new models are powered by LG\u2019s next-generation a11 processor. And as you might have guessed, AI capabilities are featured heavily. According to LG, the new a11 chipset offers 70% better graphics performance and 30% faster processing speeds compared to its previous-gen chip.\nThe G4 and M4 OLED TVs use LG\u2019s new AI upscaling technology to sharpen objects and reduce blur. LG says its AI analyzes images down to the pixel so it can enhance video as it\u2019s displayed. Here\u2019s what LG has to say on the matter:\nLG\u2019s newest OLED TVs come with upgraded AI upscaling utilizing precise pixel-level image analysis, to effectively sharpen objects and backgrounds that may appear blurry. All driven by the discerning judgment of the AI itself, the company\u2019s OLED TVs deliver a more clear and vibrant viewing experience. Moreover, the ingenious AI processor adeptly refines colors by analyzing frequently used shades that best convey the mood and emotional elements intended by filmmakers and content creators. Dynamic Tone Mapping Pro splits pictures into blocks and fine-tunes brightness and contrast by analyzing variations in brightness where light enters the scene, creating images that look more three-dimensional.\nOther highlights include webOS updates, variable refresh rates up to 144Hz, and plenty more. Also, LG\u2019s wonderfully bright Micro Lens Array tech is now available on screens up to 83 inches in size.\nSpeaking of sizes, the LG SIGNATURE OLED M4 TV will come in four sizes: 65-inch, 77-inch, 83-inch, and 97-inch. Meanwhile, the LG OLED G4 TV will have five different size options: 55-inch, 65-inch, 77-inch, 83-inch, and 97-inch.\nAll that is just the tip of the iceberg. You can learn more about the stunning new LG OLED G4 TV and the wireless LG SIGNATURE OLED M4 TV in LG\u2019s press release. Of note, pricing and availability details haven\u2019t been announced.\nKohler Numi 2.0 smart toilet\nKohler has always been at the forefront of the industry when it comes to quality and innovation. I have a Kohler Sensate faucet in my kitchen that I\u2019m not sure I could live without. Now, I have a new Kohler product to obsess over. Unfortunately, the product in question is a bit outside my reach this time.\nCES 2024 marks the first time we have included a toilet in our roundup of the best new products shown off in Las Vegas. To be fair, however, it\u2019s one of the most impressive and innovative toilets that has ever existed.\nThe first thing that catches the eye is the Kohler Numi 2.0 smart toilet\u2019s sleek, futuristic design with integrated ambient lighting. Other bells and whistles include built-in speakers, Amazon Alexa integration, a heated seat, and hands-free opening and closing thanks to a motion sensor.\nA built-in bidet might be a foregone conclusion, but you might not have expected the warm air dryer with adjustable temperature and fan speed. There\u2019s even a self-cleaning function that uses UV light and electrolyzed water to clean the toilet automatically.\nThe Kohler Numi 2.0 is truly something you would expect to see in a billionaire\u2019s home. With a list price of and a current price tag starting at $8,625, however, you don\u2019t need to be Elon Musk to afford one. It\u2019s not cheap by any stretch of the imagination, but it\u2019ll certainly fit into plenty of high-end bathroom remodel budgets.\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nFor every new TV and laptop announced at CES this year, there are dozens of new smartphone accessories in exhibits all over the show. Hundreds upon hundreds of new accessories are on display, which means it takes something very special to catch our attention. Enter the new Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit, which will undoubtedly be a game-changer for creators and young kids alike.\nHow many times have you tried to record a quick TikTok or even a long video, only to find that you stepped out of frame when you watched it back? One time, my entire right arm and shoulder were out of frame for five whole minutes in a video I was recording. Needless to say, I had to reshoot the whole thing even though it was an otherwise perfect take.\nIf I had the Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit at the time, it would have been an entirely different story.\nThe new Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit introduced by Belkin at CES 2024 is a sleek, compact iPhone stand. It has a round base with a single arm that extends upward to the iPhone mount. As the name \u201cAuto-Tracking Stand Pro\u201d suggests, the base and arm are motorized so they can move to keep the subject in frame at all times. It\u2019s compatible with all iPhone models from the 12-series onward because they support Apple\u2019s DockKit framework for motorized stands.\nAlso, the stand doesn\u2019t need to be plugged in to operate. It has a built-in battery that lasts for up to five hours of use. The battery can also power the stand\u2019s built-in 15W MagSafe wireless charger.\nOf course, Belkin isn\u2019t the first company to come up with the idea. There are already a few on the market, though most are of questionable quality from no-name brands.\nThe Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit, on the other hand, is a Belkin product. That means you can expect the best of the best regarding quality and performance. Also, similar products from no-name companies don\u2019t have the awesome auto-tilt feature found on Belkin\u2019s new stand. Instead, they can only swivel from side to side, while Belkin\u2019s stand can tilt 90 degrees up and down in addition to rotating 360 degrees on its base.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit will retail for $179.99 when preorders launch later this month. You\u2019ll find more information in Belkin\u2019s press release.\nBelkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Wireless Charger with Qi2\nThe new Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand is an update to the wildly popular current model. It\u2019s one of the most popular charging stations out there for Apple devices, and users love it. I have one myself, and I\u2019ve been using it for quite some time. As much as I like the one I already have, however, I\u2019ll ditch it in a second once the new model starts shipping.\nBelkin\u2019s upgraded BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand features the same great design as the original. It can charge a MagSafe-compatible iPhone, Apple Watch, and AirPods all at the same time. Plus, it supports charging speeds of up to 15W. The new-and-improved version adds support for the new wireless charging standard, Qi2. That means it has all the same great features as the original but is also future-proof.\nHere\u2019s what Belkin has to say about its new model:\nLeveraging the new Qi2 standard, this powerful 3-in-1 wireless charger offers perfect alignmentand reliable charging for Qi2-enabled devices at 15W, fast charging for Apple Watch Series 7and later, and optimal charging for wireless earbuds. Built to include an adjustable hinge, userscan effortlessly adjust the angle of the phone for optimal viewing while watching videos, readingarticles or video chatting. It is made with a minimum 75% post-consumer recycled (PCR)materials.\nThe new Belkin BoostCharge Pro 3-in-1 Magnetic Stand with Qi2 will be released in March 2024. It\u2019ll retail for $149.99, just like the previous-generation model.

The name \u201cSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator with AI Family Hub+\u201d doesn\u2019t exactly roll off the tongue. Thankfully, the name doesn\u2019t really matter when it comes to this sleek, feature-packed new smart fridge.\nAnd yes, of course it has AI.\nThe latest addition to Samsung\u2019s Bespoke kitchen appliance lineup is the company\u2019s smartest refrigerator ever. It takes all the features people loved from last year\u2019s model and spices them up with a pinch of AI for flavor.\nFor example, the new Bespoke 4-Door Flex fridge has an interior camera that can recognize food items and recommend recipes, just like the previous-generation model. But now, the integrated Samsung Food app can also use \u201cVision AI\u201d to recognize dishes in photographs and generate recipes for you. Plus, you can connect the fridge to your Samsung Health profile to have the fridge customize recipes based on your dietary needs.\nVision AI is a bit limited at launch and will only recognize 33 food items to start. It still has plenty of other neat features, though \u2014\u00a0and let\u2019s not forget how cool that giant 32-inch Family Hub touchscreen is.\nYou can learn more about the Samsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator with AI Family Hub+ in Samsung\u2019s press release.\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra robot vacuum & mop\nMost new robot vacuums right now are similar to new smartphones. Genuine innovations are few and far between, but we get solid performance bumps each year. The newly announced Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is the best of both worlds. It offers significant strides in power and performance, plus a few first-of-their-kind features that take hands-free cleaning to the next level.\nFirst, some quick highlights from the specs. The new Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra features powerful suction that boosts up to 10,000Pa to ensure no dirt or dust is left behind. It also has a new voice assistant that works without a connected smart speaker, Matter support, and a newly upgraded camera that enables \u2014\u00a0you guessed it \u2014\u00a0AI-powered obstacle avoidance.\nAnother great upgrade is the new mopping system on the bottom, which adds a rotating mopping pad next to the regular vibrating mop that Roborock fans will recognize. The mops now can lift up to 20mm to avoid carpets and rugs, which is a considerable increase compared to some older models.\nAs for totally new features, two things instantly caught my eye.\nFirst, the rotating edge brush on the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is now mounted on an arm that can automatically extend as it cleans. That way, it can reach into corners, which no robot vacuum I\u2019ve tested can do.\nOn top of that, there\u2019s a version of the S8 MaxV that comes with a new \u201cRefill & Drainage System\u201d built into the base station. It connects to your home\u2019s water and drainage system so that you never need to worry about refilling your water tank for the mop. Needless to say, this version will need to be installed by a plumber.\nThe version with the regular base station can still auto-wash and auto-dry the mop pads, and it\u2019ll still refill your robot with clean water. But you\u2019ll need to fill the clean water tank from time to time, as you would with other flagship combo robots with similar features. Unlike comparable models from other brands, however, the S8 MaxV Ultra\u2019s base station has a nifty new automatic dispenser that adds floor cleaner each time it refills the robot\u2019s water tank.\nThe new Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra will be released later this year for $1,799.99. You can learn more on the Roborock website.\nRoborock Zeo One washer/dryer combo\nRoborock is one of the best brands in the world when it comes to cleaning your floors. Now, you\u2019ll want Roborock to start cleaning your clothes, too.\nThe Roborock Zeo One is an all-in-one washer/dryer combo machine that pulls double duty. It\u2019s part of a relatively new breed of laundry combo machines that are just beginning to proliferate. Needless to say, the concept is compelling: you pile a load of laundry into a single machine where it\u2019s washed and dried. But the Zeo One adds even more innovation to the mix.\nOne of my favorite features of the Roborock Zeo One is the smart dosing feature. Instead of adding detergent and fabric softener with each load, you can fill the reservoirs and go for months without worrying about adding anything to your laundry.\nThe Zeo One also dries clothes using much less heat than a conventional dryer. The \u201cZeo-cycle\u201d drying system uses a large honeycomb-shaped disc with more than 20,000 holes to absorb moisture. The machine uses sensors and an AI algorithm to monitor the drying system more than 100 times per minute. Also, by keeping the heat low, the machine prevents damage to delicate garments like wool sweaters.\nRoborock\u2019s Zeo One even collects lint and disposes of it automatically through a water line, so you never have to clear a lint trap.\nCheck out Roborock\u2019s website for more info on the Zeo One.\nAnker SOLIX F3800 home power system\nSo many companies have released electric home generators over the past few years. Of course, if you\u2019re familiar with Anker, you know it\u2019s the one company everyone was waiting for to see what they would bring to this space.\nNow, the wait is finally over.\nAt CES 2024, Anker introduced its new Anker SOLIX F3800 home power system. It\u2019s an ultra-high-quality, all-in-one power backup solution that supports 120V and 240V. It offers up to 12,000W of output, which means it can power multiple appliances simultaneously. No more unplugging your fridge when you want to cook with your electric oven in a blackout.\nA single SOLIX F3800 stores 3.8kWh of energy, which is enough to power the average home in America for one day. The system is expandable to up to 53.8kWh, which is enough to power the average house for two weeks.\nAnker\u2019s SOLIX F3800 offers all the features you might expect, along with the quality you know you\u2019ll get from an Anker product. Plus, it of course can be connected to solar roof panels to store electricity and cut down on your home energy bills.\nIt\u2019s also portable enough to toss into an RV so that you can power your portable appliances for days. It even has a built-in NEMA 14-50 connector and can charge an EV!\nLearn more about the new Anker SOLIX F3800 home power system on Anker\u2019s website.\nHP Spectre Fold laptop\nJust like TVs, CES is also known for all of the laptops that are shown off at the event each year. At CES 2024, one particularly intriguing laptop took center stage.\nUnlike most other laptop models on display at CES this year, the HP Spectre Fold doesn\u2019t try to lean heavily on AI. Instead, it leans on another hot trend in the tech industry: foldable displays. We\u2019re used to seeing them on smartphones, but HP\u2019s new laptop takes things to a whole new level.\nThe 17-inch 2.5K foldable touchscreen display folds in the middle, but that\u2019s only part of the story. There are actually four different modes that the Spectre Fold will operate in.\nYou can fold it in the middle and place a magnetic keyboard attachment over the bottom half to use it as a regular laptop with a 12.3-inch display. Or, the keyboard slides forward to expose an extra portion of the screen on the bottom. Additionally, you can fold it flat to have a massive 17-inch tablet, or use the built-in kickstand to stand it up and use it like a desktop computer.\nAs for specs, you\u2019ll find plenty of power in this sleek new foldable laptop. Highlights include an Intel Core i7-1250U chipset with \u201cTurbo Boost\u201d up to 4.7GHz, Intel Iris Xe graphics, 16GB of LPDDR5 RAM, 1TB of SSD storage, Wi-Fi 6E, Bluetooth 5.3, and up to 12.5 hours of battery life.\nThe HP Spectre Fold is already available for purchase with a list price of $4,999.99.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo robot vacuum & mop\nSamsung had so many announcements in store for us at CES 2024. That shouldn\u2019t come as much of a surprise. What did come as a bit of a surprise, however, is just how impressive the company\u2019s latest robot vacuum is.\nThe Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo robot vacuum and mop is the latest addition to a new breed of autonomous vacuum and mop combo devices. In addition to cleaning your home and automatically emptying their own dust bins, they also have self-cleaning features for the mop.\nIn the case of the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, Samsung has introduced a new Clean Station alongside this model. It sucks out all the dirt and dust, and also flushes out the dirty water before refilling the robot with clean water. Plus, it washes the robot\u2019s dual mop pads and uses hot air to dry them.\nRegarding features, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo is loaded with everything from powerful suction to AI-assisted obstacle avoidance. But the coolest cleaning feature has to be Samsung\u2019s new steam cleaning function.\nWhen the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo detects a stain, it goes back to the clean station to heat the mop pads with high temperature steam and water and then returns to the area. With powerful spinning mops at 170 RPM, it can actively scrub off even hardened stains. These result in highly effective autonomous cleaning that reduces user intervention in a variety of environments.\nNow for the bad news, which is twofold.\nFirst, Samsung hasn\u2019t announced a price, though you can expect it to be relatively high. The previous-generation Jet Bot AI Plus launched at $1,300; this new version is a significant upgrade. The previous model didn\u2019t even have built-in mopping, let alone all the other fancy features touted by the new version.\nSecond, don\u2019t expect the Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo to launch anytime soon. According to Samsung\u2019s press release, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo is \u201ccurrently in development and the features described above are subject to change.\u201d If this model\u2019s feature set isn\u2019t yet finalized, it likely won\u2019t start shipping for several months, at least.\nTCL 40 NXTPAPER smartphone\nSmartphones are boring right now. Yeah, I said it. We haven\u2019t really seen any dramatic design shifts since 2016 and 2017, when manufacturers began shifting to the all-screen designs that are now found on all phones.\nSure, some phones have foldable displays. That\u2019s neat and all, but you just end up with a bigger version of the same old smartphone design once the device is unfolded.\nThat\u2019s why the TCL 40 NXTPAPER smartphone is such a breath of fresh air.\nTCL\u2019s newly released smartphone was shown off at CES 2024 even though it has already been launched in several international markets. The 40 NXTPAPER is definitely one of the coolest and most innovative new smartphones I\u2019ve seen in a very long time.\nThis sleek new smartphone is packed full of power and nifty features. But the star of the show is obviously the 6.78\u2033 FHD+ 90Hz NXTPAPER display. It\u2019s a full-color Electronic Paper Display, the likes of which the world has never seen before on a smartphone.\nThis screen doesn\u2019t just look like paper. It actually feels like paper thanks to a special matte finish and anti-fingermark coating. It also offers benefits like reduced blue light and low power consumption. As a matter of fact, the display is so efficient that the TCL 40 NXTPAPER offers two full days of use per charge.\nCheck out the TCL website to learn more about the new TCL 40 NXTPAPER smartphone.\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G9 49\u2033 curved gaming monitor\nThe Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 monitor is perhaps the most coveted computer monitor out there right now. At CES 2024, Samsung unveiled a newly updated version of the Odyssey G9, and it\u2019s destined to become your next obsession. It\u2019s a favorite of gamers, video editors, stock traders, and more, and now it\u2019s better than ever, thanks to Samsung\u2019s 2024 update.\nSamsung\u2019s new-and-improved Odyssey OLED G9 curved gaming monitor carries the model number G95SD. Like its predecessor, the updated model sports a 49-inch curved ultra-wide display with a 32:9 aspect ratio. As for the resolution, you\u2019re looking at 5,120 x 1,440 pixels. Yes, it\u2019s basically two stunning OLED monitors side by side.\nNew OLED Glare-Free tech helps reduce reflections so that nothing distracts from those deep blacks and vibrant colors. And speaking of black, VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400 helps ensure that unlit black colors are as deep as possible, and that colors really pop.\nWhere connectivity is concerned, the new Odyssey G9 OLED monitor has two HDMI 2.1 ports, a USB hub, and one DisplayPort 1.4 input. It also has a new Samsung feature called Multi Control, which makes it easy to transfer content between devices when you have more than one supported device connected to the monitor.\nPricing and availability details haven\u2019t been announced yet, but you can learn more in Samsung\u2019s press release.\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nI absolutely love my wood pellet smoker. It adds a delicious smokey flavor to food that you simply cannot replicate without burning real wood. Right now, however, it\u2019s the dead of winter where I live in the Northeast. That means I have to go without smoked foods unless the weather starts to warm up, lest I freeze my butt off.\nThat used to be the case, at least.\nAt CES 2024, GE is showing off its new GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. Unlike most new products at the show in Vegas, this is one that you can actually buy right now.\nAs the name suggests, the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker is a wood pellet smoker that works indoors. No, you don\u2019t have to install some crazy filtration system to route the smoke out your window. Instead, this awesome appliance uses Active Smoke Filtration so that no smoke escapes the unit. Instead, it outputs heat so you can stay nice and toasty while you marvel at the delicious food it cooks up.\nThe GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker has six presets that include Brisket, Pork Ribs, Pork Butt, Chicken Wings, Chicken Breast, and Salmon. Of course, you can also use custom settings to smoke anything you want. There are also adjustable smoke settings so you can decide if you want a hint of smokey taste or full-blown BBQ flavor.\nGE\u2019s indoor smoker uses real wood pellets, of course, so you can also use the same pellets that you would in an outdoor smoker. It retails for $999, and you can learn more on the GE website.\nWithings BeamO\nWithings took to CES 2024 to unveil the new Withings BeamO \u2014\u00a0not to be confused with BMO. BeamO is a first-of-its-kind 4-in-1 health checkup device meant to replace four essentials that should be in every home. BMO, on the other hand, is a delightful sentient video game system from Adventure Time. But I digress.\nThe new BeamO combines an ECG, pulse oximeter, stethoscope, and thermometer into a single compact device. With it, you can monitor your heart and lung health, as well as your temperature.\nBeamO is a transformative multiscope device. Once, body temperature was the only health scan routinely taken at home. BeamO will revolutionize the measurement of the core vitals carried out during medical visits fromthe comfort of one\u2019s own home. This crucial data will provide a vital overview of overall health or warning signs of potential areas of concern. Instead of measuring these stats a couple of times a year in a clinical setting, it will be possible to assess them every day. BeamO will be the thermometer of the future, providing the ability to assess temperature and observe the state of the heart and lungs.\nAccording to Withings, the BeamO allows a user to give himself or herself a full checkup of body temperature, heart health, and lung health in less than one minute. Of course, a parent can also use the device to perform a checkup on a child.\nIn the future, the company says the device will also detect signs of infection and even possible cardiovascular issues such as atrial fibrillation (AfiB) once it receives FDA clearance.\nThe Withings BeamO will be released this coming June, and it will retail for $249.

Here's Why We Think So\nIt might even be worth the eye-popping price.\nA stand mixer with built-in scale suddenly seems like a no-brainer.\nWhen you're working through a baking project, getting the measurements right for both wet and dry ingredients is critical. Add too much flour or not enough water and you'll likely end up with cookies or bread that would make British Bake Off's\u00a0Paul Hollywood stare blankly into space -- or worse. With that in mind, GE Profile (an independent wing of GE) has engineered a smart mixer with a\u00a0built-in scale, and it has us wondering: What took so long?\nRead more: The New CES Gadget I Geeked Out on This Week Wasn't a Wireless TV or Bendy Tablet\nIn hopes to pull a little market share from KitchenAid -- a brand that dominates the stand mixer category -- GE Profile touted some intriguing updates to its high-powered stand mixer at\u00a0CES 2023, dubbing it the \"smartest stand mixer in the world.\" On Tuesday, GE Profile announced that the mixer was named a\u00a0CES Innovations Awards Honoree\u00a0in the Home Appliance category.\nSo what's smart about it? The GE Profile's 7-quart mixing bowl now doubles as a scale to perfectly measure wet and dry ingredients such as flour, sugar, eggs, milk, water and salt. The smart scale accounts for ingredients already in the bowl, after which you can simply zero out and move on to the next ingredient without having to do any quick math. As of now, no KitchenAid stand mixer features a built-in scale, although a separate smart scale and sifter attachment can be had for around $130.\nThe stand mixer also has a feature called Auto Sense, which works with select recipes to monitor changes in texture and viscosity through motor torque feedback to optimize speeds and turn off the motor in accordance. Similar technology has been popular in blenders for years, but now brings stand mixing near to a set-it-and-forget-it experience.\nGE's new smart mixer features dozens of guided recipes aimed at making you a more confident baker.\nSpeaking of select recipes, the GE Profile app is loaded with dozens of guided stand mixer-based recipes to help you try new bakes with confidence.\nAnd what smart appliance would be complete without hands-free voice control? The GE Profile mixer is fully compatible with Alexa and Google Assistant\u00a0so you can stop the blade or change speeds even when your hands are busy with another project or too sticky to touch the control panel.\nThe smart mixer retails for $1,000 and is currently available exclusively at Crate & Barrel\nFollow more of CNET's 2023 CES coverage here.\nKitchen and Household Guides\nAppliances"

It is designed for optimal smoke with custom controls and maximum flavor; this unique airflow system, along with tight gaskets and seals, keeps the smoke in the appliance and not in the kitchen. Making it so that you can actually use this indoors.\nGE Profile has added five adjustable smoke settings which will allow users to control the smoke levels until they find their ideal flavor. The customization will allow cooks to explore barbeque favorites and new recipes with ease. There are also six preset food options that will provide amazing results for brisket, pork ribs, pork butt, chicken wings, chicken breast, and salmon, using a heat source at the bottom of the appliance. Users are also able to customize their food and smoke settings for other foods of choice.\nBest of all, the Smart Indoor Smoker is dishwasher-safe. So you can remove the racks and drip trays and place them in the dishwasher to cook.\nWhen can you buy the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker?\nThis is one of those CES products that you\u2019d expect to be launching many months from now, if at all. But that\u2019s not the case here. GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker will be available nationwide in early January, with a suggested retail price of $999.\nThat\u2019s some pretty quick availability, and it might be the only CES product to launch in the same month as CES.\nCopyright \u00a92024 Android Headlines.
