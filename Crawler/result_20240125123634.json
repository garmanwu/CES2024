Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best wearable and fitness tech of CES 2024: from smart rings to AI coaches\nWomen-first tech and automatic glasses stood out at CES\nEvery year CES \u2013 the Consumer Electronics Show \u2013 introduces us to a treasure trove of innovative technologies, and that\u2019s no truer than in the fitness and wearables category. CES 2024 has been no different.\nAt last year\u2019s conference, we saw a displayless smartwatch, smart beds for athletes, and an at-home pee tester (kinda yucky, but potentially a handy health accessory).\nThis year we (thankfully) don\u2019t have toilet-based gadgets we want to highlight, but there are plenty of other fitness and wearable gadgets we\u2019ve loved finding out more about \u2013 and have even got hands-on time with to see if they can live up to the hype.\nHere are some of the best wearables and fitness tech from CES 2024 including a glove that counters Parkinson\u2019s tremors, fitness headphones with an in-built AI coach, and a smartwatch we could see surviving anything.\nSmartwatches at CES 2024\nThere\u2019s usually a handful of smartwatches on display at CES, typically sleek sophisticated-looking things that combine fitness tracking with an elegant electronic timepiece.\nThat\u2019s true of the newly announced Garmin Lily 2 which boasts a \u201cpetite, fashionable\u201d smartwatch design \u2013 coming in at just 20.6g \u2013 and a hidden display that shows a patterned background until tapped. It\u2019s also plenty useful with connected GPS \u2013 although no built-in GPS, which would have been a huge upgrade for runners and cyclists over the original Garmin Lily \u2013 as well as five days of battery life, sleep scores, menstrual cycle tracking, and a pulse oximeter for checking your blood oxygen levels. It\u2019s available now for $249.99 / \u00a3249.99, with Australia prices TBC.\nGarmin also launched the HRM-Fit heart rate monitor which has been tailored specifically for people who wear medium and high-support sports bras. It offers all the same real-time workout information tracking in a package that should be more comfortable for sports bra wearers than traditional Garmin heart rate monitors.\nIf you instead want a smartwatch that looks like it would survive a nuclear explosion there\u2019s the Casio G-Shock Rangeman GPR-H1000. It features heart rate monitoring, a pulse oximeter, built-in GPS, and Casio's Triple Sensor for measuring altitude, compass bearing, and temperature. Casio\u2019s smartwatch can also give you sunrise and sunset times, and global tide data making though it comes at a price. When it launches on January 20 it\u2019ll set you back $500 / \u00a3449 (around AU$750).\nSmart rings at CES 2024\nSmart rings are becoming all the rage \u2013 they\u2019re like fitness watches but pack all of their health-tracking sensors into a ring that\u2019s a lot less bulky and distracting.\nThe 4g Amazfit Helio ring is coming to claim Oura\u2019s crown at the top of our best smart rings list with its promises of detailed sleep tracking and readiness scoring that could help you improve your running and cycling workouts. Though to access its premium analysis features you\u2019ll need to pay $69.99 (approx \u00a375 / AU$105) per year.\nConversely, the women-first Evie smart ring offers a one-and-done approach. The ring is not only packed with helpful trackers for sleep, blood oxygen, and heart health, but it also has an AI that can look at this info as well as logs related to your menstrual cycle, mood, and activity levels to provide insight on what has positive impacts on your health \u2013 such as noting that the days you log more steps than average are days your mood is higher.\nIt even has an open ring design to account for the changes in women\u2019s finger sizes at different points in their menstrual cycle. The Evie smart ring launches later this January but only in the US for $269.\nFitness headphones at CES 2024\nMusic can be a powerful workout tool with powerful tunes helping you to push through a workout, or distract you from how tired you\u2019re feeling on your long run. But Mojawa\u2019s new bone conduction headphones want to take things further with an AI sports trainer who can help you take your training further, apparently.\nWith vibration-based training guidance Mojawa\u2019s HaptiFit Terra headphones\u2019 AI \u201celevate workouts into complete training sessions with automatically generated exercise plans.\u201d How this looks in practice is anyone\u2019s guess but when it launches in the next couple of months \u2013 the official release date is Q1 2024 \u2013 we should find out.\nThe gadget is currently on presale for $199.99 / \u00a3239.99 \u2013 slightly cheaper than the $299.99 retail price (Australian and UK release prices to come in the future). On top of the AI you\u2019ll get headphones with an IP68 water resistance rating and 32GB of on-board music storage that\u2019s controlled by pressure-sensitive haptic controls.\nSennheiser also introduced a new set of Momentum Sport headphones, with built-in fitness tracking and PPG heart rate sensor, as well as the full range of Polar's impressive fitness metrics. The Sport buds go on sale on the 9th of April with a selling price of $329.95 / \u20ac329.99 / around AU$492.14.\nHealth wearables at CES 2024\nThe most innovative health tech shown off at CES can be a total game changer for the people it helps. In the case of the GyroGlove it\u2019s helping to give people suffering from Parkinson's some of their independence back.\nBy working to counter her tremors Roberta Wilson-Garrett \u2013 a person with Parkinson\u2019s \u2013 told us that she can make herself a cup of tea, button her shirt, and eat something using utensils thanks to the FDA Class-1 approved glove. In a live demonstration, we saw a stark contrast between her ability to draw with and without the glove.\nThe GyroGlove is available to buy right now \u2013 though each hand will cost you $5,899 (around \u00a34,600 / AU$8.800) \u2013 but CES is also a chance to see the future of health tech, like the Vixion 01 specs.\nThis sci-fi visor isn\u2019t yet another Apple Vision Pro competitor. They\u2019re glasses that can automatically correct your vision so whatever you\u2019re looking at is always in focus. The clear advantage being you\u2019d only need to buy one pair of specs for the rest of your life. If your vision changes the Vixion 01 will adjust itself so you can still see with perfect clarity. The only downside is we don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll release, or how much it\u2019ll be at launch.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens. We'll be covering everything from\u00a08K\u00a0TVs and foldable displays to new phones, laptops, smart home gadgets, and the latest in AI, so stick with us for the big stories.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to\u00a0follow us on TikTok\u00a0for the latest from the CES show floor!\nYou might also like\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nHamish is a Senior Staff Writer for TechRadar and you\u2019ll see his name appearing on articles across nearly every topic on the site from smart home deals to speaker reviews to graphics card news and everything in between.

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nCES 2024 Preview: Innovations In Wearables And Health\nCES logo\nCES 2024 takes place from January 9 to January 12 in Las Vegas. It\u2019s a giant technology show where innovations across consumer and health tech are shown off.\nMore than 115,000 people came to the show in 2023, and 2024 is set to be even larger according to the official stats.\nThere will be plenty of surprises at the show, but some of the health tech and wearable-related tech there is already known. And there are clues as to some bits that have not been officially announced. Here are some of the most notable examples.\nWithings: Eye catching innovation?\nYou can hope for something intriguing from Withings, even if it will not appear on sale all that soon. At CES 2023, Withings showed the U-Scan, a headline-grabber of an announcement. The U-Scan is a urine analysis sensor designed to be mounted inside your toilet bowl. It can measure ketones, Vitamin C levels, water composition and acid base. One year on it\u2019s still listed as \u201ccoming soon\u201d on the Withings website. It has teased something equally compelling may be at CES 2024, tweeting \u201cthe dawn of our next revolution is imminent\u201d on December 22.\nFitbit: Luxe 2?\nWhile there is no major suggestion Fitbit has bit launch plans for CES 2024, there are some signs a Fitbit Luxe 2 is on the way. A wearable that, assuming there are no brand new lines in the works, must be either the Luxe 2 or an Ace 4, has passed through the FCC. Such a watch is likely to appear at some point in Q4 2024. However, will it come to CES? That is much less clear. The Fitbit Luxe arrived in 2021. And Fitbit has not seen many launches since Google\u2019s acquisition of the brand in January 2021.\nSo When Is The\nRebel Moon\nR Rated Snyder Cut s Release Date Then\nMassive California Waves Hospitalize At Least Eight And Cause Evacuations Along Pacific Coast\nThree Supermoons, Two Comets And The \u2018Great American Eclipse:\u2019 The Sky In 2024\nSamsung: Fit 3 incoming\nThe Samsung Fit 3 leaked in November and is expected to launch in January. It's more likely to be seen as part of confidential meetings at CES than a major public announcement, though, as Samsung will hold one of its big Unpacked events on January 18. That\u2019s just a few days after CES closes up shop. The watch\u2019s predecessor, the Galaxy Fit 2, arrived way back in 2020. This one has a much larger OLED screen, which should make it feel more like a smartwatch.\nRuah: Easier sleep apnea diagnosis\nRuahlab Inc.\u2019s Ruah wearable has received an innovation award from the CES CEA organisation even before the show begins. From a glance it looks a bit like a face mask worn only over the nose. However, it\u2019s an AI-powered device that monitors breathing patterns, in order to help diagnose sleep apnea. As such, it\u2019s a much more convenient alternative to polysomnography, which uses a multi-sensor polysomnogram to assess sleep abnormalities.\nAbbott: Glucose monitoring\nAccording to Wareable, Abbott plans to show its consumer-focused Lingo continuous glucose monitor tech at CES 2024. This means we could be getting closer to an expansion into the US. Lingo is already available in the UK, where it costs \u00a3150 (around $190) a month and is sold as \"the future of metabolism ownership.\u201d Lingo involves wearing a biosensor to monitor for glucose spikes.\nInception Lab: Bedsore diagnosis\nInception Lab is another winner of a CES innovation award. Its work is in the healthcare industry, but is a technology anyone can understand. It has made a bedsore sensor called Inception One. They are placed in \u201careas suspected of bedsores\u201d in order to help diagnose the problem without relying simply on a visual inspection.\nYou can expect news at CES to start pumping out from January 7, one of two \u201cMedia Days\u201d ahead of the show\u2019s opening."

It still comes with the textured lens which gives an attractive effect even when the screen is dimmed.\nNew additions for Lily 2 are new dance sport profiles, and the inclusion of the new Body Battery, sleep score, Morning Report, and Garmin Pay functionality (for the Classic model).\nGarmin HRM-Fit\nWareable\nThe launch of the Garmin HRM-Fit rounded out a female-focused CES for the fitness giant.\nThe heart rate monitor strap clips onto medium- and high-support sports bras \u2013 including those from Adidas, Athleta, NoBull, and Under Armour - and aims to solve the pain point with sports bras and traditional chest straps.\nAs you\u2019d expect, the HRM-Fit can connect to a range of Garmin watches and Edge cycling computers, and also feed features the full gamut of Garmin's Running Dynamics metrics.\nAmazfit Helios\nWareable\nA surprise smart ring from Zepp Health landed at CES \u2013 the Amazfit Helios. It's designed to complement the company's performande wearables, by focussing on recovery and physical/mental readiness.\nThe band itself is a slightly weight 4g, but offers 100ATM water resistance and comes in silver and gold options.\nIt also offers users the AI chatbot coaching options via a premoium tier level within the Zepp Health app.\nMovano Evie\nWareable\nThe long-awaited Evie is about to launch - and doesn't disappoint as a smart ring for women.\nThe unique design not only enables the band to slightly expand to fit perfectly even when the finger swells during the natural monthly cycle, but it also makes for an attractive smart ring that\u2019s easy to like.\nThe metrics and analysis are still quite basic, but the AI-powered insights will grow the longer you wear it. There\u2019s plenty to come from Movano, but users will need to be patient with this one.\nRead our hands-on with the Movano Evie.\nAbbott Lingo\nWareable\nFollowing a public preview period over the last few months, health company Abbott used CES 2024 to announce that its Lingo continuous glucose monitor (CGM) is now on sale in the UK.\nThe semi-invasive CGM comes as a single sensor for \u00a389 (or as a four-pack for \u00a3300), with users able to place it on their arm and use the companion app to monitor spikes and dips in their blood glucose.\nWhile it may appear to be a medical device targeted at diabetics, Abbott has instead talked up the Lingo as a wearable that everybody can use to form healthier habits relating to sleep, mood, focus, and energy.\nWe're looking forward to testing this one out once we get back across the pond.\nWithings BeamO\nWareable\nWithings is getting pretty used to introducing its bleeding-edge tech at CES, and this year was no different. The brand used CES 2024 to debut the BeamO - a rectangular-shaped device that provides four types of medical-grade readings from home.\nIt's able to take an electrocardiogram (ECG), read the user's temperature, view blood oxygen saturation, and act as a stethoscope to track heart rate and listen out for respiratory sounds.\nThe BeamO hasn't been cleared by medical regulators just yet, however, which is why no pricing or availability information has been released by Withings just yet.\nIt wins our award for the best-named product at CES this year, at least.\nLuxottica/Nuance Audio\nWareable\nThese smart specs \u2013 manufactured by EssilorLuxoticca, the owner of Ray-Ban \u2013 use beamforming technology to identify the person you're talkung to in a crowded room and amplify their voice.\nIt's aimed at people with mild to moderate hearing loss, who struggle to follow conversations in crowded environments. It also means that users don't have to wear conspicious earbuds, \u00a0or get fitted by an audiologist for hearing aids, with the associated stigmas.\nXREAL Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWareable\nThe XREAL Air AR glasses impressed us in our demo at Pepcom on day one of CES 2024.\nFollowing Apple's lead for spatial computijng, the glasses showed off high quality and impressive immersion of virtual objects, and reacted to physical controllers on the table top to switch between modes.\nWe navigated virtual desktops, video calling demos and even movie watching.\nSome elements were a little rudimentary and agricultural in their appliation \u2013 but by and large, an impressive demonstratioin of spatial computing in a relatively small pair of XR specs.\nInvoxia Minitailz\nWareable\nThis pet tracker caught the eye, with an AI element that's designed to track your pet's health and watch out for changes in their behavior.\nDesigned for cats and dogs (but arguably a little big for felines), the Minitailz monitors heart rate, scans for heart conditions including Afib, and looks for subtle changes in your pet's activity levels or behavior.\nIt's also a GPS tracker too, with a $8.99 monthly subscription.\nHow we test\nBy James Stables\nJames is the co-founder of\u00a0Wareable, and he has been a technology journalist for 15 years.\nHe started his career at Future Publishing, James became the features editor of T3 Magazine and T3.com and was a regular contributor to TechRadar \u2013 before leaving Future Publishing to found\u00a0Wareable in 2014.\nJames has been at the helm of Wareable since 2014 and has become one of the leading experts in wearable technologies globally. He has reviewed, tested, and covered pretty much every wearable on the market, and is passionate about the evolving industry, and wearables helping people achieve healthier and happier lives."

        "raw_content": "Wearable tech 2024: Predictions, devices and themes\nThe dawning of a new year is upon us \u2013 so fresh and full of opportunity. The decoratiions are down at Wareable towers and the serious business of CES 2024 is upon us.\nBut the path for 2024 is already becoming clear.\nCome with us on a journey through 2024 \u2013 and what to expect in the world of wearables.\nThe devices\nMovano Evie Ring\nWe won\u2019t have long to wait for overdue Evie Ring, which will land on fingers in 2024. The female-focussed smart ring is out to challenge Oura, which itself has gone big on women\u2019s health insights in the past 12 months.\nBut first and foremost, the Evie Ring needs to actually be a good wearable. The company has brilliant ideas about medical grade sensors and FDA approval, but it\u2019s a rookie organisation building its first device.\nWe\u2019re keen to put it through its paces \u2013 and will do so at CES.\nApple Watch X\nWareable\nAll the rumours are pointing to a special Apple Watch release in 2024, which will be the 10th anniversary of the smartwatch.\nA major design change is being touted, as well as new sensors for sleep apnea and blood pressure.\nApple will also need to overcome its patent battle with Masimo.\nAway from a specific device launch \u2013 we\u2019re also expecting to see something of a step change from Apple in terms of wellness tracking.\nIt\u2019s focused on big health metrics, but we do feel it lags as a wellness device, especially when you look at where Whoop, Oura and now Garmin have taken things. Expect a rebalancing this year.\nWhoop 5.0\nIt also seems likely that we will see a revised Whoop in 2024 \u2013 even if there are little rumors around this to date.\nThe current Whoop 4.0 landed in 2021, so it\u2019s overdue an update. As a simple vehicle for sensors, the hardware is relatively unimportant.\nHowever, we\u2019d love to see an upgrade of the heart rate sensor, and a boost in battery life.\nOura Ring Gen 4\nLikewise, the Oura Ring Gen 3 has also been out since 2021.\nIn that time, it hasn't sat still, and brought out the Oura Ring Gen 3 Horizon, an upgraded look.\nWhile Oura is still the leader of the smart ring space, the incumbent is now being challenged by the likes of the Evie Ring, Circular Ring Slim and Ultrahuman Ring Air.\nThose improvements only bring rivals to Oura's level of slimness and design.\nBut if Oura wants to stay one step ahead of the competition, it could do with slimming down its ring even further. It's still very chunky to wear, and not especially female-friendly. We'd love to see that change in 2024.\nSamsung Galaxy Ring\nThe smart ring market is one of the most interesting wearable tech sub-categories, but so far a major player hasn\u2019t made a meaningful contribution.\nSamsung has been dropping regular patents and trademarks for its own smart ring, and it feels like 2024 could be the year it's made official.\nWhile it seems unlikely that Samsung could hugely drive the category forward in terms of raw innovation \u2013 a wearable behemoth going in on smart rings would bring the category to the mainstream.\nApple Vision Pro\nWareable\nRemember that huge 'spatial computing' headset that Apple launched at WWDC? You know, the one with the virtual eyes and makes your laptop screen the size of a room? Well, that\u2019s going to be coming out this year.\nWhile it\u2019s a niche product, it will be interesting to see the splash, if any, this makes.\nAnd it will be equally interesting to see the effect it has on the rest of the AR/XR industry. If this sgement is going to break into the consumer conscioiusness, it probably should happen now.\nThe themes\nBlood pressure\nThe world of wearables and smartwatches has been waiting for a big new sensor to arrive \u2013 and it feels that blood pressure is the most likely for 2024.\nSamsung has an existing solution on the Galaxy Watch that must be verified with a cuff \u2013 and only works if you also have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone, so its appeal is limited.\nSmartwatches that can detect high/low blood pressure, and bring awareness out there to the millions of hypertension suffers, would be a huge force for good.\nIt\u2019s been touted for the Apple Watch X, but the technology is also being worked on across the wearables world. So it will be interesting who can bring the functionality, and also implement a helpful and insightful feature onto watches.\nIt will also mean navigating regulatory bodies to get sign off for use \u2013 so there are some big hurdles to navigate.\nSleep apnea\nSleep apnea got the limelight a few years ago, and Fitbit and Withings offer oxygen variation readings during sleep. However, the devices stop short of talking about sleep apnea, due to limitations of not being medical devices.\nWe\u2019d expect to see this area move forward, with more prescriptive detection of sleep apnea issues, on mainstream devices.\nIt's another feature that's been touted for the Apple Watch X, and we'd be surprised if it wasn't a major talking point of Samsung and Pixel Watch releases in 2024.\nBlood glucose\nWareable\nIt seems highly unlikely that we will see non-invasive blood glucose monitoring on devices this year. But we will certainly be closer by the time 2024 is over.\nThere\u2019s a host of companies with solutions that show promise, such as UK-based Afon, Movano\u2019s RF sensor, as well as Singapore-based Actxa.\nWhile a solution for type 1 diabetics might be unrealistic for now, something that could detect spikes, or unhealthy blood sugar levels for pre-diabetics, could have huge societal benefits.\nSo expect to see some meaningful progress this year.\nAI and wearables\nWareable\n2023 was truly the year of AI, and it\u2019s unlikely to change in 2024. However, we may see a move from impressive yet ultimately useless proof of concepts (such as ChatGPT don\u2019t @ me) to meaningful implementations.\nAnd the wearables industry will be a key area for that.\nThe potential of AI is to take all the disparate data points from our wearables and make something genuinely unique from them.\nThat could mean analyzing long-term heart rate trends, mixing in long term sleep data and lifestyle inputs, to tell you something you didn\u2019t know about yourself.\nThat\u2019s a big goal \u2013 and fraught with regulatory challenges. But expect to see the first seeds of that this year, probably led by Apple\u2019s Quartz platform.\nPatent war 2.0\nIt seems we are back to the era of the patent wars of the early wearables age \u2013 and there are plenty to keep tabs on.\nApple vs Masimo is clearly a hot topic, but Apple vs AliveCor is also ongoing.\nThen there\u2019s Oura vs. Ultrahuman and Circular.\nWatch this space for the full ramifications.\nHow we test\nBy James Stables\nJames is the co-founder of\u00a0Wareable, and he has been a technology journalist for 15 years.\nHe started his career at Future Publishing, James became the features editor of T3 Magazine and T3.com and was a regular contributor to TechRadar \u2013 before leaving Future Publishing to found\u00a0Wareable in 2014.\nJames has been at the helm of Wareable since 2014 and has become one of the leading experts in wearable technologies globally.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities.

Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Wearable tech products stealing the show this year\nAs CES 2024 concludes for another year, it\u2019s an opportune moment to look back at the health and fitness gadgets that made their mark at the event in Las Vegas, which took place between January 9th and 12th.\nCES stands as the world\u2019s most significant and influential technology event. For tech aficionados, it\u2019s an unparalleled experience. Its closest counterpart is IFA, held annually in Berlin at the start of September.\nHistorically, these expos have been pivotal in introducing technologies we now consider commonplace. This year, Fitbit, Fossil, and Xiaomi disappointed with no new announcements. Consistent with previous years, Apple did not participate. Nevertheless, wearables maintained a strong presence in 2024.\nThe event sprawled across 2.75 million square feet, featuring over 2,000 exhibitors. These included manufacturers, developers, and suppliers of consumer technology hardware and content. The conference program boasted more than 1,000 speakers. It\u2019s estimated that over 100,000 attendees visited the event.\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of our top wearable tech picks from the Las Vegas showrooms. These are just a handful of our favorites. Our comprehensive coverage of CES 2024 can be found on this link.\nAmazfit Helio Ring\nOur top pick this year is the Amazfit Helio Ring, a product by Zepp Health, marking their first venture into the realm of smart rings. This device is specifically designed for athletes, focusing on optimizing recovery and enhancing performance. Unlike typical smart rings that mainly track sleep for the general public, the Helio Ring provides in-depth insights into both mental and physical conditions, a feature particularly beneficial for athletes.\nThe Helio Ring\u2019s standout feature is its ability to convert complex health data into a simple Readiness score. By monitoring sleep heart rate, HRV, breathing, and body temperature overnight, the ring, in conjunction with the Zepp App, calculates this score to help athletes decide whether to focus on training or recovery. This aids in planning workouts more effectively. The ring also offers comprehensive sleep and recovery tracking, including analysis of sleep quality, sleep stages, and sleep breathing quality. Additionally, it features EDA emotional monitoring, which assesses physical signs like hand sweat to indicate emotional stress.\nMind you, this is not the only smart ring which made its appearance. Also there were RingConn with their excellent offering, along with Evie Ring, Velia Ring, YogiFi Ring and Dcare Ring. Its shaping up to be an exciting year for smart rings!\nWithings BeamO\nNext up on our list is the Withings BeamO, a groundbreaking health monitoring device that combines the futuristic vision of Star Trek with practical technology. BeamO allows users to perform a 4-in-1 health checkup, including body temperature, heart, and lung health, in under a minute.\nBeamO, the world\u2019s 1st multiscope for revolutionary at-home checkups, was unveiled at #CES2024 \u2014 our booth has been packed with people and the awards just keep coming.If you couldn\u2019t make it to CES or get through the crowds, here\u2019s PM Livia Robic with a personal demo for you. pic.twitter.com/LqZrk9ljzO\nThe thing functions as a thermometer, ECG, oximeter, and stethoscope, using photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodes for accurate readings. BeamO also features a non-contact temperature sensor and a digital stethoscope with a Piezoelectric disc for detailed heart and lung assessments. The data syncs with the Withings Health app, providing insights and enabling telehealth consultations.\nPriced at $249.95 the device is set to be available in June 2024. BeamO is recognized as a CES Innovations Award Honoree and represents a significant advancement in home health monitoring technology.\nGarmin Lily 2\nAnother standout device from CES 2024 is the Garmin Lily 2, a successor to the original Garmin Lily launched in 2021. The Lily 2 retains the stylish and functional appeal of its predecessor but introduces several notable upgrades. It features an improved heart rate sensor, new fitness modes, and NFC payments.\nDesign-wise, the model retains a classic round shape, but the Lily 2 upgrades the build to anodized aluminum for enhanced durability and sophistication. The Lily 2 also simplifies band switching with a more standard lug design. As before, there\u2019s a TFT LCD with 16-level grayscale on-board. The Lily 2 stands out with its Gen 4 Elevate sensor, improving health and fitness tracking, and introduces NFC for contactless payments, a feature absent in the original Lily. Priced slightly higher than the original, the Lily 2 offers a blend of fashion, functionality, and fitness tracking, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a stylish, compact wearable.\nGarmin HRM-Fit\nAlso among our favorite picks from CES 2024 is the Garmin HRM-Fit, a heart rate monitor specifically designed for women. Priced at $150, it offers a snug fit and is compatible with medium to high support sports bras, accommodating a variety of body types. Its design ensures stability and comfort during intense workouts, although it\u2019s advised not to use it with certain types of bras like longline, front zip, and light support variants.\nFunctionally, the HRM-Fit excels in providing precise heart rate data, surpassing the accuracy of wrist-based devices. It supports advanced workout tracking, including metrics like vertical oscillations, ground contact time, and stride length, crucial for detailed running form analysis. With a battery life of up to one year (based on daily one-hour usage) and water resistance up to 50 feet, it\u2019s built for endurance and versatility.\nNowatch hybrid\nNowatch, a Dutch startup, has evolved from a mindful health tracker to a sophisticated hybrid smartwatch, showcased at CES 2024. The original Nowatch, known for its stress prediction using an electrodermal sensor (EDA), has now incorporated Chronos \u2018timepiece faces\u2019, adding the functionality of time display while maintaining its focus on mindfulness and stress awareness.\nThe AI Insights feature provides daily summaries and recommendations based on the wearer\u2019s stress data, sleep, and activity stats. The design of Nowatch, featuring interchangeable discs made of polished metal and gemstones, emphasizes wearability and style. This evolution marks Nowatch\u2019s journey in the wearable technology space, focusing on aesthetics, mindfulness, and a user-customizable experience.\nUltrahuman Home\nUltrahuman has introduced Ultrahuman Home at CES 2024, a device that tracks and enhances the health of living spaces. This innovative product extends Ultrahuman\u2019s wearable tech expertise to environmental health monitoring. It provides insights into factors like artificial light, air quality, humidity, and noise levels, correlating them with individual lifestyle factors such as sleep and stress.\nIntroducing Ultrahuman Home! It is a sleek yet powerful device that will provide insights on an individual's external environment including exposure to artificial light, air quality, humidity and noise levels. It\u2019s a first for the wearable space to leverage home health data and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SV33UHFp2q\nUltrahuman Home offers a longitudinal view of environmental markers and their impact on health over time, featuring capabilities like natural light spectrum monitoring, PM detection, noise detection, humidity level monitoring, and blue light exposure monitoring. Set to launch on Kickstarter for USD $349, Ultrahuman Home represents a novel approach to integrating personal and environmental health monitoring.\nMomentum Sport Earbuds\nThe Sennheiser Momentum Sport Earbuds, a result of the collaboration between Polar and Sennheiser, were also introduced at CES 2024. These earbuds combine Sennheiser\u2019s renowned sound quality with Polar\u2019s advanced fitness tracking technologies. They feature a semi-open design, active noise cancellation, and an anti-wind mode, making them ideal for outdoor activities. With an IP55 rating for moisture and dust resistance, they promise up to six hours of battery life.\nUnique to these earbuds is the integration of Polar\u2019s Flow data analytics, which includes a photoplethysmography (PPG) heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor for efficient workout planning. Priced at $329.95, they offer a comprehensive workout experience, combining high-quality audio with sophisticated fitness tracking.\nLike\u00a0this article?\u00a0Subscribe to our monthly newsletter\u00a0and\u00a0never miss out!\nMarko founded Gadgets & Wearables in 2014, having worked for more than 15 years in the City of London\u2019s financial district.

Here\u2019s how it works.\n5 trends that will define wearables in 2024 and beyond\nFrom on-the-wrist AI to improved fitness tracking for Fido, here's what to watch\nCES 2024 is right around the corner, which means this is the perfect time to make predictions about which tech wearable trends will be most noteworthy this year. With no shortage of exciting new devices rumored to be on the horizon \u2014 including an Apple Watch 10, Pixel Watch 3 and Oura Ring 4 \u2014 \u00a0there\u2019s much to look forward to.\nBy the way, I\u2019m not talking brighter screens, better battery life or a wider array of styles and designs \u2014 every refresh of the calendar comes with those expected spec bumps. What follows are the major features, functions and trends that I believe will set 2024's tech wearables apart from years prior.\n1. AI everywhere, including on your wrist\nWhile some consumer tech brands will talk the talk, others will walk the AI walk.\nAI is the buzzword of the moment. In 2024, it will lose all meaning thanks to overuse by desperate corporate marketing departments. But don't worry about that. While some consumer tech brands will talk the talk, others will walk the AI walk earnestly by meaningfully incorporating AI-based features into products.\nWindows is bringing a dedicated AI chatbot button to future desktop keyboards. What might AI integration look like for tech wearables? We will find out soon. The Black Shark S1 Pro, a smartwatch built for hardcore gamers, will launch soon with ChatGPT Voice support built-in, likely allowing users to accomplish an enormous range of tasks via voice \u2014 far more than what Alexa, Google Assistant or Siri currently offer.\nWith ChatGPT Voice now available to the masses for free, we will undoubtedly see other smartwatch makers rush to incorporate the feature successfully.\nOn the fitness tracking side, expect major players like Apple, Google and Garmin to continue leveraging AI-powered processing \u2014 under the hood \u2014 to get the most out of user data. This could potentially lead to better fitness tracking accuracy, improved screening for health anomalies and more personalized workout and recovery recommendations.\n2. A greater focus on non-wrist-based wearables\nThe Oura Ring is one of the most popular smart rings on the market, with a focus on fitness, sleep and recovery tracking. Unlike most standard fitness devices, such as Fitbits and Apple Watches, it is rather unassuming \u2014 to the casual observer, the Oura appears to be nothing more than an ordinary stainless steel band.\n2024 will likely bring with it a refresh of the current Oura Ring to Generation Four. We suspect the new device will have a thinner design, additional health-centric features and possibly even support for digital payments.\nSamsung also appears set to launch its own smart ring soon (maybe even next week). Our look at the rumored Samsung Galaxy Ring has more on that device.\nA new flagship Movano Evie Ring should also be dropping in 2024, with an even greater focus on women\u2019s health tracking. And unlike the Oura Ring Gen 3, the updated Evie likely will not require a monthly subscription.\nWill we see smart ring releases from more big tech players, like Apple or Google? Possibly. The smart ring market is still small but definitely growing.\n3. Improved monitoring for serious health conditions\nMost modern smartwatches keep tabs on sleep quality, stress levels and heart rate. Many models also sport onboard ECG sensors to monitor for signs of an irregular heartbeat that might indicate a user has atrial fibrillation or AFIB, a potentially deadly condition.\nIn 2024, new smartwatches will monitor for an even wider range of serious health conditions, including hypertension and sleep apnea. Both are silent killers that can go unnoticed, potentially leading to heart failure or stroke.\nThe next-generation Apple Watch 10, for instance, is tipped to scan for signs of hypertension using some form of wrist-based blood pressure monitoring. Meanwhile, sleep apnea alerts could be generated when major disturbances in breathing patterns are detected.\nApple, of course, is not the only brand we expect to roll out improved health monitoring tech. The forthcoming Samsung Galaxy Watch 7 will also likely boast on-wrist blood pressure readings, pending FDA approval in the US.\n4. A wider selection of health wearables for pets\nWhile subscription-based GPS dog collars have been around for a while, pet wearables focused solely on monitoring health \u2014 including physical activity, diet and sleep \u2014 are becoming more common.\nFitBark, for instance, sells its device with and without an onboard GPS. The latter is a one-and-done purchase of $69. The UK-based brand PitPat similarly sells its dog activity monitor in two varieties, depending on your needs and tolerance for subscription pricing.\nIn 2024, expect to see a wider selection of pet health-tracking wearables come to market, both in the form of collars and collar accessories. Also, be on the lookout for traditional tech companies making the jump into pet wellness. What might a \u201cFitbit Woof\u201d look like \u2014 how about the \u201cApple iDog\u201d collar?\nUltimately, pets are big business \u2014 in 2022, Americans spent more than $136 billion on their furry friends alone \u2014 and big tech loves big market opportunities.\n5. A continuing cascade of legal disputes\nLast but not least, 2024 will surely be another action-packed year of legal disputes over intellectual property, stolen trade secrets, copyright infringement and more.\nApple is presently in the middle of a multi-year legal battle over its blood oxygen monitoring tech, which may or may not reach its grand finale in 2024. And that is just one of several patent kerfuffles facing the Cupertino giant. Another medical device maker, AliveCor, has also accused Apple of patent theft. That case is pending but will likely see a conclusion soonish.\nAnother doozy to keep an eye on is the recent copyright infringement lawsuit by the New York Times against OpenAI, maker of the popular AI-based ChatGPT. More specifically, the Times says OpenAI trained its bots using copyrighted material. The verdict could have wide-reaching implications on how and when artificial intelligence features are adopted in popular tech wearables.\nThese are just a few of the significant tech-related legal battles likely to play out in 2024. Expect countless more lawsuits, both frivolous and legit, to unfold in the coming 12 months.\n2024 tech wearable trends: What else?\nAnd there you have it \u2014 an entire year of wearable tech trends summed up in one concise article. Of course, these aren't the only ones to be on the lookout for. This is where you come in. What trends do you think will have the greatest impact on smartwatches, fitness trackers and wearable tech in 2024?

        "raw_content": "10 wearables (and health devices) you might have missed at CES 2024\nCES 2024 has now come to a close, and we need a well-earned rest after a week of chasing down wearables across downtown Las Vegas.\nHighlights were the Movano Evie, new Garmin Lily 2, and some promising consumer smart glasses.\nBut the halls of the Expo were full of interesting wearables, far too many to report individually.\nRead on for some of the wearables you might have missed from this year's show.\nVuzix Ultralite S\nWareable\nA follow-up to the Ultralite and new for CES 2024, the sportier-looking Ultralite S also features an incognito mode so people can\u2019t see the text or visuals through the front of the smartglasses.\nVuzix is still focused on the enterprise market, although Ultralite is an OEM product that companies could use as the basis of consumer products.\nWe got to try the Ultralite S on the show floor and had a variety of demos including turn-by-turn directions, text-to-speech, and translations.\nThe Ultralite S is seriously impressive in terms of the form factor, but still very basic in the quality of the heads-up display visuals. It\u2019s also quite hard to focus on the text, and I closed one eye to read long passages of text.\nPete Jameson, COO of Vuzix revealed to Wareable that it was working on a microLED solution that would be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for smart eyewear \u2013 which was still \u201ca year and a half\u201d away.\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nWareable\nSennheiser announced the Momentum Sport, a brand new pair of heart rate monitoring headphones, which use Polar algorithms to track your workout performance.\nThe Powered By Polar device features an optical heart rate sensor, and temperature sensor and broadcasts over Bluetooth, so it can be used by Pelotons, smartwatches and your smartphone.\nBut you can plug them into Polar Flow, and get performance analytics such as Training Load Pro, Training Benefit, and even body temperature measurements.\nStelo by Dexcom\nWareable\nWith Abbott getting into consumer CGMs with Lingo, it's no surprise that Dexcom has its product coming too. It's launched Stelo, a pared-back version of its G7 CGM, which is designed for Type 2 diabetics to understand their glucose levels. The app will track spikes and provide insights into the foods that cause high blood sugar.\nNextSense earbuds\nWareable\nThe NextSense project was born out of Google X, which certainly caught our eye \u2013 and it\u2019s led to two different products. The original project was a pair of EEG earbuds designed to offer an early warning for epileptic seizures.\nThat will be a few years away, but the same technology is being used for the NextSense sleep earbuds.\nThe same EEG tech will read your brain evaluate your sleep strategies, and enable users to work out the best way to get decent sleep. The EEG can power sleep sounds and soundscapes but also inform users about the effectiveness of treatments such as melatonin.\nIt's set to launch at the end of 2024.\nInvoxia Minitailz\nWareable\nThis pet tracker is a GPS tracker for dogs and cats \u2013 that also acts as a fitness tracker and wellness monitor. It tracks heart rate, will detect Afib, and also uses AI to warn if your pet\u2019s behaviour is changing. It can be retrofitted to your pet\u2019s existing collar.\nAmira Terra\nWareable\nThis menopause wearable will detect hot flashes from the wrist and track them within the partner app. There\u2019s also a cooling element, which uses cold water to chill a pad, which can be placed on a bed or seat to cool the body until the feeling passes and aid in better sleep.\nIdentifyHer\nIrish startup IdentityHer uses a stick-on sensor to track the symptoms of menopause. The sensor sticks to the chest, and tracks key menopausal symptoms, without the need for self-reporting.\nThe mix of sensors will track temperature, hot flashes, anxiety, and sleep. With so little research into menopause, IdentifyHer aims to help women manage their symptoms, and assess the effectiveness of treatment packages faster.\nMindLink Air\nWareable\nThese eye-tracking glasses from Canadian start-up AdHawk are designed to track the health of the brain.\nCapturing eye movements, the Mindlink Air glasses will record eye behavior and movement, blink activity, pupil dilation, gaze behavior, fixation depth, and fixation depth.\nVia the app, Mindlink will report on mental focus, and cognitive load and even assess your reading speed.\nBenzamin AI sleep controller\nBenzamin\nThis South Korean startup puts a sensor under your mattress to detect vital signs during sleep.\nThat might not sound particularly innovative, but there\u2019s more than meets the eye.\nAs well as detecting heart rate, breathing rate, and other metrics via vibrations through the mattress, it will also vibrate back, syncing to your heart rate, which it claims can boost autonomic system activity by 146% and parasympathetic nervous system activity by 116%.\nWhat does all that mean? Better sleep \u2013 but only if you live in South Korea because that's where it's launching first.\nErgoSportive smart bed\nWareable\nThis connected bed base turns your existing mattress into a smart bed and can hook up to your Garmin smartwatch. The bed base can track heart rate and respiration rate, tracking your sleep in real-time and manipulating the mattress to aid your rest. Examples could include lifting the mattress under the head if you\u2019re snoring.\nInterestingly, the bed is part of the Garmin Connectable program. That means it will populate Garmin Connect with sleep metrics if you don\u2019t want to wear your smartwatch to bed.\nHow we test\nBy James Stables\nJames is the co-founder of\u00a0Wareable, and he has been a technology journalist for 15 years.\nHe started his career at Future Publishing, James became the features editor of T3 Magazine and T3.com and was a regular contributor to TechRadar \u2013 before leaving Future Publishing to found\u00a0Wareable in 2014.\nJames has been at the helm of Wareable since 2014 and has become one of the leading experts in wearable technologies globally.

        "raw_content": "ESPN\nAs the Washington Football Team's QB quest enters Year 29, ESPN Analytics ranks its past 30 starters\nASHBURN, Va. -- On Sunday, Ryan Fitzpatrick became the Washington Football Team's 31st starting quarterback since Mark Rypien left the lineup in Week 2 of the 1993 season.\nFitzpatrick left Washington's 20-16 loss against the Los Angeles Chargers with a hip injury after attempting six passes and was placed on injured reserve with a chance to return later this season. Backup Taylor Heinicke was named the starter for Thursday's game against the visiting New York Giants (8:20 p.m. ET, NFL Network), a situation that is emblematic of the franchise's quest for a long-term answer at the position.\nIt's a 29-year search that has featured bad timing, worse luck and questionable decisions.\nRypien, who led the team to victory in Super Bowl XXVI after the 1991 season, started 26 games over the next two years but never rekindled his winning magic. Washington has since used first-round draft picks on five quarterbacks (Heath Shuler, Patrick Ramsey, Jason Campbell, Robert Griffin III and Dwayne Haskins), acquired three who started in Super Bowls for other teams (Jeff Hostetler, Donovan McNabb and Rex Grossman), and watched two others (Brad Johnson and Rich Gannon) do so after leaving the team. It also had a transformative quarterback (Griffin) who starred as a rookie, got hurt and was gone from the franchise three years later.\nEditor's Picks\nTaylor Heinicke is a 'tough dude' who energizes Washington Football Team2yJohn Keim\nFantasy fallout: Deebo Samuel is for real; Elijah Mitchell is 'for now'2yMike Triplett\nWhy the New York Giants remain all-in on Daniel Jones as QB12yJordan Raanan\nAs Washington closes on the 30th anniversary of its last Super Bowl win, ESPN set out to rank the 30 quarterbacks who started for the franchise between Rypien and Fitzpatrick, to provide context about the search for a leader that has touched four decades.\nAs a reporter who has covered 28 of the 30 players on this list -- and after interviewing nearly two dozen people, including former Washington coaches and teammates -- arriving at an irrefutable ranking for me was challenging. Several of these quarterbacks barely touched the field with Washington, while others faced obstacles such as coaching staffs that didn't want them, schemes that didn't fit their talents or injuries.\nWe enlisted the help of ESPN Analytics to apply a sense of order. That ranking (explained below) isn't perfect, but it does highlight the volatility of Washington's quest.\nNo quarterback since Rypien has made more than 60 starts for this franchise. Only two -- Kirk Cousins and Jason Campbell -- topped 50 starts, and 12 made five or fewer. Heck, receiver Terry McLaurin has played 30 games in Washington and caught passes from seven quarterbacks.\nMORE: A timeline of Washington Football Team's controversy and comebacks\nDuring Washington's search, its NFC East rivals have enjoyed long stretches of stability at the position. The Dallas Cowboys have had three quarterbacks (Troy Aikman, Tony Romo and Dak Prescott) start at least 70 games; Eli Manning started 234 for the New York Giants; and from 2000 to 2012, the Philadelphia Eagles had Donovan McNabb (10 seasons) and Michael Vick (three seasons) combine for 172 starts over that span.\nThe turnover has hurt the quality of QB play for Washington, which has had two postseason wins since Rypien's last full season in 1992. Nobody knew the frustration better than right tackle Jon Jansen, who played with 10 starting quarterbacks from 1999 to 2008.\n\"[When there's] constant change at quarterback,\" Jansen said, \"you don't ever get a chance to develop a rhythm and develop the relationship you need on the field.\"\nHere is our analytics-based ranking, presented in order from the back of the pack at No. 30 to the best at No. 1. Included are thoughts from ESPN draft analyst Mel Kiper Jr. on the five QBs who were first-round draft picks by Washington.\nNote: ESPN Analytics ranked the QBs according to a combination of regular-season passing efficiency (yards per attempt), weighted 75%, and total passing yards, weighted 25%. Players with few appearances (fewer than 1,000 passing yards) were ranked below those with more significant appearances and sorted solely by total passing yards. To account for the changing nature of the NFL's passing game, yardage and efficiency were adjusted according to the years in which they occurred.\n* Games and record totals include playoff appearances with Washington.\n30. Mark Sanchez (2018)\nGames: 2 | Record: 0-1 | TDs: 0 | INTs: 3 | Pass yards: 138\nWithin two weeks of signing, he became the starter after Colt McCoy was injured. Sanchez's lone start was disastrous: He completed 6 of 14 passes for 38 yards and two interceptions. He was benched for the second half and never played in the NFL again.\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him at No. 28 but acknowledge that his one half was one of the worst in recent memory.\n29. Taylor Heinicke (2020-present)*\nGames: 3 | Record: 0-1 | TDs: 2 | INTs: 0 | Pass yards: 259\nOn Dec. 7, he was a student at Old Dominion taking math classes. A day later he signed with Washington, and a month later he started a playoff game against Tom Brady and the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Heinicke entered the 2021 season as Fitzpatrick's backup, with a multiyear contract and strong fan support. He has an opportunity to climb this list, starting Thursday.\nKeim's take: There's no doubt he belongs higher, but this is indicative of how few snaps he has taken in Washington.\n28. Cary Conklin (1990-93)\nGames: 5 | Record: 0-2 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 3 | Pass yards: 512\nConklin, a fourth-round draft pick in 1990, appeared in seven NFL games, including two with the San Francisco 49ers. His lone starts occurred during Washington's 1993 season, when it finished 4-12.\nKeim's take: I'm fine with him here.\n27. Josh Johnson (2018)\nGames: 4 | Record: 1-2 | TDs: 3 | INTs: 4 | Pass yards: 590\nBecause of multiple injuries, Johnson made his first start 11 days after signing in December 2018. Said former coach Jay Gruden: \"We knew he could run. He wasn't the greatest passer, but he had a skill the other guys didn't have. [Mark] Sanchez had more experience but couldn't move.\"\nJohnson learned his Washington teammates by playing the Madden video game after signing.\nKeim's take: Too low for me; I would have put him at No. 21.\n26. Kyle Allen (2020-present)\nGames: 4 | Record: 1-3 | TDs: 4 | INTs: 1 | Pass yards: 610\nIn his four starts, he posted a Total QBR of 70 or better three times. Washington had only one other quarterback (Alex Smith) post a 70 rating or better in 2020. A broken ankle ended Allen's season.\nKeim's take: He was better than a few players ahead of him, which is why I would have ranked him No. 19.\n25. Rich Gannon (1993)\nGames: 8 | Record: 1-3 | TDs: 3 | INTs: 7 | Pass yards: 704\nGannon wasn't healthy in Washington.\n\"I told him, 'I could sit flat-footed and throw the ball farther than you,'\" said former running back Brian Mitchell, who played quarterback in college. \"When he played here, he did not have the same arm he did when he was in Oakland. It was nowhere close.\"\nHere's why: Gannon needed shoulder surgery and missed all of 1994. From 1999 to 2002, he led the Raiders to a Super Bowl, was named NFL MVP once, earned All-Pro twice and threw 105 touchdowns to 44 interceptions.\nKeim's take: Close; I would have ranked him No. 24, so there's agreement on his lack of effectiveness with Washington.\n24. Danny Wuerffel (2002)\nGames: 7 | Record: 2-2 | TDs: 3 | INTs: 6 | Pass yards: 719\nThe beginning of the end for coach Steve Spurrier in Washington occurred when the front office, against his strong wishes, cut Wuerffel before the 2003 season. Spurrier was shown statistics the night before cuts to convince him it was the right move. Wuerffel never played again.\nKeim's take: He just didn't have the arm to play in the NFL.\n23. John Beck (2011)\nGames: 4 | Record: 0-3 | TDs: 2 | INTs: 4 | Pass yards: 858\nFormer coach Mike Shanahan once said he would stand on a table to advocate for Beck. Players would not. During the 2011 lockout, Beck organized workouts.\nMore Than An Athlete: Michael Strahan\nFrom modest beginnings abroad, to NFL football superstardom, to media mogul, explore how Michael Strahan redefined the possibilities for modern athletes. Stream on ESPN+\nSaid former Washington tight end Chris Cooley: \"What I remember is he called everyone and said, 'This is John Beck, your starting quarterback.' We all called each other and said, 'Is he the starting QB or just saying that?' I didn't hate the confidence.\"\nBut it didn't translate to games. His last two starts were disasters: He was sacked 10 times in a shutout loss against the Buffalo Bills because he wouldn't throw the ball.\n\"He panicked,\" Cooley said.\nThe next week he dumped the ball off to running back Roy Helu 14 times and averaged 5.4 yards per pass attempt. In those games, Beck posted Total QBRs of 11.3 and 25.8, respectively.\n\"He thought he was going to be the guy,\" former receiver Santana Moss said. \"He sucked ass; I won't lie to you. I broke my hand and didn't play the [final two] games with him. Nothing better could have happened to me, because I didn't have to play with this guy. ... You talk all this stuff in the offseason and lay this egg.\"\nBeck never played again but has transformed himself into a quarterback teacher, training players for the NFL.\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him No. 30 based on the eye test and also with input from a number of ex-players.\n22. Jeff Hostetler (1997)\nGames: 6 | Record: 2-1 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 10 | Pass yards: 899\nThe former Super Bowl winner with the New York Giants finished his 12-year career by starting the last three games of 1997. His lone defeat was a crushing four-interception, 30-10 loss to the Giants in Week 16.\nKeim's take: This is the right area for him.\n21. Shane Matthews (2002)\nGames: 8 | Record: 3-4 | TDs: 11 | INTs: 6 | Pass yards: 1,251\nOne week after scoring 14 points in a win, Spurrier was determined to prove the value of his passing game. In a return to Florida for Spurrier and Matthews, facing the Jacksonville Jaguars' No. 21-ranked run defense and No. 13 pass defense, Matthews threw 50 passes and Washington lost by 19. In seven starts, he completed under half of his throws four times.\nKeim's take: Like Hostetler, Matthews is ranked where he needs to be.\n20. Tim Hasselbeck (2003-04)\nGames: 7 | Record: 1-4 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 7 | Pass yards: 1,012\nHe recorded the only 0.0 passer rating in franchise history, completing 6 of 26 passes for 56 yards with four interceptions in a 27-0 loss to Dallas. But that was sandwiched between games in which he had ratings of 128 and 116.9.\nKeim's take: That 0.0 game stands out, which is why some pegged him last. For me, he would be ranked No. 29.\n19. Dwayne Haskins (2019-20)\nGames: 16 | Record: 3-10 | TDs: 12 | INTs: 14 | Pass yards: 2,804\nWashington had him rated as a third-round draft pick in 2019, but multiple sources said higher-ups made them give Haskins a first-round grade and the team drafted him No. 15 overall. It was a bad marriage: Washington's staff needed to win, but Haskins needed time to mature.\nHis game didn't improve, and his maturity level was an issue for two coaching staffs and the front office. He missed one victory formation snap because he was taking a picture with a fan; he didn't study the way the coaches wanted; he was fined multiple times in 2020 for violating COVID-19 protocols, stripped of his captaincy and eventually cut.\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him at No. 25, but some of that ranking stems from the disappointing way he approached being an NFL quarterback.\nKiper's take on Haskins (2019 first-round draft pick, No. 15 overall): He's a pocket guy, big strong-armed guy. It made sense: local guy sliding down. He fell in their lap. It's like Mac Jones falling in New England's lap or Aaron Rodgers falling into Green Bay's lap. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.\nI don't think you can look back and say it was a horrible pick. In hindsight, yeah, but not when it was made. There were always questions with Dwayne: Are you going to be the first one in the building, the last one out? How much does he love the game? Does he study the game? What kind of leader is he? How do his teammates feel about him?\n18. Alex Smith (2018-20)\nGames: 18 | Record: 11-5 | TDs: 16 | INTs: 13 | Pass yards: 3,762\nThe key stat: During his time in Washington, the team was 6-27 when he didn't start. Washington was 6-3 when he suffered his broken fibula and tibia in 2018, then lost 18 of the next 22 games.\n\"Take any franchise and take away Derek Carr, Aaron Rodgers, Tom Brady and see what happens to them,\" Gruden said of losing Smith. \"Not many teams can recover.\"\nSmith's improbable return in 2020 helped deliver an NFC East title as the team went 5-1 in games he started (and 2-8 when he didn't).\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him in the top five. He and Mark Brunell were similar, so this is way too low for Smith.\n17. Heath Shuler (1994-96)\nGames: 19 | Record: 4-9 | TDs: 13 | INTs: 19 | Pass yards: 2,403\nWashington selected him at No. 3 in 1994 instead of Trent Dilfer (No. 6 overall) because of his mobility, even though it had Dilfer rated higher. Shuler's new teammates were not impressed.\nEli's Places\nEli Manning takes on his own version of his brother's signature show to explore what makes college football a way of life across the country. Join Eli as he travels to some of the most well-known and historic college football establishments and meets with giants in the sport to better understand what makes college football such a national sensation. Stream on ESPN+\nSaid Mitchell: \"We played a game in Kansas City [in 1995], and we called a waggle pass. He called it the wrong way, and it got f---ed up in the backfield. I was asked by a coach why I didn't help him out, and I said, 'If you want to pay me quarterback money, I'll call plays and play quarterback.'\"\nAfter the 1996 season, the Green Bay Packers and New Orleans Saints called about a trade. The Packers were coached by Mike Holmgren, and Washington's front office told Shuler it would be a better fit: He could learn and rebuild his game. Shuler wanted to play immediately and chose the Saints and coach Mike Ditka. He started nine games, suffered a serious foot injury and never played again.\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him No. 15, but this ranking by ESPN Analytics probably better reflects his performance. However, he should never be ahead of Smith.\nKiper's take on Shuler (1994 first-round draft pick, No. 3 overall): Second-guessing the Heath pick? You can't do it now. I got it wrong. I had no problem with Washington taking him at that point. If I was the Colts [at No. 5], I would have taken Trent Dilfer. Trent turned out to be a lot better than Heath, but I don't think you can question that pick.\n16. Case Keenum (2019)\nGames: 10 | Record: 1-7 | TDs: 11 | INTs: 5 | Pass yards: 1,707\nHe ended up starting in 2019 because McCoy was hurt and Haskins wasn't ready. He's a quality NFL backup with 75 career touchdown passes to 47 interceptions.\nKeim's take: No problem with this ranking of Keenum.\n15. Tony Banks (2001)\nGames: 15 | Record: 8-6 | TDs: 10 | INTs: 10 | Pass yards: 2,386\nHe became the surprise starter when Jeff George was waived after two games in 2001. Banks helped turn an 0-5 start into an 8-8 finish under coach Marty Schottenheimer. He played three more seasons with the Houston Texans, starting three games.\nKeim's take: Like Allen, he was better than several players ranked above him here, which is why I would have ranked him ninth.\n14. Jeff George (2000-01)\nGames: 8 | Record: 1-6 | TDs: 7 | INTs: 9 | Pass yards: 1,557\nWashington signed George despite a stellar 1999 season by Brad Johnson. George's name had come up the previous offseason, but one source said it was a unanimous \"no.\" The only change in 2000 was the new owner, Dan Snyder; George was signed. In 2000, coach Norv Turner resisted pressure to play George until Johnson was hurt.\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him about No. 20 because he just wasn't good with Washington.\n13. Rex Grossman (2010-12)\nGames: 17 | Record: 6-10 | TDs: 23 | INTs: 24 | Pass yards: 4,035\nAfter being benched in 2011, Grossman tried to limit risky throws. But he said he told himself, in essence, this is just who I am, so the \"gutsy\" throws returned.\n\"I really enjoyed Rex, but he could keep both teams in the game,\" Mike Shanahan said. \"He could win a game; he also could lose a game.\"\nKeim's take: Anywhere from No. 10 to No. 13 is good for Grossman.\n12. Mark Brunell (2004-06)*\nGames: 37 | Record: 16-19 | TDs: 38 | INTs: 20 | Pass yards: 6,033\nWashington traded a third-round pick for the 33-year-old Brunell in coach Joe Gibbs' first season back. Brunell wasn't flashy, but in 2005 he helped lead the team to a playoff berth -- and its last postseason win. A highlight: two touchdown passes in the final four minutes to Moss in a 14-13 Monday night win in Dallas.\n\"I liked Mark Brunell,\" Moss said. \"He had that veteran sense; he knew how to win.\"\nKeim's take: No. I would have ranked him at least No. 6, and I could be persuaded into putting him one or two spots higher. Strong leader, overcame an inefficient scheme.\n11. John Friesz (1994)\nGames: 16 | Record: 1-3 | TDs: 10 | INTs: 9 | Pass yards: 1,266\nHe served as the bridge QB to Shuler and Frerotte. It took four games to cross that bridge, and Friesz never started again in Washington, though he did play six more NFL seasons.\nKeim's take: No. 11 is a little high for Friesz, but only by perhaps three spots. He liked to push it down the field and averaged 7.0 yards per pass attempt.\n10. Trent Green (1995-98)\nGames: 16 | Record: 6-8 | TDs: 23 | INTs: 11 | Pass yards: 3,441\nGreen, cut in the CFL in 1994, finally got his chance in 1998 and won six of his last nine starts. But he was a free agent and, because Washington's franchise was for sale, the trustees would not let the team give signing bonuses.\nNFL PrimeTime on ESPN+\nChris Berman and Booger McFarland recap the weekend's games with extended highlights and analysis.\nThe show will stream live at 7:30 p.m. ET each Sunday during the season and will be available on demand each week until late Wednesday night. Watch on ESPN+\nFinally, on the eve of free agency, Washington received permission to make an offer. Too late; Green had already agreed to a deal with St. Louis.\n\"Trent was better than any f---ing quarterback we had here,\" said Mitchell, who played with Washington from 1990 to 1999. \"He might have been the best quarterback we've had in this franchise as far as overall ability since Mark Rypien.\"\nKeim's take: I would have moved him five spots higher and would be OK with him anywhere in the top eight, but he shouldn't be behind the five quarterbacks immediately ahead of him on this list. Never.\n9. Todd Collins (2006-09)*\nGames: 9 | Record: 3-1 | TDs: 5 | INTs: 0 | Pass yards: 1,032\nAfter safety Sean Taylor died in 2007, Washington won its last four games -- including all of Collins' starts in place of the injured Jason Campbell. Collins had not started a game in 10 years, throwing 27 passes during that span, but was well-versed in coordinator Al Saunders' system after spending five years with him in Kansas City.\nKeim's take: I would have pushed him a few spots lower, but you can't understate the impact he had during that late stretch run.\n8. Patrick Ramsey (2002-05)\nGames: 33 | Record: 10-14 | TDs: 34 | INTs: 29 | Pass yards: 5,649\nWashington traded back twice in the first round and drafted Ramsey with the No. 32 pick in 2002 despite Spurrier saying he had never met with him. At the time, one source said the coaching staff and front office did not tell Snyder the QB they were targeting, fearing he would leak it to the media.\nIn his first two starts, blitzed often, Ramsey was sacked 13 times and hit countless others as the offense rarely used max protection.\n\"Those quarterbacks were done a disservice,\" Jansen said.\nKeim's take: He should not be in the top 10, but somewhere around No. 12 makes sense.\nKiper's take on Ramsey (2002 first-round draft pick, No. 32 overall): His biggest issue was he didn't have mobility. He was like a 4.99, 5.0-flat guy [in the 40-yard dash]. He was a decent athlete, but that puts a lot of pressure on the [offensive] line. ... Tough, smart kid, and in the right system, I thought he could flourish.\"\n7. Colt McCoy (2014-19)\nGames: 12 | Record: 1-6 | TDs: 8 | INTs: 7 | Pass yards: 1,679\nInjuries always derailed McCoy's opportunities. He had the job at the end of 2014 before injuring his neck. He got another chance after Smith's injury in 2018 but broke his right leg in his second start, leading to multiple issues and still impacting him in 2019, when he started just one game.\nKeim's take: McCoy is a smart player but was hurt too often and didn't win when he played, so No. 7 is way too high. He belongs somewhere in the middle at best, and others would argue lower.\n6. Donovan McNabb (2010)\nGames: 13 | Record: 5-8 | TDs: 14 | INTs: 15 | Pass yards: 3,377\nThe coaches wanted Marc Bulger but ended up with McNabb after an Easter Sunday trade in 2010. It did not work out. McNabb was removed late in one game -- for conditioning -- and was benched for the final three games. McNabb's agent, Fletcher Smith, and offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan engaged in a public spat. Perhaps the low point: On Nov. 15, Washington gave McNabb a mostly hollow five-year extension worth nearly $80 million. There was a news conference before a Monday night game against his old team, the Eagles. That night, Eagles QB Michael Vick threw four touchdown passes and rushed for two more in a 59-28 win.\nKeim's take: I would have ranked him No. 11, but I get it: McNabb averaged 7.2 yards per attempt, which was better than Brunell (6.3) and Smith (6.5) in Washington.\n5. Jason Campbell (2005-09)\nGames: 52 | Record: 20-32 | TDs: 55 | INTs: 38 | Pass yards: 10,860\nHe was drafted No. 25 in 2005, one pick after Aaron Rodgers, to throw deep balls on play-action passes under Gibbs. They liked Campbell more than Rodgers, but a year later Gibbs hired Saunders, who did not run the same system. In Washington, Campbell played for two head coaches and three offensive coordinators after having four offensive coordinators at Auburn.\nKeim's take: Too high; he's more in the No. 8-9 range. Others were more effective -- namely Brunell and Smith -- but few were hurt more than Campbell by the constant changing of coaches and coordinators.\nKiper's take on Campbell (2005 first-round draft pick, No. 25 overall): I had Campbell with the same grade as my [players ranked from No. 42 to No. 52]. Having Cadillac Williams and Ronnie Brown [at running back] aided his cause [at Auburn]. He [was] big, athletic. But my concern was he put it all together for just one season, with the vital improvement being seen in his touchdown-to-interception ratio (20 TDs, 7 INTs in his final college season). That's why to me he was viewed as a borderline first- to third-round choice. That's why my thing was, go up and get Rodgers. He was my seventh-best player. [But] Rodgers in Washington might have been a bust. He sat three full years behind Brett Favre [in Green Bay], and they reconstructed his delivery.\n4. Gus Frerotte (1994-98)\nGames: 52 | Record: 19-26-1 | TDs: 48 | INTs: 44 | Pass yards: 9,769\nWashington had a middle-rounds grade on Frerotte, so it gladly drafted him in the seventh round in 1994 -- after taking Shuler in the first. Frerotte made the Pro Bowl in 1996, albeit with 12 TD passes and 11 interceptions, and played 15 NFL seasons. He's best remembered for head-butting the wall at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium after scoring in a 1997 game against the Giants that finished 7-7.\n\"I never get upset about it. Obviously if I could redo it I would, but I did it,\" Frerotte said of the head-butt. \"Like I tell my kids, I'll be on ESPN forever.\"\nKeim's take: I would have slotted him seventh, but spots No. 4 to No. 7 were difficult to rank because each offered something of value. Others on the list had more impact on winning games.\n3. Robert Griffin III (2012-15)*\nGames: 38 | Record: 14-22 | TDs: 40 | INTs: 23 | Pass yards: 8,097\nThe rookie season for the No. 2 pick in 2012 was magical: 20 touchdown passes, 3,200 passing yards, 815 rushing yards and only five interceptions. With Griffin, the zone-read became a popular play. He said he was happy to run the ball and dismissed the idea that he wanted to be only a drop-back passer after injuring his knee late in his rookie season, but Mike Shanahan says now, \"If Robert would have embraced the type of quarterback he was, I thought he could do so many things other quarterbacks couldn't do.\"\nSaid Griffin: \"Some defensive coordinators said that college stuff won't work, but we made it work -- and not just a little bit; we made it a staple of what we did. That showed coaches around the league you can do this with athletic quarterbacks.\"\nKeim's take: It is hard to top the impact of his rookie season, which is why I would have slotted him in this same spot. Based on his next three years, he would be far lower on the list.\nKiper's take on Griffin (2012 first-round draft pick, No. 2 overall): Some people liked RG III better than [No. 1 overall pick in 2012] Andrew Luck. [Longtime NFL coach] Tony Dungy went on record as liking RG III better. I gave Luck a 9.8 grade; I gave RG III a 9.4 grade. Nobody could argue with [Washington] taking RG III in that draft. Early on, he looked like he was going to be phenomenal. ... That injury was a big thing. As a rookie he looked like he was going to be better than Luck.\n2. Brad Johnson (1999-2000)*\nGames: 30 | Record: 18-11 | TDs: 35 | INTs: 28 | Pass yards: 6,510\nAfter Washington couldn't re-sign Green, it traded for Johnson, who threw for 4,005 yards and 24 touchdowns and was the NFL's fifth-ranked passer on the NFL's second-ranked offense in 1999. Washington won the NFC East, but Snyder signed George in the offseason.\nThat was the beginning of the end for Johnson, who knew, after multiple meetings with Snyder, that his days were numbered. Schottenheimer asked him to stay because Johnson was a good fit, but the damage was done. Johnson went to the Buccaneers, leading them to victory in Super Bowl XXXVII after the 2002 season.\n\"[Washington] was one place I would have wanted to stay,\" said Johnson, who played for four teams, including two stints with the Minnesota Vikings. \"I always told my wife and my close friends that I wish it would have worked out in Washington.\"\nSaid Mitchell: \"I would say Dan [Snyder] regrets that move, letting Brad leave, more than anything in the world. Brad was a real quarterback. He wasn't sexy, but he was intellectual.\"\nKeim's take: He would be tops on my list. The biggest issue was that he played only two years and was hurt for one of them.\n1. Kirk Cousins (2012-17)*\nGames: 64 | Record: 26-31-1 | TDs: 99 | INTs: 55 | Pass yards: 16,206\nCoaches always liked Cousins' ability and knowledge, and in 2015 it became obvious he should start. That season he threw for 4,166 yards, 29 touchdowns and 11 interceptions.\n\"[Before] if something bad happened he'd hang his head, but once he started having confidence, that's when he flourished,\" Gruden said.\nBut to keep Cousins, Washington needed to use the franchise tag in consecutive years. Once the team applied the first one, Cousins' side knew he would never sign a long-term deal because his price would be too high. The sides never came close to a deal.\nKeim's take: I understand why the analytics put him this high, but I would rank him second. If you had to win one game and were choosing between Cousins and Brad Johnson, I would take the latter."

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.
