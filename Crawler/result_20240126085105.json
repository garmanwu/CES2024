They enhance efficiency by allowing developers to reuse standardized pieces of API logic. Updates become seamless, as changes to shared components automatically reflect across multiple endpoints.\nAPI fragments promote consistency, ensuring a unified structure and behavior across different API endpoints. Collaboration is facilitated as teams can easily share and integrate these standardized components.\nSimplifying versioning, API fragments enable granular control, minimizing the risk of breaking changes.\n#mulesoft\n#APIFragments #IntegrationDevelopment \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u20ac\nhttps://lnkd.in/gmCP85n3\nDwinsoft Technologies:Leading Mulesoft Service Provider in India&US\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n5,668 followers\nExplore topics\nSign in to view more content\nCreate your free account or sign in to continue your search\nWelcome back\nor\nBy clicking Continue, you agree to LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.\nNew to LinkedIn?

        "raw_content": "CES 2024 Live Updates: Everything we saw from Samsung, Sony, Asus, and more\nConsumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 Live Updates: Everything that Samsung, Sony, AMD, Nvidia, and Asus\nare announcing at CES 2024, including new TVs, laptops, AI tech and more\nCES 2024 Las Vegas, Live Updates:\u00a0 It\u2019s that time of the year again when the world\u2019s biggest tech companies descend on Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show (CES). From January 9 to 12, thousands of big and small companies will showcase shiny new gadgets, including TVs, laptops, experimental tech, as well as electric vehicles. This year, the biggest theme to watch out for is generative artificial intelligence, and brands will most likely add AI to the devices we use every day. However, there are definitely many more things beyond AI that we hope to see at CES. For example, mixed reality/augmented reality headsets and glasses could take center stage, given that the Apple Vision Pro\u2019s retail availability is just around the corner. Other things expected to be on display are health tech devices.\nIndianexpress.com will update you on the latest from CES 2024.

When unfolded, the ZenScreen Fold transforms into a 17.3-inch screen, which weighs 1.16 KG and offers a native resolution of 2,560x1,920 with a 4:3 aspect ratio.\nThis is a pretty colour-accurate display with 100 per cent DCI-P3 colour gamut support and it is also DisplayHDR True Black 500 certified and can offer up to 500 nits of peak brightness in HDR mode. As of now, there is no information on pricing, and the company has confirmed that the monitor will be available for purchase in select markets in the second half of 2024.\n\u00f0\u0178\u2013\u00a5\u00ef\u00b8\u008fMeet the #ASUS #ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH\u2014the world's 1st foldable OLED portable display!\u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u00a9\u00e2\u02dc\u2018\u00ef\u00b8\u008fCompact with 17.3'' QHD foldable technology\u00e2\u02dc\u2018\u00ef\u00b8\u008fVibrant OLED colors & contrast\u00e2\u02dc\u2018\u00ef\u00b8\u008fDurable for lab-tested connectivity ports\u00e2\u017e\u00a1\u00ef\u00b8\u008fExplore: https://t.co/ekVSrhx6O0#ASUSLaunchEvent #CES2024 pic.twitter.com/RxSVlRcEZy\nTCL NXTPAPER 3.0 display\nTCL showcased a new smartphone display technology called NXTPAPER display (full-colour electronic paper display), which feels more like a paper rather than a digital screen. The 3rd iteration of the NXTPAPER display called NXTPAPER 3.0 solves several issues found in the previous version of this technology, which now offers more accurate colour reproduction and higher colour accuracy, just like an LCD or an OLED screen.\nIt is also easy on the eyes, as it blocks out blue light. On top of that, it also offers a higher resolution of up to 2K, and the company even announced the TCL Tab 10 with NXTPAPER 3.0 display technology.\n\u00f0\u0178\u201d\u00ae Prepare for visual perfection with TCL NXTPAPER 3.0! \u00f0\u0178\u0152\u02c6 Natural light, adaptive color temperature, and magic with NXTPAPER Key.#TechEvolution #TCLNXTPAPER #INSPIREGREATNESS #CES #CES2024 #DisplayGreatness #OptimizedForYou pic.twitter.com/w7m8L3m6OF\nLenovo\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s eco-friendly mouse and keyboard concept powered by human and solar energy\nIf you are looking for some eco-friendly PC accessories, you might want to check out Lenovo's latest concept products. The company has unveiled a mouse and keyboard combo that can be powered by human and solar energy. The mouse has a hand crank that can be rotated for a few minutes to give it enough juice for half an hour of wireless use.\nThe keyboard has a similar feature, with a dial that can be spun to charge it up. It also has solar panels on top that can harvest sunlight to keep it running. These products are designed to reduce the need for batteries and electricity, and to appeal to the environmentally conscious consumers. Lenovo says these are just prototypes for now, but they could be a glimpse into the future of PC peripherals.\nAsus joins the mixed-reality trend\nAsus is taking on Apple's Vision Pro (with M2) with its own wearable display, the AirVision M1. The glasses, unveiled at CES 2024, let you watch content from your phone or computer on a 1080p Micro OLED screen that appears in front of your eyes. The AirVision M1 also features built-in speakers, a touchpad for adjusting the display, and the ability to pin the virtual screen in a fixed location. Unlike Apple's Vision Pro, which is a wireless VR headset, the AirVision M1 uses a wired connection over DisplayPort. Asus has not announced the price or availability of the AirVision M1 yet, but we expect it to be in the same range as TCL's $399 glasses. The AirVision M1 is an interesting alternative to Apple's Vision Pro, but it remains to be seen how comfortable and practical they are to wear.\nTata Technologies at CES 2024\nTata Technologies at CES 2024 showcased several innovative solutions. As a strategic engineering and system integration partner to automotive OEMs and Tier 1 suppliers, Tata Technologies will help OEMs to launch competitively priced vehicles and the company will also provide solutions to secure vehicles from cyber threads for a safer connected experience.\nThe solutions provided by Tata Technologies include full vehicle software integration. The company will also be showcasing some of these innovations on the ground at CES 2024 in Las Vegas.\n#CES2024 is where #Innovation meets the future.

Featuring the company's 'e-corner system' motion technology, the car can make both lateral and diagonal motions and even take stationary pivot turns. Hyundai Mobis said it developed the new technology by integrating suspensions, steering and braking with the in-wheel and has also conducted on-road tests of the system's capabilities.\nLee Seung-Hwan, Vice President and the Head of Advanced Engineering at Hyundai Mobis said that the technologies used in the car are available for immediate mass production. The company also revealed the car's autonomous driving sensor and lamp technologies, which include three light detection and ranging (LiDAR) devices\nRabbit R1 generative-AI-powered gadget\nRabit R1, a smart Humane AI Pin-like gadget, powered by Rabbit OS is a smart connected device with generative AI capabilities. Priced at $199, the device comes with a camera, a small 2.88-inch screen, and physical navigation buttons to control the device and it does not require any subscription, and there is also a regular USB-C port for charging.\nRabbit R1 can be used to make calls, and send SMS, and it also doubles as an AI-powered personal assistant. The company also claims that it can answer most queries within 500 milliseconds.
