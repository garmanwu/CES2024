Here\u2019s how it works.\nStarship, Starlink and more: SpaceX poised for huge 2024\nThe company wants to launch nearly 150 missions this year.\nSurprise, surprise: SpaceX plans to set more spaceflight records this year.\nElon Musk's company launched 96 orbital missions in 2023, a big jump from its previous high of 61, which was set a year earlier. And SpaceX is planning another big leap in 2024, one that will take it well above the century mark.\n\"As we look to next year, we want to increase [our] flight rate to about 12 flights per month, or 144 flights,\" Bill Gerstenmaier, SpaceX's vice president of build and flight reliability, said on Oct. 18 during a hearing of the U.S. Senate's Subcommittee on Space and Science.\nThat works out to one launch every 2.8 days, a cadence that would have been unthinkable just a few years ago. But SpaceX has a history of reframing our ideas of what is possible in spaceflight, so that ambitious target seems eminently achievable.\nRelated:\u00a08 ways that SpaceX has transformed spaceflight\nStarlink will lead the way\nRoughly two-thirds of SpaceX's launches in 2023 were devoted to building out Starlink, the company's satellite-internet megaconstellation. That trend will likely continue in 2024, for the network is nowhere near complete.\nStarlink currently consists of about 5,230 operational spacecraft, according to astrophysicist and satellite tracker Jonathan McDowell. But SpaceX has permission to deploy a total of 12,000 Starlink satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO), and the company has applied for approval for another 30,000 on top of that.\nSo Starlink batches should keep flying from both coasts \u2014 Vandenberg Space Force Base in California and Florida's Cape Canaveral Space Force Station and Kennedy Space Center \u2014 throughout 2024.\nWe'll also see some more SpaceX astronaut launches this year.\nThe company launched three crewed missions to the International Space Station (ISS) in 2023 \u2014 two for NASA and one for Axiom Space, a Houston-based company that aims to get its own outpost up and running in LEO a few years from now.\nSpaceX will send five astronaut missions skyward this year, if all goes according to plan. The Crew-8 and Crew-9 flights for NASA are scheduled to lift off in February and August, respectively. Axiom's Ax-3 mission will launch on Jan. 17, and Ax-4 is targeted for no earlier than October. And, in April, SpaceX plans to launch Polaris Dawn, a free-flying mission to LEO that will feature the first-ever spacewalk by a private astronaut.\nRelated: SpaceX's Ax-2 mission for Axiom Space in photos (gallery)\nStarship getting ready to go\nNinety-one of SpaceX's 96 orbital missions last year were flown by its workhorse Falcon 9 rocket, and the company's powerful Falcon Heavy accounted for the other five.\nBut 2023 also featured two test flights of the launcher that SpaceX thinks will spur a revolution in spaceflight and exploration \u2014 Starship, the biggest and most powerful rocket ever built.\nThe Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy both feature reusable first stages, a serious breakthrough in spaceflight tech. But Starship, which stands about 400 feet (122 meters) tall when fully stacked, is designed to be fully reusable. Indeed, Musk wants Starship's huge Super Heavy booster to land directly on its launch mount after liftoffs, to enable rapid inspection, refurbishment and reflight.\nStarship's two test flights lifted off from SpaceX's Starbase facility in South Texas, in April and November of last year, respectively. Both missions aimed to send the vehicle's upper stage most of the way around Earth, with splashdown targeted for a patch of the Pacific near Hawaii.\nThe April flight didn't last long. Starship suffered several serious problems, including the failure of its two stages to separate, and SpaceX intentionally destroyed the tumbling vehicle just four minutes after liftoff.\nStarship made progress on its second flight; Super Heavy's 33 Raptor engines all fired as planned, and the booster separated successfully from the upper stage. But this mission too ended early, with the destruction of the upper stage about eight minutes into flight.\nWe shouldn't have to wait long for flight number three. Just last week, SpaceX test-fired the engines of its latest Starship prototype, which it plans to launch pretty much as soon as it gets a license from the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration. (The FAA is currently overseeing an investigation into what happened on the November Starship flight.)\nSpaceX is also working to get other Starship vehicles ready, in keeping with the company's development philosophy, which prioritizes frequent test flights and rapid iteration.\n\"I think maybe by the end of the year, they actually get it down pat in a functional way. Not on cadence, but just demonstrating the reusability,\" Justus Parmar, CEO of the venture capital and advisory firm Fortuna Investments, which focuses heavily on the space industry, said of SpaceX's Starship efforts. \"So, that's going to be huge.\"\nTime is of the essence for Starship's development. NASA chose the giant vehicle to be the first crewed lander for its Artemis program, which aims to establish a permanent, sustainable human presence on and around the moon by the end of the 2020s. The plan calls for Starship to ferry astronauts to the lunar surface for the first time on the Artemis 3 mission, which is currently scheduled to lift off in late 2025 or 2026.\nRelated: NASA's Artemis program: Everything you need to know\n\u2014 \u200aSee stunning photos and video of Starship's 2nd launch\n\u2014 SpaceX: Facts about Elon Musk's private spaceflight company\n\u2014\u00a0SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket launches NASA's Psyche probe to bizarre metal asteroid (video)\nPrivate spaceflight ramping up\nThe last two years have been rough for investors in most fields, and space was no exception.\n\"Growth has been crushed,\" Parmar told Space.com. \"Everything's down like 70 to 90%.\"\nBut he sees a turnaround coming. Money will start flowing into the space ecosystem in a serious way again this year, potentially leading to a \"banner year\" in 2025, Parmar predicts.\n\"The technology is the furthest it's ever been, and yet we've got valuations that are somewhat the lowest they've ever been in a certain capacity. So I think that setup with new capital is really promising,\" he said.\nLow prices and rapidly advancing technology aren't the only factors that are poised to move the needle. The continued success of SpaceX, which dominates the private spaceflight industry, is showing investors that there is money to be made in the final frontier. And that's critical, according to Parmar.\n\"In every burgeoning or emerging industry, you always need a frontrunner \u2014 you need a success story,\" he said. \"If there are no winners in the industry, nobody's ever going to support [it].\"\nGoogle was such a frontrunner in the early 2000s, when investors needed a success story after the internet bubble burst, Parmar noted. Google ended up reshaping the entire internet economy, and SpaceX may do something similar in the final frontier.\nThat's not to suggest that SpaceX will be the only spaceflight company to have a big 2024. Parmar thinks Blue Origin, which Amazon's Jeff Bezos founded back in 2000, is poised for a breakout year.\nBlue Origin just got a new CEO \u2014 Dave Limp, who had been Amazon's senior vice president of devices and services. In addition, Bezos recently announced that he's moving from Seattle to Miami. He broke the news in an Instragram post, which also noted that \"Blue Origin's operations are increasingly shifting to Cape Canaveral.\" The Space Coast lies\u00a0just a few hundred miles from Bezos' new home in South Florida\nThese signs point to Bezos prioritizing Blue Origin more than he has in the past, and being more actively involved in the company's activities, Parmar said. (Like SpaceX, Blue Origin has bold ambitions; Bezos has said he wants to help humanity extend its footprint out into the solar system.)\n\"I think everything that they've been doing is just going to get sped up,\" Parmar said. \"He's going all in on this.\"\nJoin our Space Forums to keep talking space on the latest missions, night sky and more!

        "raw_content": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\nEverything you need to know about SpaceX's Starlink and 'space internet'\nCheap, fast internet access from orbit\nElon Musk\u2019s SpaceX is making a huge commitment to the internet. Not in the form of another one of its \u201cwhoop whoop yeah!\u201d style webcasts (though it will do that, too), but by steadily launching up to 12,000 of SpaceX\u2019s own satellites that could eventually bring fast Internet access to every human irrespective of where they are on the planet.\nThis is Starlink, and it\u2019s happening.\nAt the time of writing, Starlink makes up a quarter of all active satellites, and that share is only increasing each month. The service has deployed over 1,000 satellites in order to provide internet access to its current subscribers and is continuing to expand so it can boost both coverage and performance.\nWhat is Starlink?\nStarlink is a plan by SpaceX to put 12,000 satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO) that offer high-speed, low-latency, cheap internet access to anyone anywhere on the planet. That\u2019s the end-game. All you would need to use Starlink is a $200 pizza box-sized receiver. Each satellite will talk to four others using lasers as they constantly orbit Earth, together creating a web of Ku-band and Ka-band broadband connectivity as fast as the speed of light that surrounds the planet at all times, and for all locations.\nIn order to beam connectivity to the surface, a massive network of ground-based stations will also be necessary. So although 12,000 satellites sounds like a lot, it's only a fraction of the infrastructure that SpaceX will have to construct.\nStarlink will happen in phases, but the ultimate goal is to have about 8,000 satellites orbiting just 500km above the planet, and the remaining 4,000 orbiting much higher up, at around 1,200km.\nHow many people are currently using Starlink?\nAccording to a recent FCC filing, over 10,000 people have enrolled in the public beta test which launched last year. This number accounts for users across the US, Canada, and the UK.\nThe filing\u2019s objective is to have Starlink designated as an eligible telecommunications carrier. This would allow SpaceX to access millions in funding from the Rural Digital Opportunity and increase the reach of its coverage.\nHow good is Starlink\u2019s internet?\nIn the same FCC filing where we are told about the number of users, we also learned some stats for the service. For a service that\u2019s still only in beta, they aren\u2019t half-bad.\nThese will obviously be more favorable views of the company\u2019s current capabilities, and a fair distance away from the 10 Gbps Starlink hopes to achieve, but they show that \u2018space internet\u2019 is definitely a viable option in the industry, and that\u2019s only at one-twelfth of the planned satellites!\nWhat is 'space internet'?\nSpace internet is simply satellite-powered Internet access. This is not a new thing. Telecommunications satellites mostly sit in a geostationary orbit thousands of miles above Earth's equator and follow the direction of Earth's rotation, so appearing to stay in one place to serve one region. Their distance from Earth means a lag of about a second or more.\nHowever, actual internet access via existing satellites is severely limited; Iridium\u2019s LEO network offers data speeds of 2.4 kbps, and though that\u2019s soon going to jump to 512 kbps (thanks to several dedicated rocket launches by SpaceX, ironically), it\u2019s expensive and designed to serve companies and governments that need critical links in remote areas of the world (think container ships and scientists in the Antarctic), not the mass market.\nStarlink satellites will be 65 times closer to Earth than geostationary satellites, and could also offer speeds of 10Gbps, which is faster than fiber optic internet.\nWhy is SpaceX getting into \u2018space internet\u2019?\nIf SpaceX can offer speeds of 10 Gbps to every human on the planet, and undercut land-based networks, it could become a massive internet service provider. Add to that the fact that 50% of humans still have no internet access, and you start to see why SpaceX is so interested in making the most of its own rocket launch capabilities.\nThough constructing Starlink could cost over US$10 billion, there\u2019s evidence that SpaceX expects Starlink could earn it US$30 billion each year by 2025. Starlink\u2019s success could therefore be pivotal for Elon Musk\u2019s plans to go to Mars.\nIs Starlink the only \u2018space internet\u2019 provider?\nFar from it. The world of satellite broadband is hotting-up, and high-speed \u2018space internet\u2019 is increasingly looking like the future. Expensive, regionally-locked yet fast satellite broadband services are incoming, while OneWeb \u2013 supported by Intelsat, Virgin Qualcomm, SoftBank and Hughes Networks Systems \u2013 intends to launch 640 satellites across 21 launches to create global broadband by 2020.\nIt launched its first 12 satellites in February. There\u2019s also Amazon, whose \u2018Project Kuiper\u2019 could see 3,236 satellites create a global broadband internet service after 2021.\nSpaceX Starlink is hugely ambitious, but it won\u2019t be alone.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nJamie is a freelance tech, travel and space journalist based in the UK.

He also revealed that the company has an even more ambitious goal for 2024: To launch around 12 flights a month, for a total of 144 missions for the whole year. According to a company official who talked to Ars Technica, SpaceX intends to ramp up its mission numbers next year, mostly so that it could officially roll out its satellite-to-cell phone service.\n\"With our 2 million users, (we) need that constellation refreshed,\" the spokesperson told Ars. \"We're also going to look at direct to cell communications with Starlink, and that's a key feature that gets added next year with those 144 flights.\"\nThe company first announced the service, which will allow normal smartphones to connect with its satellites, back in 2022. It made the revelation alongside T-Mobile, which promised to make the capability accessible to its subscribers. T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert likened the technology to putting a cellular tower in the sky and said it could eliminate deadzones one day, allowing people to easily get in touch with loved ones even if they're in the middle of the ocean. SpaceX VP of Starlink enterprise sales Jonathan Hofeller also said earlier this year that the company is gearing up to start testing the service.\nAs Ars notes, SpaceX previously said that the capability will require larger satellites that will launch onboard the company's Starship vehicle. The giant rocket is yet to be operational, though, and the company had to design an intermediate-sized Starlink satellite that can fly on its Falcon 9 rockets. That satellite is bigger than older models but smaller than the ones needed to enable voice and data services. SpaceX doesn't have plans to roll out Starlink voice and data until 2025, though, and will introduce its direct-to-cell capability with texting coverage only next year."

SpaceX obtained approval from U.S. regulators last month to test the satellites in partnership with T-Mobile. SpaceX has a number of other partnerships with native telecom companies in countries including Australia, Canada and Japan.\nThe approval, which was granted by the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, was for a 180-day period. SpaceX said the tests would eventually involve 840 satellites transmitting 4G connectivity to around 2,000 unmodified smartphones. The satellites will act as \u201ccell phone towers in space,\u201d according to Starlink\u2019s website.\nThe website estimates that texting will become available this year, with voice and data services starting in 2025 and connection for Internet of Things devices also in 2025, though SpaceX will need to get regulatory approval before commencing commercial service.\nWhile SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said that the service \u201cwill allow for mobile phone connectivity anywhere on Earth,\u201d he added some realistic caveats: \u201cWhile this is a great solution for locations with no cellular connectivity, it is not meaningfully competitive with existing terrestrial cellular networks.\u201d\nThis will allow for mobile phone connectivity anywhere on Earth.\nNote, this only supports ~7Mb per beam and the beams are very big, so while this is a great solution for locations with no cellular connectivity, it is not meaningfully competitive with existing terrestrial\u2026 https://t.co/ymHpw8XBHl\n\u2014 Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 3, 2024\nBut even with these limitations, there is undoubtably a race among companies looking to take a share of the direct-to-cell market.

The enhanced Starlink satellites have an advanced modem that acts as a cellphone tower in space, eliminating dead zones with network integration similar to a standard roaming partner,\" the company said.\nBesides T-Mobile in the US, several carriers in other countries have signed up to use the direct-to-cell satellites. SpaceX said the other carriers are Rogers in Canada, KDDI in Japan, Optus in Australia, One NZ in New Zealand, Salt in Switzerland, and Entel in Chile and Peru.\nWhile SpaceX CEO Elon Musk wrote that the satellites will \"allow for mobile phone connectivity anywhere on Earth,\" he also described a significant bandwidth limit. \"Note, this only supports ~7Mb per beam and the beams are very big, so while this is a great solution for locations with no cellular connectivity, it is not meaningfully competitive with existing terrestrial cellular networks,\" Musk wrote.\nStarlink's direct-to-cell website says the service will provide text messaging only when it becomes available in 2024, with voice and data service beginning sometime in 2025. Starlink's low Earth orbit satellites will work with standard LTE phones, unlike earlier services that required phones specifically built for satellite use. SpaceX's direct-to-cell satellites will also connect with Internet of Things (IoT) devices in 2025, the company says.\nT-Mobile plans field testing \u201csoon\u201d\nT-Mobile said that field testing of Starlink satellites with the T-Mobile network will begin soon. \"With well over half a million square miles of the US and vast stretches of ocean unreachable by terrestrial network coverage, due to terrain limitations, land-use restrictions and more, this new service aims to give customers a crucial additional layer of connectivity when and where they need it most,\" T-Mobile said.\nT-Mobile noted that yesterday's SpaceX launch was \"the first of many\" to include Starlink satellites with cellular capabilities, but was vague on when exactly the different components of direct-to-cell service will become available to customers. \"Initially, the service will begin with text messaging, with voice and data coverage to follow in the coming years,\" T-Mobile said.\nThe SpaceX/T-Mobile partnership was announced in August 2022. At that time, Musk said it could provide beta service before the end of 2023. The companies said in March 2023 that they were still planning to test the service before the end of the year, but it later became clear that it wouldn't happen until 2024.\nChannel Ars Technica\nRelated Stories\nToday on Ars\nNewsletter Signup\nJoin the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

The new page for \"Starlink Direct to Cell\" promises \"ubiquitous coverage\" from \"cellphone towers in space\" that will work over bog-standard LTE. The current timeline claims there will be text service starting in 2024, voice and data in 2025, and \"IoT\" service in 2025.\nToday satellite phone connectivity still requires giant, purpose-built hardware, like the old-school Iridium network phones. If you're only looking for emergency texting, you can also make do with Apple's introduction of the barely there connectivity paradigm, requiring being inside a connectivity window, holding up a phone, and following a signal-targeting app. Starlink wants to bring full-blown space connectivity to normal smartphone hardware.\nFurther Reading\nOnce the space network gets up and running, SpaceX says the service \"works with existing LTE phones wherever you can see the sky. No changes to hardware, firmware, or special apps are required, providing seamless access to text, voice, and data.\" There will be hardware changes to Starlink satellites, though, with the latest versions sporting the necessary LTE equipment. The new site doesn't reiterate expectations for service speed, but when this project was announced in 2022, the claim was 2\u20134Mbps.\nThe page says Starlink satellites with the Direct to Cell capability will first be launched on the workhorse Falcon 9 rocket and eventually Starship. Starship's bigger payload represents a big capability upgrade for Starlink since the full-size \"V2\" satellites don't fit on the smaller Falcon 9, and today the company is getting by with \"V2 Mini\" variants due to Starship delays. The 2025 and 2026 service upgrades for Direct to Cell most likely depend on getting the big rocket up and running, so like all SpaceX projects, you should take these timelines with a grain of salt. This whole project was originally scheduled to start a \"beta service\" this year, but making that deadline now looks iffy.\nWhen the new network eventually gets up and running, SpaceX has several traditional cell phone companies lined up to sell the service. The page lists SpaceX's partners as T-Mobile in the US, Rogers in Canada, KDDI in Japan, Optus in Australia, One NZ in New Zealand, and Salt in Switzerland. The new promo page is seeking additional cellular partners.\nChannel Ars Technica\nRelated Stories\nToday on Ars\nNewsletter Signup\nJoin the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

The launch, carrying 22 Starlink satellites, will add to the more than 5,300 satellites already in orbit.\nThe rocket lifted off from Space Launch Complex 4 East (SLC-4E) at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California on Sunday, Jan. 14, at 12:59 a.m. PST (3:59 a.m. EST, 0859 UTC). The launch has already been delayed multiple times, as delay from Thursday was also due to poor weather, according to SpaceX.\nThe first stage booster supporting this mission, tail number B1061, launched for the 18th time. It previously launched two astronaut flights, two Transporter ride-share missions and seven Starlink flights among seven other missions.\nFollowing liftoff, the booster landed on the droneship \u2018Of Course I Still Love You\u2019 about 8.5 minutes later.\nWhile four launches in two weeks would be an incredible pace for any other launch company, SpaceX\u2019s launch cadence has slowed down a bit at the start of the year since one of its East Coast droneships is still sidelined.\nThe droneship, \u2018Just Read the Instructions,\u2019 has not yet returned to service after B1058 fell over during the recovery process following the launch of the Starlink 6-36 mission in late December.\nA Falcon 9 is currently scheduled to make another Starlink delivery mission from Cape Canaveral later on Saturday at 7:52 p.m. EST (0052 UTC). The drone ship \u2018A Shortfall of Gravitas\u2019 left Port Canaveral Thursday evening to support that mission.\nWhile SpaceX did not say if Starlink 7-10 is carrying additional satellites that feature direct to cellphone capabilities, the company has been making strides on the testing front. In an update on Wednesday, SpaceX stated that they successfully sent and received text messages via Starlink using the T-Mobile network.\n\u201cAs the global leader in rocket and satellite launch and manufacturing, SpaceX is uniquely positioned to rapidly scale our Direct to Cell network and will rapidly launch a constellation of hundreds of satellites to enable text service in 2024 and voice, data, and Internet of Things (IoT) services in 2025,\u201d SpaceX said in a statement.\nSatellite connectivity direct to cell phones will have a tremendous impact around the world, helping people communicate wherever and whenever they want or need to. https://t.co/UewoRPpcTC\n\u2014 Gwynne Shotwell (@Gwynne_Shotwell) January 10, 2024\nThe company is also in the midst of preparing for the first of four planned crewed missions to the International Space Station in 2024.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStarlink internet coverage, cost, speeds and the latest news \u2014 what you need to know\nElon Musk\u2019s Starlink satellite internet service is seeing rapid speed gains and increased adoption\nElon Musk\u2019s satellite internet company Starlink is already approaching broadband speeds. Actually, Starlink Premium, a new higher-end tier, surpasses some of the best broad speeds available in the U.S., albeit, at an absurdly high price.\nWhile it\u2019s still fairly early on, Starlink is already having an impact on people living in rural parts of the world. In our Starlink review, we were thoroughly impressed by the new satellite internet service but there are still lots of questions and variables that need to be taken into account.\nSpaceX has also launched Starlink RV which is a service meant for users on-the-go or who live in campers. While you can skip the line and get Starlink's RV plan instantly, there is a downside though as network services are de-prioritized for Starlink RV compared to other Starlink products \u2013 which means a degraded service and slower speeds.\nSo far, SpaceX has launched more than 5,300 Starlink satellites with new launches scheduled quite frequently. These satellites will continue to help cover the continental U.S., Canada and the U.K. At the same time, NASA and SpaceX have come to an information-sharing agreement to help avoid orbital collisions.\nSpaceX also recently revealed its next-gen Starlink V2 Mni satellites which now use the E-band for backhaul. This will allow Starlink to provide four times more capacity per satellite compared to its previous iterations.\nYou can currently order Starlink, which promises to deliver broadband speeds of up to 300 Mbps to anyone in the world regardless of where they are. Whether it be a rural farm in Iowa or a remote village in Canada, customers are reporting greatly improved internet speeds with Starlink.\nAccording to a report from Ookla, median download speeds for Starlink dramatically increased between the first quarter of 2021 and 2022 in both the U.S. and Canada. The service\u2019s speeds saw a 38 percent increase in the U.S. and in Canada, speeds increased by nearly 58 percent in the same time period. In the U.S., Starlink users can expect to get speeds around 90.55 Mbps while Canadian users should see speeds close to 97.40 Mbps.\nSpaceX is continuing to launch more satellites and service is already reaching more parts of the continental U.S., Canada and parts of Europe. We now have an even better indication of how rollout is going, thanks to a new coverage map.\nBut what is Starlink? Below you'll find a rundown of this project that aims to get everyone in the world connected to high speed internet.\nLatest Starlink news (updated Nov 1)\nStarlink release date\nStarlink officially exited beta two years ago but it\u2019s currently only available in select regions and countries. However, the company plans to make its satellite internet service available worldwide soon.\nAs of right now, Starlink is available in the U.S., Canada, the UK, France, Germany, Austria, the Netherlands, Ireland, Belgium, Switzerland, Denmark, Portugal, Australia and New Zealand. According to Starlink\u2019s pre order agreement though, its satellite internet service will also launch in Italy, Poland, Spain and Chile but no release date has been set yet.\nBack in May of 2022, Starlink completed its first deployment in Asia by launching in the Philippines. After making preorders available in India in October, 2021, the company\u2019s Sanjay Bhargava revealed that the Indian government had halted pre orders until SpaceX received the regulatory approval in the country.\nWhile it\u2019s still difficult to get Starlink satellite internet coverage at the moment, a filing with the FCC in May of 2022 revealed that the service already has over 400,000 subscribers. If you live in an area that\u2019s currently unsupported, you can still order Starlink on the company\u2019s website to hold your place in line. Once the service expands to more areas this year, you\u2019ll receive a notification that your Starlink is ready to ship.\nEven if you have no plans to use Starlink as your home internet provider, you will soon be able to use the service\u2019s satellites with your smartphone. T-Mobile President and CEO Mike Sievert announced back in August that the mobile carrier would begin working together with SpaceX on a plan to provide its customers with text coverage everywhere in the continental U.S. Likewise, Elon Musk revealed in a post on Twitter that he had discussions with Apple about using Starlink\u2019s satellite service on the iPhone. This makes a lot of sense, especially now that the iPhone 14 includes a new Emergency SOS via Satellite feature.\nStarlink availability and coverage\nAlthough Starlink initially prioritized \u201chigh latitudes\u201d or areas in the northern part of the Earth like Canada and the upper parts of the United States, that seems to have changed. According to a few coverage maps available online, Starlink coverage now seems to be readily available in the lower hemisphere of the Earth as well. In a tweet from back in 2020, Musk explained that Starlink would arrive in cities like Seattle first and then \u201cget progressively closer to the equator\u201d.\nAccording to BroadbandNow, Starlink currently has more than 400,000 subscribers and Space X has launched a total of 2,700 LEO satellites into orbit. However, 750,000 pre orders have been submitted to Space X for Starlink satellite internet and the company is working to fulfill them all by the end of the year.\nIn the U.S., Starlink is currently available in 32 states including Alaska, California, Hawaii, New York, Texas and others which have a max download speed of 350 Mbps. In these states, big cities with Starlink coverage include New York City, Las Vegas, San Francisco, Portland, Philadelphia, Seattle and El Paso.\nStarlink price\nStarlink preorders currently cost $99 a month. But the service will require an up-front hardware fee of $499. That includes the small satellite dish that can be set up at a home or business, as well as a router and power supply. There's also a shipping and handling fee of $50.\nFor anyone wanting to preorder, all it requires is a refundable $99 deposit. Order fulfillment can take up to six months or more.\nStarlink's Standard service now costs $120 per month for 24-220 Mbps. Meanwhile, its Business plans are available in three different packages: Priority 40GB for $140 per month, Priority 1TB for $250 per month and Priority 2TB for $500 per month.\nIf you want to use Starlink on the go, then you're going to need one of the company's Land Mobility packages which offer 40-220 Mbps. Mobile Priority 50GB costs $250 per month, Mobile Priority 1TB costs $1,000 per month and Mobile Priority 5T costs $5,000 per month.\nSpaceX has also unveiled a new suite of \"Priority\" plans for customers who need the fastest internet possible. All of these plans also come with unlimited standard speed data. The 1TB Priority plan comes in at $250 per month, the 2 TB Priority plan costs $500 per month and the 6TB Priority plan costs $1,500 per month. Starlink recommends that users of these new Priority plans pair them with its High Performance dish.\nSpaceX has now rebranded Starlink RV as Starlink Roam. It's available in two different versions, one costs $150 per month and is intended to be used regionally while the other can be used for global roaming for $200 per month. Regadless of which option you choose, the dish itself still costs $599.\nTo get top speeds, it's a good idea to pair Starlink with one of the best Wi-Fi routers.\nStarlink Premium\nElon Musk is never shy when it comes to launching faster models at high prices, and Starlink Premium is no different. Starlink Premium is a $500 monthly internet tier that offers speeds of up to 500 Mbps. It will also require a new $2,500 antenna and a $500 deposit for those wanting orders as quickly as possible. This tier is designed for, \"small offices, storefronts, and super users across the globe,\" or what SpaceX calls \"high demand users.\"\nStarlink Premium customers in the mid-west and southern U.S. can expect their shipments to arrive this year. However, there is immediate availability in most other U.S. states.\nWhat Starlink users are saying\nThe response to Starlink's internet service has been overwhelmingly positive from the few customers receiving service. Head on over to the Starlink subreddit, and you'll find users posting images of their new satellites, with accompanying speed tests. In Missouri, users are reporting download speeds of 150 Mbps. Another user in Idaho uploaded 72 hours worth of test results, and found speeds to be an average of 71 Mbps.\nA user in the U.K. saw a massive leap in internet speed after installing Starlink. Aaron Wilkes from Kent, went from 1 Mbps to 175 Mbps. While Wilkes is paying more for Starlink, he feels the price is worth it.\n\"The ability to be able to download content so quickly compared to our standard BT line is amazing,\u201d said Wilkes in an interview with the PA news agency.\nMega popular YouTube channel Linus Tech Tips was also able to procure a Starlink satellite system. They were able to stream four 4K videos at once and successfully played through a game of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with little issue.\nAnd director Jesse Senko, who lives in a rural Ontario, Canada, detailed how Starlink massively upgraded his workflow in the video below.\nStarlink specs and IPO\nUnlike other satellite internet providers, Starlink's LEO satellites promise to offer low-latency broadband speeds regardless of where you are. While Starlink was first boasting speeds of 1 Gbps, it's since upped that target to 10 Gbps. To put that into context, users would be able to download a 4K movie in less than 30 seconds. Starlink would be a major boon for people living in rural parts of the world.\nSpeed test analysis by Ookla shows Starlink seeing major gains in speed in the past few months. Median download speed has jumped from 65.72 Mbps to 97 Mbps. Actually, Starlink is creeping up on average median broadband speeds of 115.22 Mbps. The second leg of the Starlink network should see even faster speeds,\nLatency on Starlink is surprisingly low considering its satellite internet. Early beta tests show that Starlink averages 34 milliseconds. While that may not be as fast as fiber, which can get as low as 17ms, any latency under 40ms is solid for most applications. Certain types of online games, most notably shooters and fighting games, benefit most from low latency. But sports games or MOBAs will work well on Starlink.\u00a0Musk has admitted as such, aiming to bring pings down below 20ms.\nIt goes without saying, Starlink absolutely destroys other satellite internet companies like HughesNet and Viasat. Both offer download speeds at a fifth of Starlink with latency that's ten times higher.\nBecause of this, it's no surprise that OneWeb (half-owned by the UK government), Amazon's Project Kuiper, Boeing, Telesat, and the Russian and Chinese governments are all planning satellite internet constellations.\nStill, getting a project of this magnitude literally off the ground and into profitability is a monumental task. While the Russian and Chinese governments can bear the brunt of the cost, companies like Starlink and Amazon take on significant risk. Past satellite internet constellations have gone bankrupt.\nThere's also a lot of interest in when a Starlink IPO would go live. In a tweet, Musk replied that an IPO is planned, but it would come after SpaceX has a more predictable cashflow. For Musk and Starlink, the goal right now is not to go bankrupt.\nStarlink in your Tesla?\nIt seems that SpaceX has made a request with the Federal Communications Commission to bring Starlink satellite internet service to jets and ships. In a letter to the FCC by SpaceX director of satellite policy, as acquired by CNBC, David Goldman states, \"This application would serve the public interest by authorizing a new class of ground-based components for SpaceX\u2019s satellite system that will expand the range of broadband capabilities available to moving vehicles throughout the United States and to moving vessels and aircraft worldwide.\"\nThe company would handle vehicle installation through \"qualified installers\" and cited the need for quality internet \"while on the move.\"\nSpaceX has also made a second filing with the FCC regarding a more rugged satellite dish, one that can handle moving conditions or more extreme climates. Already, Starlink satellites are shutting down in extreme heat, forcing users to water their \"Dishys\" like they would flowers.\nThere is the issue of internet access varying between countries. Some countries, like China, have a strictly controlled internet infrastructure. Sites that might be okay to view in the U.S. likely would not be in China. But this is satellite internet, meaning it can be accessed from anywhere. It seems that Starlink will default to the rules of the country you're in, \"whichever is more constraining.\"\nThis is all academic right now, though. Because of the size of the Starlink satellite terminal, at the moment it will not be possible on cars. Elon Musk stated so in a tweet.\nStarlink outlook\nGiven that broadband companies lack rivals in many cases, Starlink and other satellite internet constellations are a welcome injection of competition. More important, the service enables regions to get connected at broadband speeds where there were no options previously.\nFor example, the Hoh Tribe, a Native American tribe located in Western Washington state along the Pacific coast, said Starlink was like being \"catapulted into the 21st century.\" Per the Newsweek article, the Hoh Tribe tweeted that faster internet speeds helped with remote learning and access to healthcare.\nStarlink's wireless nature allows it to enter any part of the world, subverting the need for cables. By doing so, rural areas that remain neglected can now be connected at broadband speeds. The cost of $99 is still too high for many parts of the globe, but given that Starlink will see competition from other companies, prices will likely drop over time.\nElon Musk hopes to complete the Starlink internet constellation sometime in 2023.\nGet the BEST of Tom\u2019s Guide daily right in your inbox: Sign up now!\nUpgrade your life with the Tom\u2019s Guide newsletter.
