        "raw_content": "Guangdong Hypnuse Biotechnology Co.,Ltd. is an innovative technology enterprise established in January 2022 focusing on the field of healthy sleep. The company's products are guided by the concept of wearable intelligence, highlighting the application of research results in skin-friendly fit technology, assisted sleep methods, sleep monitoring technology, etc., and provide software and hardware solutions and finished product ODM services to global customers. Since its establishment, we have continuously optimized the design and implemented sleep experiments. The experimental results have resulted in the training and application of 11 traditional machine learning models and 1 deep learning model. In addition, it has achieved good results in the sensor fusion algorithm of heart rate, blood oxygen, body movement and respiration. Ultimately, we will explore and solve the two questions that clinical medicine is most concerned about: What auxiliary methods can help you fall asleep quickly? How to adjust according to the physiological signal monitoring results to improve the overall sleep quality? At the beginning of the company's preparations, it partnered with doctors from Tsinghua University to cultivate and build a professional R&D team. It has also cooperated with the sleep clinician team of the Fourth Affiliated Hospital of Zhejiang University and the algorithm team of the Department of Mathematics of Changsha University of Science & Technology, providing unlimited possibilities for realizing the beautiful vision of \"Let\u2019s be the real masters of sleep\".\nVision\nLet's be the real masters of sleep.\nMission\nOf those who have trouble sleeping globally,\nIt all began during the founder's inaugural overnight flight to Los Angeles, USA. The journey was turbulent, the cabin was clamorous, and the seating area was cramped, rendering sleep impossible. Upon arrival, tight work schedules combined with the disruptive effects of jet lag wreaked havoc on his sleep system, leaving him profoundly fatigued.\nSubsequently, on numerous long-haul trips to Europe and America, he tried various sleep aids in an attempt to combat the \"difficulty falling asleep\" and \"poor sleep quality\" caused by irregular sleep patterns. However, the results were minimal. Fueled by personal experience and a burst of inspiration, he conceived the idea of developing a product to address his own sleep issues, with the intention of assisting those who were enduring similar sleep troubles.\nHypnuse draws its inspiration from the Greek god of sleep \u201chypnos\u201d in ancient mythology. We seamlessly blend the mystique of mythology with a vast, ethereal aesthetic to create a brand of irresistible allure. Our hope is that every wearer can feel the blessings of the god of sleep and enjoy a truly restful experience.\nHypnuse goes beyond merely providing sleep assistance; it monitors your sleep patterns and even explores medical-grade solutions, aiming to elevate your sleep quality from every dimension. Whether it's a power nap during the day or a long night's rest, Hypnuse will always be by your side, crafting superior sleep experiences with you, so you can live a vibrant life.\nYou don\u2019t have an account yet ?

On April 12, 2017, Guangdong Hybribio Biotech Co., Ltd. (300639) went public and listed on the Growth Enterprise Market.\nWith independent innovation, Guangdong Hybribio Biotech Co., Ltd. was recognized as a high-tech enterprise in 2008 and an innovative enterprise in Guangdong Province in 2012. In the same year, they were approved by the Guangdong Provincial Department of Science and Technology, the National Development and Reform Commission, and the Economic and Information Commission to establish the \"Guangdong Province Molecular Diagnostic Engineering Technology Research and Development Center for Human Papillomavirus (HPV)-Related Diseases,\" becoming one of the few companies in the molecular diagnostic field with the capability to build a provincial-level research and development center. In 2013, they were approved by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Postdoctoral Management Committee to establish a postdoctoral research workstation. In September 2015, the National Strategic Emerging Industry Development Project - Guangdong Hybribio Biotech Chip Development Industrial Base was officially launched in the Guangzhou Sino-Singapore Knowledge City, combining industry, academia, and research to form a dual-chain development model with Hybribio's unique characteristics in the field of biotechnology.

Their proprietary hybridization technology platform, which has independent intellectual property rights, combines PCR amplification technology, molecular hybridization technology, and biochip technology, among other technological advantages, greatly improving clinical diagnostic efficiency and accuracy. Many laboratories worldwide have used Hybribio's products to participate in the World Health Organization (WHO) HPV Network Monitoring Assessment for six consecutive times, and the results fully meet the requirements of clinical application levels and laboratory capabilities.\nGuangdong Hybribio Biotech Co., Ltd. has long been involved in national and local government's two-cancer screening projects. They have jointly organized a three-year, 600-session national grassroots reproductive tract infection prevention and control training program with the National Health Commission and the Chinese Medical Association, providing guidance for clinical medication for grassroots doctors. Since 2011, they have jointly established the China (HPV) Database with the Medical and Health Science and Technology Development Research Center of the Ministry of Health, providing theoretical basis for cervical cancer prevention and control, vaccine development, and the formulation of cervical cancer public health policies.\nBuilding on the significant achievements in the industrialization of molecular diagnostics, the Hybribio Group has established over 30 molecular medical laboratories in Hong Kong and key cities across the country. With the brand image of \"Hybribio Medical Laboratory, Nucleic Acid Diagnostic Expert,\" they provide advanced molecular diagnostic technology services to grassroots medical institutions nationwide, expand their business downstream in the industry chain, and realize an integrated business model of \"platform + reagents + services.\"\nSince the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, relying on their deep experience in the field of nucleic acid molecular diagnostics in China, Guangdong Hybribio Biotech Co., Ltd. has independently developed a series of respiratory pathogen testing products and formed a comprehensive solution for COVID-19 virus testing. They use scientific and technological strength to safeguard the lives, health, and safety of the people. Their 32 Hybribio medical laboratories nationwide have become designated COVID-19 nucleic acid testing institutions by the National Health Commission. They actively responded to the government's call and participated in large-scale COVID-19 nucleic acid testing screenings in Guangdong, Hubei, Beijing, Xinjiang, Liaoning, Hong Kong, Yunnan, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Nanjing, Hunan, Chongqing, Henan, Shanghai, Fujian, Shaanxi, Guangxi, and other regions. In multiple nationwide screening tasks, they have built the \"Puji\" pneumatic laboratory and the \"Kaixuan\" cabin laboratory, improved local nucleic acid testing capabilities, successfully completed screening tasks, and received praise and recognition from local governments. They have also accumulated a large amount of rich experience in COVID-19 screening work in different application scenarios.\nAs a mission-driven and responsible national brand enterprise, Guangdong Hybribio Biotech Co., Ltd. will continue to play an active role in promoting the development of the medical and health industry together with the biotechnology industry.\nHeadquarters\nD5-3-3-4 Comm.
