The forward-looking outlook provides insight into the anticipated performance of the food and beverage industry throughout 2024, pointing to a more favorable landscape as several headwinds that weighed down 2023 are expected to recede.\nHigh inflation is anticipated to ease considerably next year, and the impact of increased mobility on retail food and beverage consumption will likely be less pronounced. In addition, our research shows that several factors will impact food and beverage growth throughout 2024, including an improving macroeconomic environment and growing promotional investments.\n\u201cAmid shifting consumer preferences and evolving market dynamics, our food and beverage outlook not only highlights key growth opportunities for 2024 but reveals a cautiously optimistic outlook as we emerge from a myriad of challenges that the industry has faced over the past several years,\u201d said Sally Lyons Wyatt, executive vice president and practice leader, Circana. \u201cWith continued innovation and adaptability, retailers and manufacturers will be poised to position themselves for success in the coming year and beyond.\u201d\nOur research indicates that specific departments are expected to lead the pack in volume growth. Circana predicts the beverage and deli sectors will carry on outperforming overall food and beverage unit sales in 2024. One factor likely driving beverage growth is an increase in health-conscious consumers seeking more protein and energy options in their diet. Another likely factor fueling beverage sales increase is that it has had more innovation than other departments, which delivered excitement and encouraged category exploration.\nIn the deli aisle, convenient grab-and-go options will likely continue driving sales as consumers prioritize meal options that address diverse needs. Shifting consumer preferences in other departments throughout the store will likely put pressure on unit growth. To succeed in 2024, our research indicates that perimeter aisles will need to optimize turnkey options for on-the-go consumers. In the frozen department, assortments should be reevaluated both in-store and online to ensure a variety of products are available to meet consumers\u2019 needs. Consumers will likely look to the center store for solutions that deliver convenience, quality, and value.\nCircana\u2019s 2024 food and beverage outlook was developed using econometric demand models leveraging Circana\u2019s Demand Forecasting Platform. Over 100 variables were analyzed to test hypotheses for each model, supported by a machine-learning algorithm and over 500 random forest models to determine the most important causal factors.

        "raw_content": "Circana\u2019s 2024 Food and Beverage Outlook Predicts Modest Volume Growth Following Three-Year Decline\nChicago, Nov.\n06, 2023\n(GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Circana\u2122, formerly IRI and The NPD Group, today released its 2024 food and beverage outlook, revealing that modest food and beverage volume growth is expected next year after three consecutive years of volume declines. The forward-looking outlook provides insight into the anticipated performance of the food and beverage industry throughout 2024, pointing to a more favorable landscape as several headwinds that weighed down 2023 are expected to recede.\nHigh inflation is anticipated to ease considerably next year, and the impact of increased mobility on retail food and beverage consumption will likely be less pronounced. In addition, our research shows that several factors will impact food and beverage growth throughout 2024, including an improving macroeconomic environment and growing promotional investments.\n\u201cAmid shifting consumer preferences and evolving market dynamics, our food and beverage outlook not only highlights key growth opportunities for 2024 but reveals a cautiously optimistic outlook as we emerge from a myriad of challenges that the industry has faced over the past several years,\u201d said Sally Lyons Wyatt, executive vice president and practice leader, Circana. \u201cWith continued innovation and adaptability, retailers and manufacturers will be poised to position themselves for success in the coming year and beyond.\u201d\nOur research indicates that specific departments are expected to lead the pack in volume growth. Circana predicts the beverage and deli sectors will carry on outperforming overall food and beverage unit sales in 2024. One factor likely driving beverage growth is an increase in health-conscious consumers seeking more protein and energy options in their diet. Another likely factor fueling beverage sales increase is that it has had more innovation than other departments, which delivered excitement and encouraged category exploration.\nIn the deli aisle, convenient grab-and-go options will likely continue driving sales as consumers prioritize meal options that address diverse needs. Shifting consumer preferences in other departments throughout the store will likely put pressure on unit growth. To succeed in 2024, our research indicates that perimeter aisles will need to optimize turnkey options for on-the-go consumers. In the frozen department, assortments should be reevaluated both in-store and online to ensure a variety of products are available to meet consumers\u2019 needs. Consumers will likely look to the center store for solutions that deliver convenience, quality, and value.\nCircana\u2019s 2024 food and beverage outlook was developed using econometric demand models leveraging Circana\u2019s Demand Forecasting Platform. Over 100 variables were analyzed to test hypotheses for each model, supported by a machine-learning algorithm and over 500 random forest models to determine the most important causal factors. The models were finalized based on their best fit, significance levels, and intuitive insights. Forward-looking input variable assumptions were developed using historical trends and insight from industry experts. This platform allows Circana to run scenarios and estimate future sales, breaking them down by their driving factors.\nFor more about Circana\u2019s 2024 outlook for the food and beverage industry, please contact Sally Lyons Wyatt.\nAbout CircanaCircana is the leading advisor on the complexity of consumer behavior.

This year\u2019s growth will come by the third quarter after continued declines early in the year.\n\u201cConsumers continued to spend fewer total dollars on tech products in 2023 through a combination of falling prices and shifting share of wallet to services and core needs,\u201d Paul Gagnon, VP and technology industry advisor for Circana, said in a statement.\nGagnon believes consumer purchases will ramp up in late 2024 for key large-dollar categories such as computers.\nIndeed, the computer category will account for almost half of the $1.7 billion consumer technology industry growth expected this year. Circana also anticipates unit sales of TVs and home automation devices will remain positive throughout the forecast period. TV unit sales are expected to grow by low single digits year over year through 2026 as larger sizes become more affordable and economic headwinds ease, allowing more growth in premium price points.\nBen Arnold, executive director and CE analyst with Circana, contends that new product launches in computing, virtual reality (VR) and home automation, can help to reignite demand and give consumers fresh reasons to spend on consumer technology products.\n\u201cNew technologies also typically sell for higher prices, which should provide additional industry sales support,\u201d Arnold said in a statement.\nSubscribe HERE to the FREE Media Play News Daily Newsletter!\nRelated Posts\nHeading into the annual CES trade show this week in Las Vegas, research group Circana\u00a0 announced its 2024 Consumer Electronics (CE) Industry Performance Awards \u2014 led by South Korean consumer electronics manufacturer Samsung, which topped the largest market share increases\u2026\nFollowing tremendous growth fueled by pandemic needs in 2020 and 2021, U.S. consumer technology industry sales revenue is expected to end 2022 down 8% year over year, according to The NPD Group.
