        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly.

Charter's Ba2 Corporate Family Rating (CFR), Ba2-PD Probability of Default Rating (PDR), and all instrument ratings are unaffected by the proposed Transaction. The stable outlook and SGL-1 speculative grade liquidity are unchanged.Assignments:..Issuer: Charter Communications Operating, LLC....Senior Secured 1st Lien Notes, Assigned Ba1 (LGD3)Moody's expects the terms and conditions of the newly issued obligation to be materially the same as existing obligations of the same class. Charter intends to use the net proceeds from the financing for general corporate purposes, share repurchases, to repay certain indebtedness, and to pay related fees and expenses. Moody's believes any incremental leverage (net of repayment) will not materially change the credit profile or the proportional mix of secured and unsecured debt, or the resultant creditor claim priorities in the capital structure.RATINGS RATIONALECharter's credit profile is supported by its substantial scale and share of the US broadband market, protected by a superior, high-speed network with limited competitive overlap. Charter is the second largest cable company in the United States, serving approximately 32.1 million residential and commercial customers across 41 states, generating approximately $51.7 billion in revenue (FY 2021). Strong and sustained broadband demand drives growth and profitability, providing an operating hedge to the secular decline in video and wireline voice services. The business model is also highly predictable, with a largely recurring revenue base. Liquidity is very good, supported by free cash flows which are close to $8.6 billion (Moody's adjusted, FY 2021), providing significant financial flexibility.The credit profile is constrained by governance risk, including a financial policy that targets a net leverage ratio of 4.0-4.5x, managed near the top end of the range (near 4.7x on Moody's adjusted gross debt basis for FY 2021). Despite the ability to de-lever, most free cash flow has been used for share repurchases. The Company generally raises debt to maintain pace with EBITDA growth, driving already high absolute debt levels (over $93 billion, Moody's adjusted at Q4 2021), ever higher. However, Moody's expects maturity ladders will continue to be managed prudently. Charter is exposed to secular pressure in its wireline voice and video services which are losing customers due to competition and changes in media consumption, driving penetration rates lower. Moody's also views broadband wireless technology, specifically terrestrial 5G, as a potential threat to a portion of the Company's wireline broadband business over the medium term. To manage the risk, and participate in the opportunity, Charter is ramping its own wireless services as a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). While the wireless service has experienced rapid growth and is driving the top-line, steady-state economics at scale will be less favorable than its existing cable business model (including data, video and voice combined).The SGL-1 liquidity rating reflects very good liquidity with strong free cash flow, a partially drawn $4.75 billion revolving credit facility, and only incurrence-based financial covenants. Alternate liquidity is limited with a largely secured capital structure.Moody's rates the senior secured 1st lien credit facilities and senior secured 1st lien notes at Charter Communications Operating, LLC, Time Warner Cable LLC, and Time Warner Cable Enterprises LLC Ba1 (LGD3), one notch above the Ba2 CFR. Secured lenders benefit from junior capital provided by the senior unsecured notes issued at CCO Holdings, LLC and CCO Holdings Capital Corp (which have no guarantees), the most junior claims and rated B1 (LGD5), with contractual and structural subordination to all other obligations. Instrument ratings reflect the Ba2-PD probability of default rating with a mix of secured and unsecured debt, which we expect will result in an average rate of recovery of approximately 50% in a distressed scenario.The stable outlook reflects our expectation that debt will rise to over $100 billion and revenues and EBITDA will range between $56-$57 billion and $22-23 billion, respectively by the end of 2022. Moody's projects EBITDA margins approaching 40%, producing free cash flows of between $7-$8 billion annually. Key assumptions include capex to revenue averaging near 15%, and average borrowing costs of approximately 5%. Moody's expects video and voice subscribers to fall by low to mid-single digit percent on a long-term secular basis, and data subscribers to rise by low to mid-single digit percent. Moody's expects leverage to remain in the mid to high 4x range (Moody's adjusted gross debt/EBITDA), and free cash flow to debt to be sustained in the high single-digit percent range. Moody's expects liquidity to remain very good.Note: all figures are Moody's adjusted, over the next 12-18 months unless otherwise noted.FACTORS THAT COULD LEAD TO AN UPGRADE OR DOWNGRADE OF THE RATINGMoody's could consider an upgrade if:\u0095 Leverage (Moody's adjusted debt/EBITDA) is sustained below 4.25x, and\u0095 Free cash flow-to-debt (Moody's adjusted) is sustained above 5%An upgrade could also be conditional on maintaining very good liquidity, a more conservative financial policy, and stable operating performance.Moody's could consider a downgrade if:\u0095 Leverage (Moody's adjusted debt/EBITDA) is sustained above 4.75x, or\u0095 Free cash flow-to-debt (Moody's adjusted) is sustained below low single digit percentMoody's could also consider a negative rating action if liquidity deteriorated, financial policy implied higher credit risk, or there were unfavorable and sustained trends in operating performance or the business model.Charter Communications, Inc., headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut, provides video, data, phone, and wireless services. Across its footprint, which spans 41 states, Charter serves 32.1 million residential and commercial customers under the Spectrum brand, making it the second-largest U.S. cable operator. Revenue for the year ended 31 Dec 2021 was approximately $51.7 billion. Charter is a public company.

        "raw_content": "Charter plots 3-year upgrade to deploy DOCSIS 4.0 by 2025\nWith a new CEO at the helm, Charter Communications unveiled an ambitious plan to overhaul its network over the next three years, aiming to offer download speeds of 5 Gbps across the vast majority of footprint and top tier speeds of 10 Gbps by 2025. Notably, it is hoping to do so at a $100 cost per passing.\nRich DiGeronimo, Charter\u2019s president of Product and Technology, explained during an investor day event that the upgrades will be completed in three phases and eventually touch its entire footprint of 55 million passings.\nThe first phase will see Charter implement high-split architecture to increase its usable spectrum to 1.2 GHz across 15% of its footprint. This change, which began in four mid-sized markets this year and will continue through 2023, will enable speeds of 2 Gbps downstream and 1 Gbps upstream. Phase 2 will begin in early 2024 and will see Charter continue its high-split upgrades but modify its approach to roll out distributed access architecture (DAA) using Remote PHY. This phase will cover another 50% of its footprint and will allow the operator to boost downstream speeds to 5 Gbps.\nCharter will move into Phase 3 in late 2024, deploying extended spectrum DOCSIS 4.0 (ESD) in the remaining 35% of its footprint to enable download speeds of up to 10 Gbps. Between all the cable upgrades, DiGeronimo said Charter expects to be able to offer 5/1 Gbps speeds to 85% of its footprint by the end of 2025. He added the operator also plans to offer a fiber-on-demand product which will be capable of delivering symmetrical speeds of 25 Gbps or more to customers who want it.\nWhile fiber competitors are deploying new infrastructure at a cost of between $500 and $1500 per passing, DiGeronimo said Charter will be able to get into multi-gig territory for around $100 per home, though unlike fiber its offering will be asymmetrical. That puts the total cost of its upgrade plan at $5.5 billion.\nAccording to DiGeronimo, the $100 figure factors in module swaps, the use of in-house labor for the upgrades and the assumption that Charter can purchase all the 1.8 GHz kit it will need for the DOCSIS 4.0 rollout for the same cost as the 1.2 GHz components it buys.\nDiGeronimo acknowledged the latter is an \u201caggressive target\u201d but added \u201cthis is a large scale deployment that\u2019s going to be done over three years, so this is going to be very lucrative for those vendors that choose to partner with us.\u201d\nRelated\nCharter\u2019s plans is notably different from that of fellow cable giant Comcast, which is planning to deploy full duplex (FDX) DOCSIS 4.0 starting in the second half of 2023 and deliver symmetrical multi-gig services to 56 million locations by the end of 2025 at a less than $200 cost per passing.\nExpansion and competition\nIn addition to upgrading the\u00a0network, Charter is also looking to expand it through a combination of grant-fueled builds, line extensions and edge outs. It is already working to reach 1 million new locations with money from the Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF) and has won state-level grants for another 160,000 passings. CFO Jessica Fischer said it has pending grant applications for another 300,000 passings. And that\u2019s doesn't account for the project awards it could win through the $42.5 billion Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program.\nBeyond rural-focused work, CEO Chris Winfrey said there is also plenty of opportunity for Charter to ramp greenfield builds and fill in its existing footprint.\nWinfrey noted Charter is also looking to bolster its Spectrum packaging with improved wireless and Wi-Fi services. The operator has previously said it might roll out its own cell sites using CBRS spectrum, but executives added on the call it is also exploring potential partnerships with Comcast and other operators which would allow its mobile customers to connect to their Wi-Fi networks.\nRelated\nPutting it all together, Winfrey argued Charter's suite of enhanced services - delivered through its $50 per month\u00a0fixed-mobile Spectrum One bundle\u00a0-\u00a0will be hard to compete with.\n\u201cOur largest competitors, they have wireless marketed nationwide but the reality is they don\u2019t have a wireline footprint or a sufficient wireline footprint to be able to marry it up and provide that converged product,\u201d Winfrey said. \u201cTake AT&T. Big national wireless operator, but their wireline coverage is what, maybe 40%, of which a third maybe is upgraded. So, they don\u2019t have a path to a ubiquitously converged product today, [and] as far as I can see they don\u2019t have a path to that in the future.\u201d\n\u201cEven if they could, remember 70% roughly of their revenue is tied to mobile at very high prices. So, it\u2019s very difficult for them to follow where we go,\u201d he concluded, adding many other fiber players don\u2019t have a wireless service at all."

Rating Triggers Loosened On Secular Shift Toward Broadband; 'BB+' Rating Affirmed\nInstant Insights: Key Takeaways From Our Research\nChina's RMB350 Billion Policy Push May Help Developer Destocking\nNew Management And Governance Scores Assigned To 53 Issuers In The U.S. Telecommunications Sector\nNew Management And Governance Scores Assigned To 83 Issuers In The U.S. Media Sector\nResearch Update: Charter Communications Inc. Rating Triggers Loosened On Secular Shift Toward Broadband; 'BB+' Rating Affirmed\nWe believe Charter's broadband competitive advantage will be magnified from continued increases in data consumption. \u00a0Americans increasingly rely on fast internet connections to use over-the-top video platforms, conduct virtual business meetings, interact socially, and educate remotely. We believe the secular shift toward higher-speed broadband will persist beyond the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated these inevitable trends. Charter faces competition capable of delivering comparable speeds (of up to 1Gbps) in only 25%-30% of its footprint, and we do not expect the competitive landscape to change significantly over the next three to five years. Therefore, as consumers demand more bandwidth, we expect Charter to grow its broadband penetration levels, while also benefiting from opportunities to raise prices as customers move to higher-speed tiers.\nWe view favorably the mix shift toward less competitive, higher-margin broadband and away from traditional video. \u00a0We believe the predictability in Charter's earnings and cash flow has improved significantly, despite greater concentration in a single service. Broadband profit margins are very high because the costs are fixed and largely sunk. Furthermore, churn is low because the competing phone company offers far inferior speeds in most of Charter's footprint. In contrast, Charter faces direct competition from satellite TV providers Dish and DirecTV, as well as a plethora of new online entrants, for video service. Furthermore, rising programming costs have pressured video margins and resulted in heightened industrywide cord-cutting.\nAs the mix shift in earnings skews toward broadband, total earnings have grown. Therefore, we believe Charter has greater long-term cash flow stability as high-speed data (HSD) constitutes a higher percentage of a larger earnings pool.\nCharter's free operating cash flow (FOCF) to debt ratio has steadily improved. \u00a0Growth in cash flow has come from a combination of:\nHowever, we expect the pace of FOCF improvement to slow, particularly in 2022, because:\nWe view Charter's strategy of maximizing unit growth as prudent because it provides a visible pathway to maximize return on investment. \u00a0Management has not been as aggressive with pricing as many other cable operators. Instead, it is focusing on increasing its subscriber base. In fact, Charter's 8% HSD subscriber growth in 2020 was the best in the industry, and it resulted in HSD penetration rising to about 54% from 51% in 2019. Given the low operating costs associated with delivering broadband, maximizing EBITDA per home passed is strategic, as opposed to focusing primarily on EBITDA per customer. Furthermore, focusing on unit growth should allow Charter to increase average revenue per user (ARPU) across a wider customer base for the future when subscriber growth eventually plateaus. We believe this tactical strategy--coupled with favorable industry dynamics and Charter's slightly more rural and somewhat less competitive footprint than other large incumbent operators--should allow for strong near-term earnings growth.\nHowever, Charter has lower profitability metrics than other top-ranked peers. \u00a0Charter lowered its cost structure through the complex integration of Time Warner Cable and BrightHouse (acquired in 2016) by consolidating billing platforms, migrating to an all-digital network, and applying uniform pricing and packaging across its footprint. However, the company's EBITDA margins and EBITDA per home passed still lag other scaled operators because its prices tend to be lower. We attribute some of this to less favorable demographics, as the average adjusted gross income per household is around $80,000 for Comcast and Altice USA compared with about $70,000 for Charter. Also, both peers operate in more densely populated footprints, which allow more efficient allocation of overhead. Still, we believe Charter has improved its operating efficiency as its non-programming operating expenses per home passed are slightly below Comcast (at $348 vs $356, respectively, per year). While its non-programming operating expenses (as a percentage of sales) are higher 38.6% vs 35.4% we believe this largely reflects different operating strategies, whereby Charter is more focused on unit growth.\nComcast Corp.\nCharter Communications Inc.\nAltice USA Inc.\nCable One Inc.\nOverall, we rank Charter slightly behind Comcast in terms of business strength.\nWhile both companies embrace a connectivity-first strategy and have a similar product suite (including using wireless as a retention tool), Comcast has taken a more expansive view: It could leverage its significant technology investments to focus on the customer experience to strengthen its connectivity offering. It has embraced the aggregator role through its \"Flex\" service. We believe Flex differentiates Comcast's broadband service and creates avenues for future monetization, such as through advertising. Comcast could leverage its technology platform, its media assets, and its relationships across media and streaming\nacross the U.S., and increasingly across the world. Still, we view Comcast's NBCU and Sky less favorably than its cable operations, and they weigh on the rating threshold.\nComcast's strategy has resulted in stronger customer and profitability metrics largely stemming from a greater emphasis on bundled customers (60% vs 55%) and better monetization of services such as advertising, business services, home security, and technology licensing.\nWe believe the risk of pricing regulation is low over the next 2-3 years but still presents a long-term overhang.\u00a0The vast majority of Charter's markets are still deemed competitive with two carriers able to offer the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's (FCC) definition of broadband (25 Mbps downloads/3 Mbps uploads). With the new administration, the FCC will likely restore cable operators as \"common carriers\" under Title II of the 1996 Telecom Act to enforce net neutrality principles of no blocking, no throttling, and no paid prioritization of traffic. The reclassification to Title II also reintroduces the potential for price regulation through the general conduct standard, which provides leeway for the FCC to regulate what it deems to be unfair or unjust practices.\nWe view the reclassification to \"common carriers\" under Title II as less of a threat to cable operators because it will be time-consuming to draft an order, it will likely be appealed, and a future FCC administration can flip back to the lightly regulated Title I designation. Additionally, over the next few years we believe the FCC will be more focused on increasing broadband availability and affordability through consumer subsidy programs. By introducing price regulation, it could discourage network investments at a time when expanded broadband access is a key focus of the government. Furthermore, when internet service providers (ISP) were classified under Title II during the Obama administration, the FCC did not regulate broadband pricing but rather focused on a free and open internet. Today, there appears to be more government focus on large tech players around censorship and data protections than on cable infrastructure companies.\nLonger term, the implementation and enforcement of government-mandated price caps represents one of the biggest threats to the industry, in our view. We believe as penetration rates increase and ARPU rises, cable operators could come under increasing regulatory scrutiny.\nThe stable outlook reflects our expectation that Charter could reduce leverage by at least 0.5x per year but that it will continue to repurchase stock and/or make acquisitions such that leverage remains toward the high end of its targeted 4.0x-4.5x range.\nWe could raise the rating if our view of Charter's operations improves, specifically if Charter increases customer penetration and improves its operating efficiency such that EBITDA margins increase to the low-40% area and EBITDA per home passed exceeds $400 per year. Alternatively, we could raise the rating if management revises its financial policy to include a commitment to keep debt to EBITDA below 4.25x on a sustained basis.\nWe could lower the rating if debt to EBITDA exceeds 5x on a sustained basis, which would most likely reflect a more aggressive financial policy. We view this as unlikely given management's history and commitment to keep leverage at 4.5x or below.\nStamford, Conn.-based Charter is the second-largest U.S. cable operator (behind Comcast). It serves more than 31 million customers, and it is capable of serving an addressable market of about 53 million homes and businesses. Charter's primary offerings consist of cable TV, internet, and phone connections. On Dec. 31, 2020, Charter had about 29 million broadband subscribers, 16 million video customers, and 10 million voice customers. In 2018, Charter also launched a mobile service through a wholesale agreement (also known as a mobile virtual network operator with Verizon and had 2.4 million mobile lines as of Dec. 31, 2020.\nThese assumptions result in the following credit metrics:\nIssuer credit rating: BB+/Stable/--\nBusiness risk: Strong\nFinancial risk: Aggressive\nAnchor: bb+\nModifiers:\nCharter Communications Inc.\nCCO Holdings Capital Corp.\nCCO Holdings LLC\nCCOH Safari, LLC\nCharter Communications Operating Capital Corp.\nCharter Communications Operating LLC\nTime Warner Cable LLC\nTime Warner Entertainment Co.
