A Case Western Reserve graduate student and alumnus partnered to design their quarter-size 3D-printed violins that are more affordable.\nThe instruments are 3D-printed from a plastic that is chemically stable and thermally resistant, allowing them to more likely maintain their tune even after being exposed to heat or cold.\nThe quarter-size was designed to fit the smaller hands of younger violin players.\nReflexion Interactive\nReflexion Interactive returned to CES to emphasize connected neuro-fitness technology to improve athletic performance.\nThe Reflexion Edge is a cognitive screening and brain training devise that helps set a baseline for cognitive abilities and trains the user to improve speed and memory. With a touchscreen lightboard and data analytics, Reflexion strengthens abilities such as peripheral vision, reaction time, decision making and hand-eye coordination.\nIt can also be applied for physical rehabilitation and allows doctors to track changes for patients and keep patients engaged and informed of their own progress.\nLearn more about other CES 2021 exhibitors from Case Western Reserve University, including a space-age alloy making non-rubber tires, a fabric sensor and many more.\nAround the World with CES 2021 Exhibitors\nStartups Bring Ideas to Life at CES 2021\nCES\u00ae, owned and produced by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA)\u00ae, is the most influential tech event in the world \u2014 the proving ground for breakthrough technologies and global innovators.\nBecome a CTA Member\nAbout CES\nCES Events\nInnovation Awards\nCES Tech Talk Podcast\nPromote Your Brand\nTopics\nArticles\nCES Success Stories\nSchedule\nOur Partners\nInformation for:\nExhibitors\nMedia\nInternational\nFollow CES\nCode of Conduct\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy\nSitemap\nCopyright \u00a9 2003 - 2024.
