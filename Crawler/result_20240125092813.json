Subscribe now.\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Policies You may unsubscribe at any time.\nSwedish clean technology startup Exeger has showcased its novel solar cell technology at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024. A range of products that includes the company's light-powered material from Adidas, Philips, 3M, and Urbanista is on display at the event.\nThis material, Powerfoyle, is the world's only fully customizable solar cell and enables the conversion of all forms of light into electrical energy. Powerfoyle's design characteristics also allow it to be effortlessly incorporated into any electronic device.\nExeger claims that Powerfoyle elevates the performance of any incorporated product by providing prolonged or potentially limitless battery longevity, delivering the capabilities of advanced solar cell technology directly to individuals. \"Exeger is leading the way to energy independence through more sustainable and user-friendly products \u2014 with the vision to touch the lives of a billion people by 2030,\" said the firm's website.\nSuperior design\nIn reimagining the traditional dye-sensitized cell (DSC), the firm harnessed the strengths of existing solar cell technology. Further, it enhanced indoor and outdoor efficiency, increasing flexibility and introducing superior design capabilities. Powerfoyle's structure eliminates the necessity for silver conductors and expands the functional surface area, even in partial shading conditions.\nExeger\nPowerfoyle's DSC monolith features a distinctive conductive electrode material that replaces the conventional, costly, and inefficient indium-tin-oxide layer. \"By removing the need for silver lines, we have achieved superior design qualities, and we offer nearly 100 percent active area \u2013 creating endless opportunities and business advantages for our partners and their products,\" said the company's website.\nMoreover, the Powerfoyle solar cell boasts a slender profile \u2013 as thin as 1.3 mm, depending on the structure \u2013 while maintaining durability and flexibility, setting it apart from conventional solar cells. The Powerfoyle cell can also be produced in sizes ranging from 15cm\u00b2 to 500cm\u00b2. \"Thanks to its exceptional qualities, it is flexible enough to be bent and can be printed in any form. We can seamlessly integrate Powerfoyle into any product, supporting with endless energy,\" said Exerger's website.\nDiverse applications\nThe duration of battery life poses a significant concern for consumers of headphones and earphones. Research indicates that battery life is the second most crucial factor influencing purchasing decisions. Being the world's sole fully customizable solar cell, Powerfoyle is ideal for powering audio products with diverse design needs. It seamlessly integrates into over-ear, on-ear, and charging cases for true wireless earbuds, according to Exeger.\nPowerfoyle's application can extend to portable speakers, e-readers, and computer accessories. IoT devices can also use this technology to power devices like sensors, remotes, and electronic shelf labels. The firm also aims to use Powerfoyle to power warning systems on helmets, safety vests, and hearing protectors in the future.\nExeger\nExeger is expanding its production capabilities at Stockholm II, the company's second urban factory. Upon reaching full-scale operation, Stockholm II will empower Exeter to manufacture a maximum of 2.5 million square meters of its patented solar cells annually.\nOn display at CES 2024, the Urbanista Los Angeles headphones and Urbanista Phoenix earphones, comprising the second generation, have paved the path for the evolution of light-powered audio products. Urbanista's latest release builds upon the success of the world's initial light-powered headphones and earphones incorporating Powerfoyle solar cell technology, initially introduced in 2021 and 2022.\n3M unveiled the world's inaugural self-charging protective communications headset, capable of transforming both outdoor and indoor light into renewable electrical energy for the first time. This headset employs Powerfoyle technology to replenish an integrated lithium-ion battery, eradicating the necessity for disposable batteries.\nPhilips has also featured two self-powered innovations, including a television remote and sports headphones, both energized by light using Powerfoyle. Furthermore, a hearing aid from Voxx under the RCA brand and a concept for a self-powered speaker from Tymphany are also on display at CES 2024."
