        "raw_content": "LG H&H Co., Ltd.\nCompany Background\nLG Household & Health Care is one of the largest household goods and cosmetics manufacturers in South Korea and ranks second in cosmetics in the country after AmorePacific Group. The company's cosmetics sales via duty-free shops have increased steadily due to a growing number of visitors from abroad. In addition, it has recently been active in mergers and acquisitions of domestic and foreign cosmetics brands. These factors have helped the cosmetics division gain a higher percentage of consolidated sales than the household goods division.\nIn 2001, LG Household & Health Care was established as a spinoff from LG Chem, taking over the cosmetics business from its parent LG group, one of South Korea's global conglomerates, which started out as a cosmetics producer. The company is built around three core divisions: detergent and other household goods, cosmetics and soft drinks, and its overseas operations focused on cosmetics.\nThe company is enjoying brisk demand for its high-end cosmetics brands at home and in China, including the Whoo line, based on traditional Korean herbal medicine, and Sum 37, a brand that uses naturally-fermented plants from around the world, at home and in China. The Face Shop, the low-cost brand acquired by LG Household, has proved popular with young Asian consumers. Meanwhile, the Korean company is preparing to keep pace with the era of an aging society through its Japanese subsidary, EverLife, that sells inner beauty products and health products.\nLG Household & Health Care Vice Chairman Cha Suk-yong, who previously worked for U.S. consumer products maker Procter & Gamble, serves as CEO of the South Korean company. The company is vigorously pursuing new product development under the leadership of Cha, who is noted for his P&G-style management approach emphasizing innovation.\nDiscover the all new Nikkei Asia app\nNikkei Asian Review, now known as Nikkei Asia, will be the voice of the Asian Century.\nCelebrate our next chapter\nFree access for everyone - Sep. 30"

The land is currently undeveloped, and the filings don\u2019t detail how many buildings the company would be looking to construct. The commission is due to meet to discuss the proposal later this week.\nThe application was submitted by DuPont co-founder Lammot J. du Pont and Vizsla Ventures LLC and includes references to a company known as Vu Ventures LLC. However, a now-removed internal company magazine from engineering firm Gordon Inc. -- which is featured in the planning documents as involved in the project -- notes the connection between the Dulles Berry project and CloudHQ.\nAs part of the original 2018 proposal for data centers on the site \u2013 seemingly filed by an affiliate of QTS \u2013 the owners dedicated a 100-foot wide corridor along the eastern boundary line of the Property immediately adjacent to the Board Run to the county.\nPlans for a Dulles Berry campus have seemingly been in the works since around 2018, according to other filings with the county; it has undergone several revisions involving the site's visual and environmental impacts. The site is features Digital Realty data center campuses to the west and north.\nDuPont Fabros Technology co-founder and CEO Hossein Fateh stepped down from the company in February 2015, and in 2016 founded CloudHQ. The company says it has built and leased 2.4 million square feet and 320MW of data center capacity since its formation. In 2020 Fateh formed Cloud Capital to acquire, manage, develop, and operate data centers.\nCloudHQ has existing and planned data center developments in Ashburn and Manassas, Virginia; London, UK; Milan, Italy; Frankfurt, Germany; and S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. The company is in the process of developing large-scale campuses in Mount Prospect, Illinois, and outside Paris, France.\nSubscribe to our daily newsletters\nMore in North America\nDCD>Connect | New York 2024 Delegate List\nAccelevation Holdings forms data center-focused business unit\nDiscussion\nVIP Private Dinner - by invitation only\nMore in Construction & Site Selection\nData Center Construction Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nCyrusOne seeks planning permission for Dublin data center\nEpisode\nPanel: What really needs to be adapted to accommodate AI at scale & pace\nTags\nWhitepapers\nMore\nImproving data center reliability and efficiency by solving power quality pain points\nSignificant Advancements in Rack PDU Power Quality\nData Center Sustainability Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWorkload Placement Trends \u2013 Survey Report\nWatch Now: Building a digital society - What market trends will be driving the industry forward?\nBrowse by Topic\nBrowse by Region\nProducts\nData Centre Dynamics Ltd (DCD), 296-300 St John St, London EC1V 4PAEmail.
