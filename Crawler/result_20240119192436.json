        "raw_content": "CES 2024: 'Jaws' pinball table is here to remind us 'Jaws' rules\nThe thing about Jaws is it's one of the greatest movies ever made. So, when someone decides to make a big table that does Jaws things loudly and repeatedly, I'm all in.\nLuckily, that's exactly what we're getting from pinball machine manufacturer Stern. The latest license from the folks behind Jurassic Park and Godzilla and countless other pinball classics got announced last week, and was available for hands-on play at CES 2024.\nAfter a brief hands-on session, my verdict is that Jaws is still great, and anything that reminds us of the greatness of Jaws is also cool.\nIt's a pinball shark, there has to be a twist\nI have to be clear about something up front: I'm more of a Jaws guy than a pinball guy. I'll indulge in the odd game or two at a bar every blue moon, but video games are more my bag.\nSo it's hard for me to critically evaluate Jaws as a pinball game. My time with it was brief and took place on a cacophonous show floor where learning the mechanics involved was next to impossible. It's got all kinds of flippers, spinners and ramps and other things that make pinball fun. That much I can tell you.\nI can also tell you that the shark emerges from the top of the playing field to wreak havoc, and that's rad. This happened often enough to be fun but not so often that it got old.\nPerhaps more importantly, the Jaws side of Jaws is respectful to the original. John Williams' iconic score is included, as are beautiful portraits of Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss. They actually got Dreyfuss to record some new voiceover for the game, too, though I couldn't exactly hear it. Did I mention the CES show floor is noisy?\nStill, the play field is immensely fun to look at. Quint's boat, the Orca, is included, as are references to the film's July 4th setting and various kinds of sharks for all the finheads out there. It's a delight.\nNow for the bad news: Jaws costs a lot of money if you want to actually own it. It starts at $6,999 for the starter edition and goes all the way up to $12,999 for all the bells and whistles (which I was told are cosmetic in nature and don't affect gameplay).\nI can't exactly recommend the table at that price point, but maybe you have a friend who owns a pinball arcade, or a movie fan with space in their garage. Kindly and gently cajole them into buying it. Just don't yell to the neighbors about it, or you'll have a panic on your hands.\nTopics\nCES\nGaming"

The company\u2019s latest game is a love letter to the blockbuster film, plus it includes voice acting from Richard Dreyfuss screaming \u201cmulti-ball.\u201d \u2014 Kyle Barr\nHP Omen Transcend 14\nHP Omen Transcend 14\nHP completely redesigned its Omen gaming laptop to be far smaller and far cuter than its previous 16-inch version. It\u2019s still packing an Intel Core Ultra CPU and Nvidia Geforce 4000 GPU, but it\u2019s all contained in a rather thin design that gets extra props for its full LED keyboard. We\u2019ll need to run full experiments to see how much all this power it\u2019s packing translates into battery life or extra heat. \u2014 Kyle Barr\nMSI Claw\nMSI Claw\nMSI was the first PC maker of the year to show off its own Steam Deck-like handheld console, and already it\u2019s a contender. It\u2019s sporting an Intel chip rather than AMD, which means we\u2019ll get to test how that company\u2019s APUs perform compared to the Steam Deck or ROG Ally. Plus, it has a lot of colorful LEDs in both the joysticks and face buttons. \u2014 Kyle Barr\nRazer\u2019s Prototype Haptic Chair\nRazer\u2019s Prototype Haptic Chair\nRazer is on the right track to\na haptic system that is comfortable, subtle, and effective. The Esther concept isn\u2019t commercially available, but I\u2019m already very intrigued by its audio-to-haptics system that seamlessly translates the sounds of games into a sensation rolling across your back. \u2014 Kyle Barr\nC-Seed N1 Folding MicroLED TV\nC-Seed N1 Folding MicroLED TV\nThe N1 is a 137-inch MicroLED 4K TV capable of folding itself back into its base and turning into a modern art piece in your living room. Basically, it is a dream for interior decorators of the rich and famous. It uses something called \u2018Adaptive Gap Calibration\u2019 that increases brightness around the edges of each panel, essentially making gaps invisible. It\u2019s similar to what you see on big LED walls at concerts. Oh, and did I mention it retails for $220k? \u2014 Jorge Jimenez\nSamsung\u2019s Ballie\nSamsung\u2019s Ballie\nSamsung\u2019s latest, roundest robot practically took over CES once it debuted Monday. The ball-shaped bot is supposed to be a household companion acting as a kind of mobile Siri with a built-in projector. Ballie can also do sweeps of your home and send you updates about what your pet\u2019s getting up to in your absence. We haven\u2019t had any hands-on time with Samsung\u2019s little helper, yet we\u2019re still itching to know just how far we can kick the thing. \u2014 Kyle Barr\nLG CineBeam Qube 4K Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube 4K Projector\nKeeping in the theme of cute tech. The LG CineBeam Qube is a projector that\u2019s as big as a toaster, weighs just over 3 pounds, and is more powerful than projectors twice its size. This 4K projector can cover 120 inches of wall space. \u2014 Jorge Jimenez\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nAsus\u2019 new Zenbook Duo is already proving to be one of those controversial pieces of tech. Some might think it looks clunky and weird, but it could prove a big boon for those who go screen akimbo at their work desk. We\u2019re hoping to get some hands-on with the laptop soon to see if it has enough power for both OLEDs at once. \u2014 Kyle Barr\nPlayStation 5 Slim Side Plates and Matching DualSense Controllers\nPlayStation 5 Slim Side Plates and Matching DualSense Controllers\nI really like the look of the new PS5 Slim that was recently released, so of course, I was pleasantly surprised to see three new side covers for the console. I\u2019m digging the Volcano Red with matching DualSense, though I hope Sony\nreleases more exciting colors in the future. \u2014 Jorge Jimenez\nFuse Audio\u2019s Vertical Record Player\nFuse Audio\u2019s Vertical Record Player\nFuse has been making vertical record players for a while now, but this new one comes with two 30-watt speakers and screams vibes. It plays 33s, 45s, and 78s and has Bluetooth 5.0 support. I want one. \u2014 Jorge Jimenez\nAlienware\u2019s 4K QD-OLED\nAlienware\u2019s 4K QD-OLED\nThis year\u2019s slate of gaming monitors all promise big resolution gains, but Alienware\u2019s 4K, 240Hz QD-OLED is one of the best we\u2019ve seen in a very crowded field. The 32-inch screen has a gentle curve that isn\u2019t overwhelming but still does enough to\ncenter your field of vision on gameplay. \u2014 Kyle Barr"

        "raw_content": "It\u2019s Taken Almost 50 Years but We\u2019re Finally Getting a Jaws Pinball Machine\nStern has announced its latest pinball machine, and collectors around the world are realizing they\u2019re going to need a bigger game room. Stern\u2019s next release looks all the way back to 1975 and turns the first modern blockbuster film into a pinball machine for the first time. Yep, get ready for Jaws pinball later this month, one year before the movie\u2019s 50th (?!?) anniversary. (Yes, there was a European pin called Jaws back in the late \u201970s, but it wasn\u2019t based on the movie.)\nBased on the trailer released today, the Jaws pinball machine definitely won\u2019t feel 50 years old. It\u2019s full of the modern tricks and gimmicks combined with classic pinball game design that define pinball in the 21st century, with an HD screen showing footage from the movie, newly recorded audio clips by Richard Dreyfuss, and audio assets from the film alongside the kind of playfield toys we\u2019ve seen in pinball since the \u201990s, the ramp-heavy playfield layouts that took over in the \u201980s, and classic shots that have been the backbone of the game since it first added flippers.\nAccording to Stern\u2019s press release, players assume the role of Quint, Robert Shaw\u2019s grizzled shark hunter, as he and Matt Hooper and Martin Brody track down the giant great white terrorizing Amity Island around the Fourth of July. (Given that pinball games are rarely \u201cbeatable\u201d in the way videogames are, it makes sense that you\u2019d play as a doomed character.) Among\u00a0 the many movie references within the game, Sterm promises a \u201cShark Fin\u201d target and \u201cblood in the water\u201d lighting effects, as well as an upper playfield based on the Orca, the boat Quint, Brody, and Hooper use to hunt the shark. Upper playfields are almost always a great addition to any pinball machine, so I, for one, am stoked to see one here. And of course you can\u2019t have a Jaws pinball machine without Jaws itself (or whatever the shark\u2019s name is); at some point a shark toy pops out of the bottom of the playfield, taking out a fishing boat, no doubt triggered by some elaborate series of shots players will have to pull off\u2014or maybe after ramming the ball straight into that boat a few times in a row. (Pinball can be elegant, but at the end of the day it\u2019s still about slamming and jamming little metal balls all over the damn place.)\nThe\u00a0Jaws\u00a0machine will be available in Stern\u2019s typical three-tiered production plan, with a Limited Edition retailing at $12,999, a Premium Edition going for $9,699, and the Pro Edition coming in at $6,999. Expect the Limited and Premium Editions to have more elaborate and complicated playfields than the cheaper Pro Edition, with the Limited Edition coming with a variety of cosmetic and performance upgrades. Just looking at the photos released by Stern, I can tell that the Pro edition doesn\u2019t have the upper playfield (boo), and that its shark toy doesn\u2019t come up from beneath a boat on the playfield, so once again the most affordable option, and the one most likely to be found at bars or arcades, is a fundamentally different and less complex game than the Premium and Limited Editions. The Limited Edition will only have a single 1000 machine run, so if you want to get in before the secondary market sends the price up, you might want to buy one straight from Stern. All three machines will debut at Stern\u2019s booth at CES in Las Vegas this month, and Pro and Limited Editions are expected to start shipping out to buyers and locations by the end of January.\nFind some photos of the machines below, as well as the official trailer showing the machines in action.\njaws\npinball\nstern\nGET PASTE RIGHT IN YOUR INBOX\nThe best music, movies, TV, books, comedy and more.\nSign\nUp\n\u00a9 2024 Paste Media Group.
