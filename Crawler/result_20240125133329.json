        "raw_content": "I really wanted to hate the $2,000 earbuds I tried at CES\nInstead, I need to hide my credit card away so Breggz won't bankrupt me\nLook, anyone who is saying they\u2019re going to start selling a pair of $2,000 studio monitor-quality in-ear headphones had better show up with the receipts. At that price point, one could acquire Apple\u2019s top-of-the-line AirPod Max headphones and have enough money left over to pick up a MacBook Pro as well.\nI spoke with Breggz Audio\u2018s CFO, Jeroen van Els, to figure out what it was about these in-ear headphones that was so special.\n\u201cOne of our founders is a performing artist in the Netherlands. He was wondering why, through his in-ear monitors, he had such great-quality music in his ears when he was onstage, but why no consumer product was reaching these levels of audio quality,\u201d van Els told TechCrunch in an interview at CES 2024. That was the beginning of the journey.\nFrom there, the company fell into a rabbit hole of creating the best possible in-ear headphones. I\u2019ll admit to listening to their spiel with no small amount of cynicism. At first, I misheard him, thinking the price tag was $750 \u2014 which is already somewhat ludicrous. But no, the CES special preorder price is $1,750, and the final MSRP will be closer to two grand.\nTrying them out\nMy disbelief held until the team offered me a demo, starting with the experience of opening up the magnetic charging case \u2014 it unfolds like a Transformer, which turns on a light on the top of the device and boots up the circuits in the headphones.\nWhile the final headphones will be custom 3D-printed to fit someone\u2019s ears, the demo set still fit me pretty well. As soon as I put them in (\u201cyou kind of put them in your ears, then \u2018screw them in\u2019 to secure them,\u201d van Els instructed me) I was in a quiet, wonderful oasis blocking out the din of the busy show floor. Then he started the demo track, and I was transported to a world I\u2019ve not experienced in quite a few years. Incredible, rich bass. Beautiful clarity. And not at particularly high volume either. It was, in a word, one of the best audio experiences I\u2019ve ever had, and I felt my heart sink. Fuck. Was I going to have to dig into my wallet and spend $2K on a pair of earphones? Surely not.\nThe Breggz headphones aren\u2019t small \u2014 but the custom, 3D-printed casings should ensure comfort and stay-put qualities. Image Credits: Breggz Audio\nAfter the (admittedly brief) demo, van Els showed me the \u201ctransparency\u201d mode, which meant he was able to talk to me while I was still wearing the earphones. I noted that there was also an active noise canceling mode, which van Els sheepishly admitted wasn\u2019t working yet, as they were still implementing it. That was the true jaw-drop moment for me: The peace I had experienced was courtesy of noise isolation, without active noise cancellation turned on.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve developed wireless in-ear monitors, essentially a full wireless in-ear computer, maintaining the quality of wired monitors. It\u2019s an \u2018in-ear computer\u2019 because it includes a speaker and a processor, enabling various functions like voice and head motion controls, and software for instant translation,\u201d van Els said. \u201cWe have our first production samples ready and plan to scale up production, aiming for a market launch in Q2 this year.\u201d\nThe tech\nThe earphones use a modular \u201ccartridge\u201d approach, which slots into the earbud. That means that if something happens to your earbuds, they can be upgraded and/or repaired without having to create a full new headphone. The company is taking a sustainable approach, meaning they are designed to last a lifetime with replaceable parts \u2014 at least as long as the company is around and willing and able to service their products, that is.\nAn exploded view of a Breggz earbud showing its modular design. Image Credits:\u00a0Breggz Audio\nThe earbuds feature four high-end balanced armature drivers per ear, produced by Knowles, for what the company refers to as a \u201cconcert-like sound.\u201d Of course, the earphones do still rely on Bluetooth technology (5.2 to be exact), which introduces enough latency that they might not be perfectly suitable in live concert settings.\n\u201cOur product has the lowest latency in the market, suitable for everyday users. For professional artists needing lower latency, we\u2019re working on solutions to be introduced later,\u201d van Els shares.\u00a0\u201cThe good news is that the latency is a software issue, so future updates could further enhance the product.\u201d\nThe company produced a video with an interview of the company\u2019s founder, which goes into some more details:\nAfter I walked away from the booth, I put in my AirPod Pros. They\u2019re my usual companions when I\u2019m out and about. I thought they were pretty decent, but compared to what I\u2019d just experienced, they were utter garbage \u2014 even with active noise canceling turned on.\nAnd, I came to realize, that is the magic of CES: Sometimes, you get to completely reset your expectations and find a new baseline as you interact with some brand new technology. Will the company be successful in bringing its products to market, and turn them into a commercial success? Who knows. But even if they don\u2019t, it has been the stand-out, jaw-on-the-floor moment for me at CES so far."

Each pair of BREGGZ is tailor-made to give customers the best possible sound for a truly wireless in-ear device experience \u2014 a dramatic change in sound and luxury. BREGGZ will showcase its technology at CES Unveiled Las Vegas on Sunday evening, January 7, 2024, and as part of the NL Tech Pavilion in Eureka Park at the Venetian Expo, Booth 62100, from January 9\u201312, 2024. The global true wireless stereo earbuds market is expected to reach nearly $244 billion by 2028; however, the market is saturated currently with devices that don\u2019t fit users\u2019 ears and sound terrible. BREGGZ offers a luxury alternative; BREGGZ are not simply another hearable, but state-of-the-art in-ear computers that are custom designed specifically to fit each individual user\u2019s ears perfectly. Individual ears are unique as a fingerprint. BREGGZ utilizes technology that allows customers to scan their individual ears and provides a better customized replica than even hand-made molds. Ear scans are modified into 3D print files, and exclusively selected BREGGZ partners produce 3D-printed medical-grade ceramic or plastic shells and faceplates. The BREGGZ hearable features an A+ audio experience with four high-end balanced armature driversper individual ear and pinna produced by industry leader Knowles, which provide a concert-like experience. BREGGZ utilizes a unique, patented \u2018one-box\u2019 technology, in which all of the hardware and firmware are processed in a mini cartridge, which can be easily replaced in the event the user wants to upgrade to a newer version of BREGGZ, or there is a battery charge decrease over time. BREGGZ can also be customized like made-to-measure jewelry. Faceplate collections are planned for offer in collaboration with other luxury brands, artists and athletes. Built with Sustainability in Mind.Headphones are often discarded after a few years of use or when a newer model is launched, creating needless recycling and waste. BREGGZ are made to last a lifetime. BREGGZ owners never need to replace their headphones; the patented cartridge that houses BREGGZ technology is smaller in diameter than the tip of an adult\u2019s pinky finger, is universally assembly-line produced, and easily changed to access new and updated features \u2014 making BREGGZ a more sustainable, eco-friendly hearable vs. the status quo.\u201cI wanted customers to hear what I hear as a professional artist,\u201d said BREGGZ co-founder and CEO Xander de Buisonj\u00e9, a noted Dutch vocalist with several number-one hits in the Benelux region who wanted to replicate the same wired In-Ear Monitors (IEMs) he\u2019s used for years while singing. \u201cBREGGZ provides a true wireless luxury alternative for customers who want the highest quality sound, fit, and comfort from in-ear monitors, but BREGGZ offers so much more than performance: each pair is customized and as much of a piece of art or a personal statement as a high-end piece of equipment. A pair of BREGGZ is a true luxury item.\u201d BREGGZ will be available worldwide, starting initially in Europe, the United States, the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, at a special CES introductory price of USD $1,750 or \u20ac1,600, and an expected ship date of Q3 2024.

Quote Xandes: \u201cI just want the world to hear what I hear!\u201d\nHowever, the wired version of the existing IEMs is no longer a fit in the current world of True Wireless devices. Only in 2021 the global hearables market made a revenue of EUR 37 billion, and is expected to grow to EUR 93 billion in 2026 (growth of 26.2% per year).\nChanging an existing wired IEM's to a fully custom-made hearable, tailored to everyone's individual ears, is a huge innovation. In close cooperation with our development team in USA, Germany, Australia and Austria, we developed the product.

BREGGZ uses a unique scanning technology in which the customer scans his own ears. The scan gives a better result than a hand-made mold. As a result, it fits perfectly on everyone's ear, it is a personal ID and gives maximum comfort when worn.\nThe scan of the ears will be modified into a 3D print file and the CERAMIC shell and faceplate can be produced by exclusively selected BREGGZ partners.\nThe patented housing of our technology, in a cartridge, smaller than the tip of your pinky finger, is universal, assembly lined produced and easy replaceable.\nBREGGZ is officially launching in January 2024 and positions itself as a luxury brand, as a fashion statement as much as your designer bag or Swiss watch at a retail price of EUR 1,500.

Tuned's\nFDA-approved AI technology is now being integrated into OTC hearing aids, offering opportunities for private branding and retail and online sales. JVC has partnered with Tuned and longtime hearing aid developer and manufacturer Intricon to introduce the JVC EHZ1500 OTC hearing aid. See it at: Venetian Expo, Halls A-D, Smart Home, Booth 53623.\nxMEMS has announced an innovative reference design for the fast-growing sleep buds product segment that will be available for demonstration at CES 2024. The Skyline DynamicVent technology, which is also being employed in some hearing aids, delivers improved comfort and automatic ambient control using a physical vent and DSP noise detection. Skyline can be closed for superior noise blocking, or opened to vent the ear and reduce occlusion effects. xMEMs will also be showcasing Cowell, reportedly the world\u2019s smallest solid-state micro speaker that delivers superior high-frequency response and clarity, plus a wider sound stage for TWS earphones and hearing aids.\u00a0Montara Plus, is said to be the world\u2019s highest output MEMS micro speaker, capable of sound pressure levels up to 120 dB at 200 Hz, making it an ideal full-bandwidth transducer for audiophile-grade in-ear monitors and high-end over-ear headphones. See it at: Venetians Suite 29-235.\nThe xMEMS Skyline DynamicVent (top) can be situated in the vent of a hearing aid or earbud to control the amount of passive (unprocessed) sound allowed into the ear. Essentially, it acts as a controllable gate: the closed position (bottom left) shuts out the ambient sound and maximizes the processed sound, improving bass tones and streamed music; the open position (bottom right) allows more ambient passthrough for better spatial awareness and reduced occlusion (own-voice) effects.\nWhat did we miss?\nYou can view all the exhibitors at the CES website.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe best audio tech at CES 2024: next-gen wireless headphones, speakers and more\nThe 23 best audio products and concepts we saw at CES 2024\nTo say that CES 2024 has delighted and surprised us is an understatement, with audio innovations, wireless wizardry and great-sounding gadgets taking their place upfront and center stage (and rightly so).\nCES 2024 proper kicked off on Tuesday, January 9 and ran until Friday, January 12, 2024 (oh, we didn't want it to end!), and over the course of the event, manufacturers from BREGGZ to Bose, EarFun to FiiO, Hidizs to Kanto, Naqi to Sonos, Sony to Victrola and myriad more showed off their latest audio tech, concept ideas, prototypes and ready-for-market products.\nThe sonic treats unveiled will soon be vying for a spot on our best headphones, best turntables, and best wireless earbuds lists, once we can get our hands on them and put them through our fully star-rated review process. That said, we've had people on the ground in Las Vegas throughout the event, so our ears-on coverage might be all that's needed for you to decide whether a product is worth snapping up now \u2013 or as soon as its hits the shelves.\nWe've rounded up the 23 most exciting audio tech announcements revealed at CES 2024 \u2013 so strap in and get comfortable, there's plenty here to enjoy.\nSpeakers, turntables, streamers and, er\u2026 cassette players\nWant to improve your home theater surround-sound system or upgrade your speakers? CES 2024 is the place to find out what's hot right now; we've been treated to a veritable smorgasbord of home audio solutions.\nFirst up is the unique LG Labs DukeBox (above), a concept translucent OLED screen-toting valve amp jukebox with fireside visuals \u2013\u00a0yes, that's really as good a summary as we can muster. Billed as \"an innovative audio product that seamlessly combines the charm of vacuum tube audio with cutting-edge transparent OLED panel technology\", we have to admire the idea: classic sensibilities mixed with state-of-the-art technology.\nElsewhere, Sonus Faber unveiled arguably the most high-ticket item at CES, the Sonus Faber Suprema speaker system, yours for a cool $750,000 (and who's to say it isn't worth every last cent?). At the other end of the food chain, JBL brought special sonic Auracast powers to its most lovable and affordable next-gen JBL Clip 5 speaker.\nOn that note, our very own Matt Bolton attended a very special Auracast demo at CES involving faux airport lounges and the like, and he truly believes the audio broadcasting tech will change our relationship with our headphones \u2013 and with each other.\nThe Focal Aria Evo X is a five-strong lineup of Focal speakers unveiled at CES \u2013 and, frankly, we think the availability of a moss green finish option alone makes it the floorstander to beat at CES.\nIf you want a speaker around which to build a multi-room wireless audio system or one to connect to a turntable, the new Audio Pro C20 could be it. I've written\u00a0love letters to this firm's stunning speaker output, and with the slightly bigger C20, the company has broadened its already extensive connectivity options.\nBy adding a phono stage, Audio Pro's new speaker can be plugged straight into your turntable, allowing you to simply power it on, lower that needle and get into the groove! Of course, this is Audio Pro (maker of some of the\u00a0best wireless speakers\u00a0on the planet), so the new C20 also features AirPlay 2,\u00a0Google\u00a0Cast, Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, Bluetooth, ARC and multi-room capability, too.\nDon't have a turntable yet? Don't you worry, we've just the thing\u2026\nIf it's a new plate-spinner you're after, Victrola's extensive CES rollout included a slew of hot decks. Our favorite? We've narrowed it down to either the Victrola Automatic, a fully automatic turntable with a first-of-its-kind \"Repeat\" feature to continuously repeat the side of a vinyl record, or the Victrola Stream Sapphire (pictured above), the company's new best-in-class flagship wireless turntable, which now works with multiple streaming ecosystems. What makes it so good? The Victrola Stream Sapphire builds on the DNA of Victrola\u2019s inaugural October 2022 Stream deck \u2013\u00a0which you can learn about in our dedicated\u00a0Victrola Stream Carbon review\u00a0\u2013 by expanding on its connectivity solutions, to stream vinyl in \"stunning clarity\" to UPnP and Roon-integrated systems as well as Sonos, plus support for up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio.\nIf that\u2019s not old-school enough, feast your eyes on this ode to the original 1979 Sony Walkman, the FiiO C13. That's right, we came to CES 2024 and saw a portable cassette player. There's no Bluetooth, so forget wireless listening (this is real retro; you've got to live it), plus the only new-fangled feature is the USB-C charging port, so you won't need to keep buying batteries. It does have a rewind button, though, so there will be no flipping the tape over and fast-forwarding to go back to the start of your jam, right before the beat drops.\nBack to the future (see what we did there) of audio and FiiO's been busy here, too \u2013check out the little bijou music maestro above, the FiiO R9. In a nutshell, it's the compact music system with smartphone-esque screen I need in my life, because it's so multi-faceted it's hard to know what to call it. DAC/amp streamer? Music hub? Entire just-add-speakers music streaming system?\u00a0It's all of these things \u2013 and, refreshingly, it takes up about the same room in you home as a houseplant.\nFiiO calls it a \"flagship desktop audio player/streamer & balanced DAC/amplifier\". We call it a fantastically featured and great-looking little proposition.\nSoundbars\nAdding a soundbar (or upgrading the one you have) can add oodles of separation, immersion and bass clout to your home entertainment setup, and CES 2024 has delivered standard \"bar-and-sub\" propositions and quirky space-saving options in equal measure.\nTake Samsung, which revealed its 2024 soundbar lineup at CES, headlined by the Samsung HW-Q990D (above), which is the successor to the fantastic\u00a0Samsung HW-Q990C \u2013 one of the\u00a0best Dolby Atmos soundbars\u00a0available. It has 11.1.4 channels (the same as the Q990C), supports wireless Dolby Atmos, and now comes with\u00a04K\u00a0120Hz passthrough for games consoles, something the Q990C lacked. There\u2019s also Party Play mode, which tunes the HW-Q990D to play a balanced sound across the whole system when listening to music, so everyone has the same experience.\nSamsung had an ace up its sleeve, though \u2013 the Music Frame. It's essentially a picture frame that's also a wireless speaker and/or subwoofer, and I think that is both a great idea and a very bad one, in equal measure.\nLook, we adore\u00a0Samsung's The Frame TV, which happily becomes an electronic art gallery\u00a0when you're not bingeing the entire series of Beef on Netflix \u2013\u00a0and as our IKEA-meets-Sonos\u00a0Symfonisk Picture Frame with Wi-Fi Speaker review\u00a0proves, we love an audio solution boasting space-saving style and substance.\u00a0Samsung tells us the Samsung HW-LS60D (aka the technical name for the Music Frame) is the world\u2019s first customizable and personalized wireless speaker with built-in IoT hub, and it's meant to \"be used as a TV speaker, rear speaker, or a subwoofer \u2013 and even pair two for more surround sound options\".\nMusic Frame also boasts Dolby Atmos support and hides two woofers, two tweeters, and two mid-drivers behind your chosen photo (you can digitally print your favorite memories onto the accompanying \"Art Panel\"; a Diasec matte acrylic plate).\nFrom an audio perspective, we must remain cautious: the Music Frame is literally meant to hang on a wall, which\u00a0should\u00a0mean vibrations, articles, echo \u2013 all of the audio nasties. Then again, we love the space-saving, art-loving concept and this is Samsung, after all, so we'll reserve judgement until we've heard it properly.\nHeadphones and earbuds\nCES 2024 has seen a swathe of fantastic wireless earbuds, so it might seem odd to be kicking off with a relatively humble-looking pair (by today's standards) from EarFun. But the EarFun Wave Pro aren't just the company's first ever stab at over-ear headphones; they're also LDAC and hi-res certified, offer noise cancellation and a whopping 80-hour battery life, all for $79.99. Suffice to say, we can't wait to hear them.\nScreens on earbuds' cases are definitely a thing at CES 2024 \u2013 Samsung unveiled a Galaxy Buds case with an OLED screen, but said it had no plans to actually release it, while JBL is sticking to its screen-enhanced earbuds lineup with the new JBL Live 3. They come in three different designs, but they all have one feature in common: JBL's touchscreen Smart Charging Case, which is designed to make it much easier and quicker to access your audio playback and your earbuds' various features \u2013 it's like having a smartwatch screen right on the case.\nWe first saw JBL's screen-enhanced case in the JBL Tour Pro 2, and were fans initially: in our\u00a0JBL Tour Pro 2 review we said that the case was \"a thing of beauty\". However, the novelty kind of wore off, over time, in favor of our trusty phone and JBL's excellent companion app.\nThere are three options in the JBL Live 3 range: Buds, Beam and Flex. As with their current incarnations, the Buds 3 look most like standard earbuds; the Beam 3 are like\u00a0Apple's AirPods Pro, sporting a stick design and an in-ear fit; the Flex 3 are like regular AirPods, with a stick design but no silicone tip that sits right in the ear canal. All three have JBL's True Adaptive Noise Cancelling and\u00a0Bluetooth 5.3 with LE Audio.\nThe next big thing in portable listening gear at CES 2024? Neural headphones. If the idea of your headphones being able to read your mind doesn't sit easy with you, calm yourself with the thought that products such as the CES Innovation Award honoree Naqi Neural Earbuds and NeurGear ZenBud are designed not to neurohack your noggin and control your actions, but to help you out \u2013\u00a0either by giving you full, hands-free control over your Windows or Mac computer, including typing, browsing, online shopping and gaming (Naqi); or by stimulating your Vagus nerve using ultrasonic sound waves to relax you (NeurGear).\nWe've been covering similar tech since June of last year, with the Neurable headphones. It seems the idea really is here to stay, and if it could potentially act as a safe and non-invasive alternative to brain implants, we're all for it.\nElsewhere, BREGGZ has unveiled a new \"hearable\": made-to-measure earbuds that both promise a custom fit better than even hand-made molds. They're are also being touted as \"the world\u2019s first truly wireless, custom-made in-ear computer\".\nIn a resoundingly positive nod to sustainability, BREGGZ's IEMs also utilize a unique, patented \"one-box\" technology, where all of the hardware and firmware is processed in a mini cartridge, which can be easily replaced if (or when) the user wants to upgrade to a newer version, or following a battery charge decrease over time.\nBut what of the heavy-hitters? Sennheiser has unveiled the new Momentum True Wireless 4 along with the Accentum Plus, and Momentum Sport for every kind of listener \u2013\u00a0but the headline grabber is the Momentum True Wireless 4 earbuds, billed as \"Sennheiser's most capable earbud yet\". They're built around the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform \u2013 which is also going to be a really big deal in 2024 \u2013 and Snapdragon Sound, which means aptX lossless sound quality, as well as exceptionally low latency. The Bluetooth version is 5.4 with confirmed support for\u00a0Auracast, improved ANC, something Sennheiser calls \"evolved tuning\", and upgraded batteries to boot.\nAlso landing were the Audio-Technica ATH-TWX7 wireless earbuds \u2013 chic, hi-res Audio-Technica earbuds with LDAC streaming for less \u2013 and, in the wired realm, the Hidizs ST2 Pro Digital IEMs, which not only boast hi-res audio support but also a DAC built into the USB-C connector.\nIt's a simple audiophile-friendly solution that means levelling up your wired audio with a separate DAC dongle to get the goods will no longer be necessary \u2013 making the ST2 Pro almost certainly a serious audio upgrade for your iPhone 15, Android phone, Mac or PC.\nHi-Fi acessories\nTechRadar's Josephine Watson (Managing Editor, Lifestyle) tried Nanoleaf's new music-syncing software at CES, and discovered that house parties will never be the same.
