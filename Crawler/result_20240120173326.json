        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Chinese tech giants Alibaba, ByteDance lead China\u2019s return to premier consumer electronics show in Las Vegas\nTikTok eyes US$17.5 billion shopping business on Amazon\u2019s turf\n\u201cYou have big exhibitors coming back, really showcasing that this is a platform that really pushes for consumers and enterprises and maybe [can] combat some of these major challenges that we\u2019re facing,\u201d Brian Comiskey, director of consumer programmes at the CTA, said after his opening remarks on Sunday afternoon.\nThis marks a stark reversal from 2023, when China had just started to reopen its borders but restrictions did not fall fast enough for many companies to make it to the show in the first week of January.\n\u201cSome of the largest Chinese companies that have signed up for participation this year \u2026 will all have a large presence at the show,\u201d John Kelley, vice-president and show director for CES at the Consumer Technology Association (CTA), told the Post in an interview on November 29. \u201cBut where we\u2019re really seeing growth on the Chinese side is smaller companies.\u201d\nKelley said the CTA was anticipating numbers to reach pre-Covid levels, and it looks like the show has pulled it off. The number of Chinese companies is more than the 1,000 that state-run tabloid Global Times reported for the 2020 show. CTA said the show has attracted around 4,000 exhibitors, although numbers are not final yet. Kelley said CES expects to see 130,000 attendees.\nAlibaba was highlighted as one of the exhibitors using machine learning platforms to \u201cpower e-commerce\u201d.\nEven much smaller companies are touting their use of AI. Govee, a smart lighting maker from Shenzhen, is advertising the use of generative AI to help people create specific moods, like asking for a backdrop that is evocative of the Hong Kong skyline or Barbie Dreamhouse.\nXpeng is among the major electric vehicle makers at the show, where it will be demonstrating its new \u201cflying car\u201d, the AeroHT.\nTikTok and its Beijing-based owner ByteDance have been under intense political scrutiny in Washington over data privacy and national security concerns. This may not have deterred TikTok from showing up to the largest consumer electronics shows in its largest market.\nNumber of Chinese tech firms at CES 2023 less than half of pre-pandemic level\nRepresentatives from the company will join two panels at the show to discuss sports and entertainment. Beyond entertainment, though, ByteDance makes much of its money through advertising and has been trying to grow its e-commerce business.\nOther Chinese companies cannot exhibit at the show even if they want to because they have been listed on Washington\u2019s Entity List. This includes the world\u2019s largest drone maker DJI and a number of semiconductor companies.\n\u201cFrom a show management perspective, we welcome participation from every company,\u201d CTA\u2019s Kelley said. \u201cAs a US-based trade association, we cannot allow participation if they are on some sort of Entity List. That\u2019s really the only place where we will not allow participation.\u201d\nStill, CES may be more important for the many small firms that make up the bulk of the show\u2019s exhibition floor. It remains the premier event of its kind.\n\u201cWe like to make the case that the four days you spend in Las Vegas is some of the most efficient use of your time in the sense that you don\u2019t have to necessarily travel the world to meet with individual business partners on six different continents,\u201d said Kelley. \u201cInstead, you can come to Las Vegas and meet everybody that you need to meet from the global technology industry over the course of a week.\u201d"
