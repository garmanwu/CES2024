The number of Chinese companies is more than the 1,000 that state-run tabloid Global Times reported for the 2020 show. CTA said the show has attracted around 4,000 exhibitors, although numbers are not final yet. Kelley said CES expects to see 130,000 attendees.\nAlibaba was highlighted as one of the exhibitors using machine learning platforms to \u201cpower e-commerce\u201d.\nEven much smaller companies are touting their use of AI. Govee, a smart lighting maker from Shenzhen, is advertising the use of generative AI to help people create specific moods, like asking for a backdrop that is evocative of the Hong Kong skyline or Barbie Dreamhouse.\nXpeng is among the major electric vehicle makers at the show, where it will be demonstrating its new \u201cflying car\u201d, the AeroHT.\nTikTok and its Beijing-based owner ByteDance have been under intense political scrutiny in Washington over data privacy and national security concerns. This may not have deterred TikTok from showing up to the largest consumer electronics shows in its largest market.\nNumber of Chinese tech firms at CES 2023 less than half of pre-pandemic level\nRepresentatives from the company will join two panels at the show to discuss sports and entertainment. Beyond entertainment, though, ByteDance makes much of its money through advertising and has been trying to grow its e-commerce business.\nOther Chinese companies cannot exhibit at the show even if they want to because they have been listed on Washington\u2019s Entity List. This includes the world\u2019s largest drone maker DJI and a number of semiconductor companies.\n\u201cFrom a show management perspective, we welcome participation from every company,\u201d CTA\u2019s Kelley said. \u201cAs a US-based trade association, we cannot allow participation if they are on some sort of Entity List. That\u2019s really the only place where we will not allow participation.\u201d\nStill, CES may be more important for the many small firms that make up the bulk of the show\u2019s exhibition floor. It remains the premier event of its kind.\n\u201cWe like to make the case that the four days you spend in Las Vegas is some of the most efficient use of your time in the sense that you don\u2019t have to necessarily travel the world to meet with individual business partners on six different continents,\u201d said Kelley. \u201cInstead, you can come to Las Vegas and meet everybody that you need to meet from the global technology industry over the course of a week.\u201d"

The first edition will take place from 16 \u2013 18 September 2021 at the Shenzhen World Exhibition & Convention Center, occupying over 100,000 sqm of exhibition space.\nShare\nAll signs are pointing towards e-commerce as the major trend in global trade. As a leader in the e-commerce industry, China accounts for 45%[1] of the world's total transaction volume. In recent years, the industry has experienced a sharp rise, particularly during the pandemic, with online retail sales increasing by 9.7%[2] year-on-year in 2020. To help the industries seize the enormous opportunities in this field, Messe Frankfurt (Shenzhen) Co Ltd, China Merchants Exhibition Management (Shenzhen) Co Ltd and Beijing Talent-Expo Co Ltd have joined forces to organise the debut edition of the China (Shenzhen) Cross Border E-commerce Fair.\nAs a comprehensive e-commerce business platform dedicated to cross border trade, the show covers the entire industry chain from product selection to platform providers and other supporting services. In alignment with the Chinese Government\u2019s \u201cdual circulation\u201d development plan in which domestic consumption and international trade mutually reinforce each other, the growth of the cross border e-commerce market is expected to accelerate. The new trend encourages the export of Chinese products overseas while attracting foreign companies to the Chinese market. Focusing on the opportunities in this perspective, Mr Stephan Buurma, Member of the Board of Management of Messe Frankfurt Group, explained the mutual benefits of the new cooperation: \u201cWith our global trade fair network, China Merchants Exhibition Management\u2019s extensive operational experiences in Shenzhen, and Beijing Talent-Expo Co Ltd\u2019s abundant domestic industry resources, CBEC will gather renowned international brands across different industries, as well as high-quality Chinese suppliers. Through the participation of a large contingent of leading local and overseas e-commerce platforms and service providers, the fair will not only promote foreign trade for Chinese suppliers, but will also draw international brands to the Chinese market.\u201d\nLast year, China\u2019s cross border e-commerce management platform reflected the strong growth of international e-commerce trade with record highs of 2.45 billion custom declarations, a year-on-year increase of 63.3%[3]. As a leading hub for the e-commerce industry, Shenzhen in the Greater Bay Area holds strategic advantages relating to product supply and support services.\nCommenting on the new partnership, Mr Ma Jun, General Manager of China Merchants Exhibition Management (Shenzhen) Co Ltd, the exhibition sector of the state-owned enterprise China Merchants Shekou Holdings, said: \u201cWe will leverage our local expertise and highlight Shenzhen\u2019s dynamic resources in the market to co-organise the first edition of CEBC with Messe Frankfurt and Beijing Talent-Expo Co Ltd. Together, this comprehensive platform will further develop cross border collaboration in the e-commerce industry. We look forward to hosting thousands of exhibitors and professional buyers at the Shenzhen World Exhibition & Convention Center, where participants can enjoy state-of-the-art facilities and a complete range of supporting services. \u201d\nThe pandemic has fuelled rapid growth in international e-commerce. Mr Lai Yi, General Manager of Beijing Talent-Expo Co Ltd explained: \u201cUnder the influence of the pandemic, global supply chains were heavily disrupted. As a result, traditional import and export trade gradually moved into e-commerce in an attempt to solve conventional trade issues such as complicated logistics procedures, low shipment volumes and inadequate product variety. Through the new collaboration, we hope to build an effective platform for small and medium sized export companies to conduct business and exchange industry knowledge. The platform will also promote digitalisation in the traditional foreign trade industry. We believe the shift towards digitalisation will stimulate global trade to become more efficient and convenient, and consequently drive the global economic recovery.\u201d\nStrategically held in September, a peak season for sourcing and a busy procurement month for regional festivals, CBEC will cover three main product categories: consumer goods suppliers, cross-border service providers and products, e-commerce platforms and media. The inaugural edition is expected to welcome 3,000 exhibitors to present their latest products and services across 100,000 sqm of exhibition space. With Messe Frankfurt's substantial resources and network of global buyers, the show will attract the full spectrum of trade visitors. This includes foreign trade e-commerce platforms, brand owners, buyers and distributors from the China Cross Border E-Commerce Comprehensive Pilot Zone (designated pilot cities for international e-commerce set up by the Chinese government), traditional B2B import and export traders, domestic agents of overseas buyers, physical retail store owners, supply chain service providers and industry associations. To add extra value to the show, various fringe programme events such as the China (Shenzhen) Cross Border E-commerce Fair Industry Summit, the IEBE Online Retailing New Growth Problem Solving Conference and the IEBE Cross-border E-commerce New Growth Problem Solving Conference will be featured, providing an ideal platform for participants to exchange ideas and keep pace with the latest industry trends.\nThe organisers will closely monitor the pandemic and strictly follow the local government\u2019s protection guidelines. Some of the key measures to be implemented include visitor authentication with real identity registration and temperature scans. Sanitisation of public areas and distancing measures will also be carried out at the fairground.\nThe China (Shenzhen) Cross Border E-commerce Fair is co-organised by Messe Frankfurt (Shenzhen) Co Ltd, China Merchants Exhibition Management (Shenzhen) Co Ltd and Beijing Talent-Expo Co Ltd.

The new arrangement will cater more effectively to consumers during important Chinese and international sourcing seasons each year. Taking place from 24 \u2013 26 March 2022, the CCBEC Spring edition is the first of the two events to be held next year, and will take place at the Shenzhen World Exhibition & Convention Center, gathering a collective of quality Chinese suppliers and internationally renowned e-commerce platforms.\nShare\nCommenting on the change, Ms Wendy Wen, Senior General Manager at Messe Frankfurt (HK) Ltd, says: \u201cShenzhen is the hub for the cross-border e-commerce industry, while it also enjoys strategic location advantages and substantial industry resources. Perfectly situated in Shenzhen, CCBEC attracts a diverse range of quality suppliers, leading e-commerce platforms and service providers. To help industry players align with various holiday and industry sourcing seasons around the world, we will organise spring and autumn editions starting from 2022. This step will also allow participants to keep up with new products and industry developments on a seasonal basis.\"\nLaunched successfully in 2021, the inaugural edition of CCBEC received huge support and compliments from industry partners, exhibitors and visitors, confirming the enormous potential of China's cross-border e-commerce industry as well as the show\u2019s effectiveness. Building on this success, CCBEC Spring will open its doors again in 2022, occupying 70,000 sqm of exhibition space and welcoming 1,200 exhibitors from the entire industry chain, including manufacturers and suppliers, cross-border service providers and products, as well as e-commerce platforms and media. \u00a0To allow participants to capitalise on the peak Chinese retail season in the first half of the year, CCBEC Spring has been moved to the end of March instead of April.\nBenefit from favourable policies\nE-commerce is a new growth driver for trade around the world and China is no exception. In the first half of 2021, China's cross-border e-commerce import and export volume reached USD 140 billion, a year-on-year increase of 28.6%.[1] All signs are pointing to cross-border e-commerce as a new driving force for overseas trade, and an important channel for business transformation.\n[1] The State Council of the People\u2019s Republic of China:\u00a0http://www.gov.cn/xinwen/2021-10/15/content_5642711.htm, published 15 October 2021\nThe tremendous prospects for the industry have been noted by the Chinese government. To promote e-commerce development, a strategic framework has been established as part of China\u2019s 14th Five-Year Plan. It will strengthen the global e-commerce ecosystem and seek international collaboration on the digital economy to support a higher level of opening up to the international market. Commenting on the positive policy, Mr Ma Jun, General Manager of China Merchants Exhibition Management (Shenzhen) Co Ltd says: \u201cIt is great news for the entire cross-border e-commerce industry. With the support from the government, the entire industry and its infrastructure will continue to develop, as more funds and talent are attracted.\u201d\n\u201cFor us, as organisers of one of the largest cross-border e-commerce trade fairs in China, we will work in alignment with the policy and support the implementation of the 14th Five-Year Plan by providing a comprehensive platform for both local and overseas suppliers, service providers, e-commerce platforms, e-tailers and international brands. The spring edition will also invite experts to share their valuable experience and industry knowledge at our educational fringe programme,\" he adds.\nIn addition to the 14th Five-Year Plan, China's State Council has released guidelines on accelerating foreign trade, including boosting cross-border e-commerce supporting policies, fostering cross-border e-commerce pilot zones, supporting overseas warehouse companies and enhancing the industry\u2019s global network. \u00a0By 2025, this improved network is predicted to bolster China\u2019s international influence, with the country introducing new regulations to govern trade.\nIn the face of these positive initiatives, CCBEC is poised to help industry players stay ahead of the market, as well as to support traditional overseas trading companies to digitalise. Alongside the show, a series of educational events will be organised covering five major topics: industry development, policy and regulations, marketing strategies, supporting services, investment and financing. Common pain points and industry problems will also be addressed and effective solutions will be offered.\nThe show will attract professional buyers to conduct sourcing and keep updated with product trends, including cross-border e-commerce platform procurement agents and sellers, cross-border e-commerce comprehensive pilot zone traders and service providers, brand owners, agents and distributors, traditional B2B import and export traders, local agents of overseas buyers, physical store retailers, supply chain service providers and industry associations.\nThe China (Shenzhen) Cross Border E-commerce Fair is co-organised by the China Chamber of International Commerce, China Merchants Exhibition Management (Shenzhen) Co Ltd, Messe Frankfurt (Shenzhen) Co Ltd, Beijing Talent International Exhibition Co Ltd and Shenzhen OCT Greater Bay Development Co Ltd.
