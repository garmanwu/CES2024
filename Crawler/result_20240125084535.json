At the beginning of last November, around 100 participants discussed at the Titanic Chaussee Hotel (TITANIC Hotels Berlin) about chances and approaches to still reach these important targets.\nOn the other hand, the good news is, that the necessary #technologies and #tools for a successful #mobilitytransition are in place with battery-electric and hydrogen-based applications. Now, it requires a reliable regulatory framework to enable the move towards emission-free mobility with planning reliability.\nVisit our latest press release at https://lnkd.in/eRKxVRyP to find out more on the findings of our conference and learn more about the event, the speakers and the key conclusions!\n#feelevolution #fev #defossilization #greenmobility #futuremobility #parisclimateagreement #goals #hydrogen #batteries\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n45,010 followers\nOur colleagues from FEV Consulting have gained exciting insights on the 800V technology in #electromobility\n#emobility #800V #feelevolution #\n8,170 followers\n\u00f0\ufffd\u0178\u00b4\u00f0\ufffd\u0178\u00ac\u00f0\ufffd\u0178\u00ac\u00f0\ufffd\u2014\u00a9 \u00f0\ufffd\u2014\u00b6\u00f0\ufffd\u02dc\u20ac \u00f0\ufffd\u2014\u00af\u00f0\ufffd\u2014\u00b2\u00f0\ufffd\u02dc\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u02dc\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2014\u00b2\u00f0\ufffd\u2014\u00bf \u00f0\ufffd\u02dc\ufffd\u00f0\ufffd\u2014\u00b5\u00f0\ufffd\u2014\u00ae\u00f0\ufffd\u2014\u00bb \u00f0\ufffd\u0178\u00b0\u00f0\ufffd\u0178\u00ac\u00f0\ufffd\u0178\u00ac\u00f0\ufffd\u2014\u00a9!\nReally?\nA balance between cost and performance is crucial for the development of profitable and #sustainable systems for #electricvehicles and other #mobility solutions.\nSwitching from 400 V to 800 V can reduce the cost of traction inverters.

The Technical Specialist for AI/ML & Connectivity is simultaneously working on her doctoral thesis in the field of #computationalengineering.\n\u00c2\nAdmittedly, she has not yet achieved her original childhood ambition of flying through the world on a #hoverboard like Marty McFly in \"Back to the Future\". Nevertheless, Michael J. Fox's role in the movie aroused young Burcu's curiosity at an early age in her desire to understand the world around her technologically.\nAfter completing her #Bachelor's degree in Physics Engineering and a Master's degree in Computational Engineering, Burcu has developed into a Technical Specialist in the field of #digitalmobility and is working on her doctorate at the same time. Thanks to her deep technical expertise, Burcu represents FEV T\u00c3\u00bcrkiye in the SELFY PROJECT, where her team is researching together with 15 partners from all over Europe, Asia and Australia to improve the security of future digital mobility ecosystems.\n\u00c2\nFor girls and women who are still unsure whether they want to pursue #STEM, Burcu has a clear recommendation: \"Feel free to follow your passion. Go beyond the boundaries that are supposedly set by your environment.\"\n\u00c2\n#FeelEVolution #FEV #Womeninmotion #Womeninengineering\u00c2\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n45,010 followers\nHow can the #profitability of #batterypowered #electromobility be increased?

But with the right #pricing, you have an even greater potential!\nAnd what role does #sustainability play?\nChoosing the right cell is one of the most important factors for cost efficiency. In addition, there are many other technical solutions with different influences on the functional criteria, but also on costs, recyclability and the CO2 footprint.\nWith the appropriate #valueengineering effort, it is always possible to leverage potential.\nBut what about the right pricing?\nWhat are your customers willing to pay for certain driving range and charging speed specifications?\nOr for sustainable production?\nContact Benjamin Knobloch, Hagen Wegner and Kevin Poch with your questions on strategic costing, pricing, #circulareconomy & benchmark examples.\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n45,010 followers\nAt #COP28 in #Dubai , around 70,000 people currently discuss how the 1.5 degree target can still be achieved. The focus is on the global stocktake, a review of the current situation with regard to achieving the 2015 #Paris #climatetargets.\nThe long-haul transport sector is accountable for around 6% of total CO\u00e2\u201a\u201a emissions in the EU; with regard to the transport sector, this segment even contributes 25%.\nIn a response to those #challenges, FEV is collaborating with 36 other partners from 13 countries in the #EU-funded ESCALATE - Horizon Europe Project to develop #highlyefficient #electricpowertrains for #heavyduty applications. These are intended to be up to 10% more efficient than current designs and achieve #ranges of up to 800 km without the need of recharging. For the six-month trial operation, regular distances of at least 500 km are initially targeted.\nOur colleague Dr. Thorsten Schnorbus had the pleasure to present this exciting project today in the Turkish pavilion at COP28.\nFor further information on #ESCALATE please visit the website https://lnkd.in/dbJ7JiUx\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n45,010 followers\nExplore topics\nSign in to view more content\nCreate your free account or sign in to continue your search\nWelcome back\nor\nBy clicking Continue, you agree to LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.\nNew to LinkedIn?
