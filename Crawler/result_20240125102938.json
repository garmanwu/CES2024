They can be found in ABS brake control systems, automatic clutches, electric window mechanism, windshield wiper motors, directional lighting controls, seat movement motors, automatic parking devices, seat belt detection, generators, interior space closures.\nWith the rapid development of science and technology, magnets are more and more widely used in communication consumer electronic products represented by mobile phones. The magnets used in receivers and speakers in mobile phones are becoming more and more refined. There are monomers and matching miniature magnets. Shaped sheet magnets. Magnets in other consumer electronic products are also ubiquitous...such as earphones, sensors, camera motors, tablet computers, etc. Jinconn can provide designed and customized magnets to meet the different needs of customers.\nNdFeB magnets can be used for industrial automation products. Industrial magnets are mainly components composed of magnets and metals, plastics and other materials. The main applications are various motors, stators, rotors, generators, engines, couplings, elevators, separators, filters, tools, electric vehicles, etc... Due to its own characteristics and performance, NdFeB magnets are mainly used in motors and generators.\nMagnets are also used in many electronic appliances and smart homes. Most kitchen appliances contain DC motors including small electric toothbrushes. Most smart appliances require small DC motors to operate, which in turn require small NdFeB magnets.

Jonway Group manufactures automobiles, motorcycles, vehicle and motor parts, light building materials, air-compressors, plastics as well as other vehicle subcomponents. Zhejiang Jonway Automobile Co., Ltd began manufacturing in May, 2003. Located at the beautiful East China sea coast-port industry zone of Jiangtiao, Sanmen county. It has invested more than 600 million RMB in producing the three- and five-door SUVs, with a capacity to produce up to 30,000 units per year.

Jonway offers a network of more than 500 auto dealerships in China alone and has started a distribution network in Italy.\nTomologicSwedenPrivateArtificial Intelligence is about to revolutionize the sheet metal industry. Tomologic joined the fourth industrial revolution by introducing Optimization Intelligence as a Service. You can now significantly reduce costs and increase processing throughput while preserving high product quality. Our optimization service can reduce manufacturers' material waste by up to 50%. Manufacturers achieve more efficient raw material utilization, lower power consumption as well as faster production processing. The bottom line: reduced material, production and operation costs.\nEzytubeAustralian/aInnovative concrete forming technology developed by a Sydney company is revolutionising the Australian construction industry, and word is fast spreading offshore. Ezytube\u2019s spiral tube technology is the world\u2019s first truly waterproof paper-based construction tube. It is manufactured using existing spiral winding equipment without any extra set-up costs, and produces a tube which is significantly lighter and offers improved strength properties. Ezytube\u2019s Managing Director Kevin Adams says the technology offers enormous advantages over alternative products currently used in the construction industry. \u201cEzytube is a lightweight, semi-rigid tube, comprising multiple layers of extremely strong plastic reinforcing mesh,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is faster, easier, safer, and offers significant cost reductions? a team of two can put up 30 columns a day whether the columns are round, square or rectangular.\u201d;Mr Adams said existing round formwork tubing traditionally used in Australian construction markets consisted of thick, heavy cardboard tubes that could not tolerate any exposure to rain without collapsing. Tubes were also made of heavy steel and plastic spirals, which were difficult to cut and remove after pouring. The sharp edges exposed by the cuts could also put workers at serious risk of injury. \u201cExisting square and rectangular shaped columns are formed by skilled carpenters cutting form ply and reinforcing with timber beams,\u201d he said. \u201cThese processes are labour intensive, slow to perform and require highly-skilled workers.\u201d;He said the Ezytube technology addresses all of these problems. It offers significant occupational health and safety benefits, it fast tracks projects, and it offers significant reductions in both labour costs and skills requirements. In the case of traditional timber forming methods, using the Ezytube can bring staggering productivity gains of between 600 and 900 per cent. \u201cAny company located in any country around the world which currently manufactures cardboard tubes for column forming purposes, using spiral paper tube winding equipment, can instantly start manufacturing our tubes upon licensing our technology and purchasing our Australian-made raw materials,\u201d said Mr Adams.\nWASPItalyPrivateWASP's ultimate goal is developing huge scale 3D printers to produce low-cost housing units. Operating as a non-profit, WASP develops and sells various sizes of delta 3D printers to finance the greater vision, which has proven itself several times and is currently in use in Italy.\nCathRx LimitedAustraliaListedCathRx is using a novel method of assembly to produce a full range of cardiac electrophysiology and ablation catheters, and has an innovative range of devices for treating atrial fibrillation in advanced development. The new assembly method achieves unlimited electrode configurations. By separating the outer, patient-contacting electrode sheath component (which is made disposable) from the expensive inner deflection component (which is made reusable), it also introduces significant cost efficiencies to clinical procedures. Current cardiac electrophysiology and ablation catheters have at least four machined platinum ring electrodes. To achieve electrical connection, metal wires must be manually passed up the lumen of a plastic tube, through a hole in the tube and welded or crimped to the electrode. The inner deflection component is fixed inside the lumen of the tube with the conductive wires. The patented CathRx assembly method utilises a cable with all the necessary wires already coiled in its wall thickness. A laser machine is used to expose the metal of each insulated wire at strategic locations, without disturbing the adjacent wires. A novel metal coating process (electroless plating) deposits all the electrodes simultaneously. This approach enables;more automated, reproducible assembly \u2013 significantly reducing manufacturing times and costs;the production of more complex catheters than can be assembled with current techniques \u2013 eg a patented multielectrode sensing and ablation catheter for treating atrial fibrillation, designed to achieve substantially higher success rates and lower procedure times;the reuse of non-patient contacting, high-cost components \u2013 which will introduce significant cost efficiencies to health care systems. These patented technologies were developed in-house by CathRx Pty Limited, which owns all IP. Clinical trials of the initial CathRx catheter designs are beginning in early 2005. The global market for electrophysiology and ablation catheters was valued at AU$400 million in 2001. Growth to AU$1 billion is expected over the next few years as catheters for treating atrial fibrillation are released. The key markets are the USA (50%) and EU (35%). Further medical applications (eg neurological) are also planned. The metal coating technology has also been applied to prototypes for aerospace conductors and fuel cells.\nRentricityUSAPrivateRentricity is a renewable energy company that generates electricity from untapped pressure in drinking water pipes.
