        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Let me start off by wishing you all a happy and healthy new year. As Glenn said, I'm out with our team at CES, and the show kicked off yesterday. It's early, but the response to our new lineup and the various projects that we have in development has been very positive.\nAnd I'm expecting more of the same over the next few days. 2023 has been tough for everyone, not to just VOXX. Our entire industry has had a very challenging year, and we're certainly happy to be turning the page. The global economy remains challenging, and we're doing all that we can to navigate through those challenges, focusing on three primary areas: protecting and growing sales in both the short and long term; improving gross margins through supply chain and internal efficiencies; and lowering both our fixed and variable expenses.\nDuring the quarter, we were successful achieving two of these three objectives as our gross margins grew by 90 basis points and our operating expenses improved by a little over 2%. Sales declined roughly 5.4%, with consumer up and automotive down. But overall, operating income was the same as the prior year. Mike will provide more financial details during his remarks, and I'll focus on the segments, what's happening, and what we expect to close out the year and as we move into fiscal 2025.\nSo, let me start with consumer as we have a lot of news to report. Consumer sales came -- were up over 6% in Q3, with Premium Audio as the driver. This is a big positive for us as the segment has been on the decline since the big bump that we had from COVID. We made a lot of changes in investments, and they're starting to pay off as evidenced by the growth this quarter, amid very challenging global economic environments.\nWithin Premium Audio, we saw good growth in North America market in Q3, driven by home speakers, wireless speaker systems, and our new lines of party speaker systems. Europe was up as well, but our APAC sales declined as the market continues to be hard-pressed. Overall, our Premium Audio business had a strong quarter, with a number of new products on the horizon in new and rapidly growing categories. Looking at the recent NPD report for November, industrywide speaker sales were down approximately 17%, but we were only down 9%.\nAVR sales were down 15% and we were down 14%. The takeaway is somewhat positive. While our Premium Audio sales are down year to date, we are growing our market share, especially domestically. And the new products and the new categories that we introduced here at the show and those that will launch in the early part of next year should help drive future growth into fiscal '25.\nHere, at CES, we had a complete lineup on display under all of our audio brands. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have developed a completely new sound bar offering and had a number of new products on display, some of which have launched with others to be launched early this year. Our big announcement was the all new Klipsch Plexus sound system powered by Onkyo. This is the first product that combines the strength of Klipsch's acoustics with Onkyo's technology.\nIt officially comes to market this year, and we have high hopes for this product as do our customers. I also talked on prior calls about our new party speakers, our Gig series, which was introduced in September, in time for the holiday season. And it has done very well and has helped offset weakness in other areas. Party speakers are one of the hottest categories in the industry.\nIt is competitive, but the market is open. We have great products slated for launch in the coming months. Here, at CES, we unveiled our new Klipsch Gig series. One product, the Gig Max, is the first party speaker that will be introduced with Klipsch's legendary horn-loaded technology that we have been perfecting since 1946.\nThese are powerful portable speakers, top-of-the-line products that deliver Klipsch's heritage sound. Another highlight was the launch of our Klipsch Music City portable Bluetooth speakers. We unveiled three new models, the Klipsch Austin, the Klipsch Nashville, and the Klipsch Detroit, with the Detroit being the premium model and the biggest in our Music City series. And these speakers along, with other compatible Klipsch models, feature the innovative Klipsch broadcast mode, which allows you to connect up to 100 speakers at once to create a fully immersive listening experience wirelessly through Bluetooth.\nWe have a strong Premium Audio lineup in 2024 and moving into 2025. And also, some big news on Monday with respect to Klipsch and the Panasonic Automotive collaboration that we've had for a number of years. Panasonic Automotive Systems Company of America and Infiniti jointly announced on Monday the partnership between our companies. The all-new and flagship 2025 Infiniti QX80 will feature the premium Klipsch Reference Premiere audio system powered by Panasonic.\nThe car with our speaker system is being featured here at CES in Panasonic's booth, and the vehicle is set to debut later this spring. It has 24 specifically designed speakers, titanium tweeters, a high-performance subwoofer, roof-mounted speakers, and Panasonic's proprietary DJX 3D surround sound processing. This adds to our program that we announced last year on the Dodge EV Ram truck. As for other CE products, sales were essentially flat with last year.\nWe saw a growth in sales of our recently launched RCA hearing aids products, with some other puts and takes between the categories. Year to date, other CE sales are up approximately 21%. And while we expect some softness near term due to the overall environment, we have strong share and a diverse customer base, and we expect to see growth in some of the newer categories to help combat this. The big launch at CES for our accessory group was the new hearing aids under RCA.\nWe launched four new products to expand our presence in this category. We also unveiled a new wireless HDMI signal sensors under the Terk brand, which connects devices to TVs and enables streaming content without cables. As well, we had additional other products under our RCA, Terk, and AR brands. Moving on to automotive, we had some challenges in Q3 as our OEM business was almost cut in half as we and our customers felt the impact of the UAW strike.\nAs always, we base plans on our customer forecast, which obviously were not met when production lines were either impacted or completely shut down. With the strike now behind us, we expect to see the automotive business begin to normalize. With the contracts that we have been awarded, we should be in a position of growth. However, with the general economy slowing based on the Fed's moves to date and car prices at all-time highs, we anticipate some near-term softness.\nDuring the quarter, automotive sales were down 26% with the miss in OEM as I just mentioned. And primarily, in rear seat entertainment, which are the biggest programs, you know, for our OEM business. Business with Ford and Stellantis were both down due to the UAW strike, with Nissan sales also down. VSM sales were up slightly, given the volume of programs in the heavy-duty truck market and the new lighting programs previously awarded.\nWe have a lot of OEM business in front of us. But with all of the supply chain and production issues over the past year or two, it has been challenging, and we are mitigating higher costs and improving our margins where we can. Our aftermarket business was down approximately 3.5 million. The general economy and the slowdown due to lower inventories and new car dealers impacted sales across most categories, with some up and others down.\nBut for the year, the automotive segment sales are off about 12.5%, and Q4 is going to be tough based on the current conditions, though, again, some loosening on the OEM side with the strike behind us. And as we move into fiscal '25 and in the years that follow, we have significant opportunities for value creation through the programs that we've been awarded and the ones that we're working on, which will give us new business opportunities to build our future pipeline. As for biometrics, sales came in less than anticipated, mostly due to a lull in implementation. All of the projects that I had mentioned previously are still in motion.\nNothing has changed. But during the quarter, we experienced very little progression in terms of rollouts. It was more testing, discussions, and planning. We should see sequential improvements in Q4.\nAnd assuming all moves as planned, some nice growth in 2025. My comments from Q2 remain. Projects with governments, financial service companies, healthcare companies, car dealerships, and more continue. And we hope to have more to report in the coming quarters as these programs build.\nTo sum it up, our sales were down in Q3, but operating income remained flat with the improvements we made to our business, resulting in better gross margins and lower expenses. As we look into Q4 in the first half of calendar '24, we believe it's going to be tight. Look at what's happening now, interest rates almost all-time highs. And that impacts not only consumers but our customers as well.\nCredit card debt is very high. Government subsidies from the pandemic are over. After a decent holiday season, amid all of these challenges, we feel the economy is slowing. And therefore, we expect the next few months may be soft, and we're going to continue to be diligent in managing our costs.\nHowever, these are the same conditions that also get the Fed to start cutting rates and stimulating the economy, and that will be good for consumers and for VOXX. The new launch of products, especially within the consumer segment, should help offset some of the economic softness. And the steps to reduce overhead that have taken place should materialize further in the fourth quarter and throughout next year. Margins should also increase, given the new products and programs underway and those launching this year.\nWe are in constant communication with our customers, we are managing our inventory tightly, and we're looking at all aspects of our business to get back to profitability. With that, I'd like to thank you. And then, I'll turn the call over to Mike. And then, we'll open it up for questions.\nMichael?\nMike Stoehr -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I'll primarily cover our nine-month results and balance sheet. But first, a few comments with respect to the third quarter. As Pat mentioned, net sales were down 5.4%, gross margins grew by 90 basis points, and operating expenses declined 2.1%.\nThis resulted in operating income for both fiscal '24 and fiscal 2023 third quarters of 2.3 million. Net income attributable to VOXX was 1.9 million, which declined by approximately 5.5 million. This was principally due to a 4 million income tax benefit recorded in the prior fiscal year period compared to an expense of 100,000. The additional variance was in other income and expense.\nWe reported total other expense of 1.4 million versus total other income of 36,000 in the comparable prior period. Additionally, EBITDA was 6.5 million compared to 7.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA was 8 million compared to 9 million. As for the nine-month comparisons, all numbers are for the periods ended November 30th, 2023 and November 30th, 2022. We reported nine-month sales of 360.8 million, a decline of 36.7 million or 9.2%.\nWithin this, automotive segment sales were down 15.6 million, with OEM product sales down 4.6 million and aftermarket product sales down 11.1 million. Consumer segment sales were down 19.7 million with Premium Audio product sales down 31.9 million and other CE product sales up by 12.2 million. Biometric sales declined by approximately 300,000. Sales are down for the year, and we'll continue to see some pressure in Q4, consistent with Pat's remarks.\nOur automotive business was impacted by the strike and customer production lines, and we're hoping we'll see some more normalization in the coming quarters. Retail is tight, but we're starting to turn the corner with new products in Premium Audio and accessory products. Those other CE products have held up well this year with solar-powered balcony products, wireless speakers, and hearing aids helping to offset economic and consumer softness. We continue to take steps to improve our gross margins, which were up 170 basis points sequentially and up 50 basis points year to date.\nFor the nine-month period comparisons, gross margins came in at 25.6% as compared to 25.1%, with automotive segment margins down 20 basis points and consumer segment margins up 70 basis points. Over time, we expect automotive margins to improve with the relocation of manufacturing to Mexico, price increases, and other steps we've taken to enhance our supply chain and lower costs. However, we need production to catch up. Consumer segment margins continue to improve sequentially.\nAnd again, new products should help continue to drive improvements if we maintain volume and, of course, depending on product mix and customer programs. Total operating expenses for the nine-month comparisons were 110.2 million as compared to $114 million, an improvement of 3.8 million or 3.3%. Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, total operating expenses improved by 5.3 million or 4.7%. We're continuing to look at all aspects of our operations to remove nonessential costs and are looking to lower our overhead further in light of the ongoing economic softness.\nWe're tightly managing expenses, inventory, and our cash. Selling expenses declined 3.4 million, an improvement of 9.6% versus the prior year, G&A expenses declined 1.3 million, an improvement of 2.4%, and engineering and technical support expenses declined by approximately 600,000, an improvement of 2.5%. We had restructuring costs of approximately 2.2 million related to our restructuring and manufacturing relocation programs in fiscal 2024 year to date. This compares approximately -- this compares to approximately 500,000 of structuring costs and 100,000 of acquisition costs in fiscal 2023, nine-month period.\nWe reported an operating loss of 17.7 million compared to an operating loss of 14.3 million, principally due to lower sales volume. Net loss attributable to VOXX was 19.9 million compared to a net loss of 9.3 million. EBITDA for the fiscal 2024 nine-month period was a loss of 6.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA was 3 million. This compares to an EBITDA loss in comparable fiscal 2023 nine-month period of 3.2 million and an adjusted EBITDA of 5.6.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of November 30th, we had cash and cash equivalents of 10.4 million, which compares to 6.1 million as of our fiscal 2023 year-end on February 28th. Cash and cash equivalents stood at 5.9 million at the end of our fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended August 31st. Our accounts receivable will increase by 8.9 million as we were in the higher volume holiday season.\nOur inventory declined by 28.9 million for the nine months as we were moving through all the product lines. We still have inventory on hand to move through, and we're focused on that, given the launches underway and upcoming, especially in our consumer segment. As I noted during our last quarterly call, we expect inventories to continue to decline as we move through the fourth and first quarters. Total debt stood at 48.6 million as compared to 39.2 million as of February 28th.\nThe increase of 9.4 million relates to 10 million increase in our borrowings associated with our domestic credit line, partially offset by a 400,000 decline to our Florida mortgage and a 200,000 decline in the amount owed on the shareholder loan payable to Sharp as part of our joint venture. Total long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, was 47.1 million as compared to 37.5 million as of February 28th. As noted, the increase in total debt relates to the increase in our borrowings. This is typical during the third quarter as our sales and receivables increase than normally collected during the fourth quarter.\nThis will be the case. During the fourth quarter, we'll be using our credit facility to support the final arbitration settlement, which was announced earlier this month. As reported, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with Seaguard with an effective date of today, January 10th. We have agreed to pay Seaguard 42 million in total, of which a payment of 10 million was already made on December 27th, and the final payment of 32 million will be made today.\nWhile we're not happy with the ruling, we feel it is our best interest, as well as our shareholders to move forward and focus on our business and stop accruing interest in legal fees which continue to mount. With the banking relationships in place and the cash availability we have, the payment will be made. And we have sufficient working capital to fund our business moving forward. Of course, we're hopeful that market conditions improved sooner rather than later, and we can get back to cash flow generation and profitability.\nOperator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.\nPat Lavelle -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Mike.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] And there appear to be no questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Pat Lavelle.\nPat Lavelle -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOK, thank you. I want to thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. I look forward to 2024 with enthusiasm as new product has always been the lifeline and the key to our growth. And we have a lot of new products scheduled for next year.\nSo, with that, thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nGlenn Wiener -- Investor Relations\nPat Lavelle -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nMike Stoehr -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nMore VOXX analysis\nAll earnings call transcripts\nThis article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.

Let me start off by wishing you all a happy and healthy new year. As Glenn said, I'm out with our team at CES, and the show kicked off yesterday. It's early, but the response to our new lineup and the various projects that we have in development has been very positive.\nAnd I'm expecting more of the same over the next few days. 2023 has been tough for everyone, not to just VOXX. Our entire industry has had a very challenging year, and we're certainly happy to be turning the page. The global economy remains challenging, and we're doing all that we can to navigate through those challenges, focusing on three primary areas: protecting and growing sales in both the short and long term; improving gross margins through supply chain and internal efficiencies; and lowering both our fixed and variable expenses.\nDuring the quarter, we were successful achieving two of these three objectives as our gross margins grew by 90 basis points and our operating expenses improved by a little over 2%. Sales declined roughly 5.4%, with consumer up and automotive down. But overall, operating income was the same as the prior year. Mike will provide more financial details during his remarks, and I'll focus on the segments, what's happening, and what we expect to close out the year and as we move into fiscal 2025.\nSo, let me start with consumer as we have a lot of news to report. Consumer sales came -- were up over 6% in Q3, with Premium Audio as the driver. This is a big positive for us as the segment has been on the decline since the big bump that we had from COVID. We made a lot of changes in investments, and they're starting to pay off as evidenced by the growth this quarter, amid very challenging global economic environments.\nWithin Premium Audio, we saw good growth in North America market in Q3, driven by home speakers, wireless speaker systems, and our new lines of party speaker systems. Europe was up as well, but our APAC sales declined as the market continues to be hard-pressed. Overall, our Premium Audio business had a strong quarter, with a number of new products on the horizon in new and rapidly growing categories. Looking at the recent NPD report for November, industrywide speaker sales were down approximately 17%, but we were only down 9%.\nAVR sales were down 15% and we were down 14%. The takeaway is somewhat positive. While our Premium Audio sales are down year to date, we are growing our market share, especially domestically. And the new products and the new categories that we introduced here at the show and those that will launch in the early part of next year should help drive future growth into fiscal '25.\nHere, at CES, we had a complete lineup on display under all of our audio brands. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have developed a completely new sound bar offering and had a number of new products on display, some of which have launched with others to be launched early this year. Our big announcement was the all new Klipsch Plexus sound system powered by Onkyo. This is the first product that combines the strength of Klipsch's acoustics with Onkyo's technology.\nIt officially comes to market this year, and we have high hopes for this product as do our customers. I also talked on prior calls about our new party speakers, our Gig series, which was introduced in September, in time for the holiday season. And it has done very well and has helped offset weakness in other areas. Party speakers are one of the hottest categories in the industry.\nIt is competitive, but the market is open. We have great products slated for launch in the coming months. Here, at CES, we unveiled our new Klipsch Gig series. One product, the Gig Max, is the first party speaker that will be introduced with Klipsch's legendary horn-loaded technology that we have been perfecting since 1946.\nThese are powerful portable speakers, top-of-the-line products that deliver Klipsch's heritage sound. Another highlight was the launch of our Klipsch Music City portable Bluetooth speakers. We unveiled three new models, the Klipsch Austin, the Klipsch Nashville, and the Klipsch Detroit, with the Detroit being the premium model and the biggest in our Music City series. And these speakers along, with other compatible Klipsch models, feature the innovative Klipsch broadcast mode, which allows you to connect up to 100 speakers at once to create a fully immersive listening experience wirelessly through Bluetooth.\nWe have a strong Premium Audio lineup in 2024 and moving into 2025. And also, some big news on Monday with respect to Klipsch and the Panasonic Automotive collaboration that we've had for a number of years. Panasonic Automotive Systems Company of America and Infiniti jointly announced on Monday the partnership between our companies. The all-new and flagship 2025 Infiniti QX80 will feature the premium Klipsch Reference Premiere audio system powered by Panasonic.\nThe car with our speaker system is being featured here at CES in Panasonic's booth, and the vehicle is set to debut later this spring. It has 24 specifically designed speakers, titanium tweeters, a high-performance subwoofer, roof-mounted speakers, and Panasonic's proprietary DJX 3D surround sound processing. This adds to our program that we announced last year on the Dodge EV Ram truck. As for other CE products, sales were essentially flat with last year.\nWe saw a growth in sales of our recently launched RCA hearing aids products, with some other puts and takes between the categories. Year to date, other CE sales are up approximately 21%. And while we expect some softness near term due to the overall environment, we have strong share and a diverse customer base, and we expect to see growth in some of the newer categories to help combat this. The big launch at CES for our accessory group was the new hearing aids under RCA.\nWe launched four new products to expand our presence in this category. We also unveiled a new wireless HDMI signal sensors under the Terk brand, which connects devices to TVs and enables streaming content without cables. As well, we had additional other products under our RCA, Terk, and AR brands. Moving on to automotive, we had some challenges in Q3 as our OEM business was almost cut in half as we and our customers felt the impact of the UAW strike.\nAs always, we base plans on our customer forecast, which obviously were not met when production lines were either impacted or completely shut down. With the strike now behind us, we expect to see the automotive business begin to normalize. With the contracts that we have been awarded, we should be in a position of growth. However, with the general economy slowing based on the Fed's moves to date and car prices at all-time highs, we anticipate some near-term softness.\nDuring the quarter, automotive sales were down 26% with the miss in OEM as I just mentioned. And primarily, in rear seat entertainment, which are the biggest programs, you know, for our OEM business. Business with Ford and Stellantis were both down due to the UAW strike, with Nissan sales also down. VSM sales were up slightly, given the volume of programs in the heavy-duty truck market and the new lighting programs previously awarded.\nWe have a lot of OEM business in front of us. But with all of the supply chain and production issues over the past year or two, it has been challenging, and we are mitigating higher costs and improving our margins where we can. Our aftermarket business was down approximately 3.5 million. The general economy and the slowdown due to lower inventories and new car dealers impacted sales across most categories, with some up and others down.\nBut for the year, the automotive segment sales are off about 12.5%, and Q4 is going to be tough based on the current conditions, though, again, some loosening on the OEM side with the strike behind us. And as we move into fiscal '25 and in the years that follow, we have significant opportunities for value creation through the programs that we've been awarded and the ones that we're working on, which will give us new business opportunities to build our future pipeline. As for biometrics, sales came in less than anticipated, mostly due to a lull in implementation. All of the projects that I had mentioned previously are still in motion.\nNothing has changed. But during the quarter, we experienced very little progression in terms of rollouts. It was more testing, discussions, and planning. We should see sequential improvements in Q4.\nAnd assuming all moves as planned, some nice growth in 2025. My comments from Q2 remain. Projects with governments, financial service companies, healthcare companies, car dealerships, and more continue. And we hope to have more to report in the coming quarters as these programs build.\nTo sum it up, our sales were down in Q3, but operating income remained flat with the improvements we made to our business, resulting in better gross margins and lower expenses. As we look into Q4 in the first half of calendar '24, we believe it's going to be tight. Look at what's happening now, interest rates almost all-time highs. And that impacts not only consumers but our customers as well.\nCredit card debt is very high. Government subsidies from the pandemic are over. After a decent holiday season, amid all of these challenges, we feel the economy is slowing. And therefore, we expect the next few months may be soft, and we're going to continue to be diligent in managing our costs.\nHowever, these are the same conditions that also get the Fed to start cutting rates and stimulating the economy, and that will be good for consumers and for VOXX. The new launch of products, especially within the consumer segment, should help offset some of the economic softness. And the steps to reduce overhead that have taken place should materialize further in the fourth quarter and throughout next year. Margins should also increase, given the new products and programs underway and those launching this year.\nWe are in constant communication with our customers, we are managing our inventory tightly, and we're looking at all aspects of our business to get back to profitability. With that, I'd like to thank you. And then, I'll turn the call over to Mike. And then, we'll open it up for questions.\nMichael?\nMike Stoehr -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nThanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I'll primarily cover our nine-month results and balance sheet. But first, a few comments with respect to the third quarter. As Pat mentioned, net sales were down 5.4%, gross margins grew by 90 basis points, and operating expenses declined 2.1%.\nThis resulted in operating income for both fiscal '24 and fiscal 2023 third quarters of 2.3 million. Net income attributable to VOXX was 1.9 million, which declined by approximately 5.5 million. This was principally due to a 4 million income tax benefit recorded in the prior fiscal year period compared to an expense of 100,000. The additional variance was in other income and expense.\nWe reported total other expense of 1.4 million versus total other income of 36,000 in the comparable prior period. Additionally, EBITDA was 6.5 million compared to 7.7 million, and adjusted EBITDA was 8 million compared to 9 million. As for the nine-month comparisons, all numbers are for the periods ended November 30th, 2023 and November 30th, 2022. We reported nine-month sales of 360.8 million, a decline of 36.7 million or 9.2%.\nWithin this, automotive segment sales were down 15.6 million, with OEM product sales down 4.6 million and aftermarket product sales down 11.1 million. Consumer segment sales were down 19.7 million with Premium Audio product sales down 31.9 million and other CE product sales up by 12.2 million. Biometric sales declined by approximately 300,000. Sales are down for the year, and we'll continue to see some pressure in Q4, consistent with Pat's remarks.\nOur automotive business was impacted by the strike and customer production lines, and we're hoping we'll see some more normalization in the coming quarters. Retail is tight, but we're starting to turn the corner with new products in Premium Audio and accessory products. Those other CE products have held up well this year with solar-powered balcony products, wireless speakers, and hearing aids helping to offset economic and consumer softness. We continue to take steps to improve our gross margins, which were up 170 basis points sequentially and up 50 basis points year to date.\nFor the nine-month period comparisons, gross margins came in at 25.6% as compared to 25.1%, with automotive segment margins down 20 basis points and consumer segment margins up 70 basis points. Over time, we expect automotive margins to improve with the relocation of manufacturing to Mexico, price increases, and other steps we've taken to enhance our supply chain and lower costs. However, we need production to catch up. Consumer segment margins continue to improve sequentially.\nAnd again, new products should help continue to drive improvements if we maintain volume and, of course, depending on product mix and customer programs. Total operating expenses for the nine-month comparisons were 110.2 million as compared to $114 million, an improvement of 3.8 million or 3.3%. Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, total operating expenses improved by 5.3 million or 4.7%. We're continuing to look at all aspects of our operations to remove nonessential costs and are looking to lower our overhead further in light of the ongoing economic softness.\nWe're tightly managing expenses, inventory, and our cash. Selling expenses declined 3.4 million, an improvement of 9.6% versus the prior year, G&A expenses declined 1.3 million, an improvement of 2.4%, and engineering and technical support expenses declined by approximately 600,000, an improvement of 2.5%. We had restructuring costs of approximately 2.2 million related to our restructuring and manufacturing relocation programs in fiscal 2024 year to date. This compares approximately -- this compares to approximately 500,000 of structuring costs and 100,000 of acquisition costs in fiscal 2023, nine-month period.\nWe reported an operating loss of 17.7 million compared to an operating loss of 14.3 million, principally due to lower sales volume. Net loss attributable to VOXX was 19.9 million compared to a net loss of 9.3 million. EBITDA for the fiscal 2024 nine-month period was a loss of 6.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA was 3 million. This compares to an EBITDA loss in comparable fiscal 2023 nine-month period of 3.2 million and an adjusted EBITDA of 5.6.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of November 30th, we had cash and cash equivalents of 10.4 million, which compares to 6.1 million as of our fiscal 2023 year-end on February 28th. Cash and cash equivalents stood at 5.9 million at the end of our fiscal 2024 second quarter, ended August 31st. Our accounts receivable will increase by 8.9 million as we were in the higher volume holiday season.\nOur inventory declined by 28.9 million for the nine months as we were moving through all the product lines. We still have inventory on hand to move through, and we're focused on that, given the launches underway and upcoming, especially in our consumer segment. As I noted during our last quarterly call, we expect inventories to continue to decline as we move through the fourth and first quarters. Total debt stood at 48.6 million as compared to 39.2 million as of February 28th.\nThe increase of 9.4 million relates to 10 million increase in our borrowings associated with our domestic credit line, partially offset by a 400,000 decline to our Florida mortgage and a 200,000 decline in the amount owed on the shareholder loan payable to Sharp as part of our joint venture. Total long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs, was 47.1 million as compared to 37.5 million as of February 28th. As noted, the increase in total debt relates to the increase in our borrowings. This is typical during the third quarter as our sales and receivables increase than normally collected during the fourth quarter.\nThis will be the case. During the fourth quarter, we'll be using our credit facility to support the final arbitration settlement, which was announced earlier this month. As reported, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with Seaguard with an effective date of today, January 10th. We have agreed to pay Seaguard 42 million in total, of which a payment of 10 million was already made on December 27th, and the final payment of 32 million will be made today.\nWhile we're not happy with the ruling, we feel it is our best interest, as well as our shareholders to move forward and focus on our business and stop accruing interest in legal fees which continue to mount. With the banking relationships in place and the cash availability we have, the payment will be made. And we have sufficient working capital to fund our business moving forward. Of course, we're hopeful that market conditions improved sooner rather than later, and we can get back to cash flow generation and profitability.\nOperator, we are now ready to open the call for questions.\nPat Lavelle -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nThank you, Mike.\nQuestions & Answers:\nOperator\n[Operator instructions] And there appear to be no questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Pat Lavelle.\nPat Lavelle -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nOK, thank you. I want to thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. I look forward to 2024 with enthusiasm as new product has always been the lifeline and the key to our growth. And we have a lot of new products scheduled for next year.\nSo, with that, thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator\n[Operator signoff]\nDuration: 0 minutes\nCall participants:\nGlenn Wiener -- Investor Relations\nPat Lavelle -- President and Chief Executive Officer\nMike Stoehr -- Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer\nMore VOXX analysis\nAll earnings call transcripts\nThis article is a transcript of this conference call produced for The Motley Fool.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to VOXX International Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded.\nI\u2019ll now hand the conference over to your speaker host, Mr. Glenn Wiener. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Wiener\nThank you, Olivia. Good morning, and welcome to VOXX International's fiscal 2024 third quarter and nine month results conference call. Yesterday, we filed our Form 10-Q, and we issued our press and both documents can be found in the Investor Relations section of the website at www.voxxintl.com, and we expect to post an updated investor presentation later this week.\nSpeaking from management today will be Pat Lavelle, Chief Executive Officer, who is currently out in Las Vegas, attending the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show; and Michael Stoehr, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Their remarks will be followed by question and answers.\nAs for today, I would like to remind everyone that except for historical information contained herein, statements made on today's call and webcast that would constitute forward-looking statements are based on currently available information. The company assumes no responsibility to update any such forward-looking statements and I'd like you to point you to the risk factors associated with our business which are detailed in our Form 10-K for the period ended February 28, 2023.\nThank you for your continued support, and I would like to now turn the call over to Pat.\nPatrick Lavelle\nThank you, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Let me start off by wishing you all a happy and healthy New Year. As Glenn said, announced with our team at CES and show kicked off yesterday. It's early, but the response to our new lineup and the various projects that we have in development has been very positive, and I'm expecting more of the same over the next few days. 2023 has been tough for everyone, not just as VOXX, our entire industry has had a very challenging year, and we're certainly happy to be turning the page.\nThe global economy remains challenging, and we're doing all that we can to navigate through those challenges, focusing on three primary areas: protecting and growing sales in both the short and long-term, improving gross margins through supply chain and internal efficiencies, and lowering both our fixed and variable expenses.\nDuring the quarter, we were successful achieving two of these three objectives, as our gross margins grew by 90 basis points, and our operating expenses improved by a little over 2%. Sales declined roughly 5.4% with Consumer up and Automotive down. But overall, operating income was the same as the prior year. Mike will provide more financial details during his remarks, and I'll focus on the segments, what's happening and what we expect to close out the year, and as we move into fiscal 2025.\nSo let me start with Consumer, as we have a lot of new -- news to report. Consumer sales came -- were up over 6% in Q3, with Premium Audio the driver. This is a big positive for us as the segment has been on the decline since the big bump that we had from COVID. We made a lot of changes and investments and they're starting to pay-off, as evidenced by the growth this quarter amidst very challenging global economic environments.\nWithin Premium Audio, we saw a good growth in North America market in Q3, driven by home speakers, wireless speaker systems and our new lines of party speaker systems. Europe was up as well, but our APAC sales declined as the market continues to be hard pressed. Overall, our Premium Audio business had a strong quarter with a number of new products on the horizon in new and rapidly growing categories.\nLooking at the recent NPD report for November, industry-wide speaker sales were down approximately 17%, but we were only down 9%. AVR sales were down 15%, and we were down 14%. The takeaway is somewhat positive, while our Premium Audio sales are down year-to-date. We are growing our market share, especially domestically and the new products and the new categories that we introduced here at the show and those that will launch in the early part of next year should help drive future growth into fiscal '25.\nHere at CES, we had a complete lineup on display under all of our audio brands. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have developed a completely new sound bar offering and had a number of new products on display, some of which have launched with others to be launched early this year. Our big announcement was the all-new Klipsch Flexus sound system powered by Onkyo. This is the first product that combines the strength of Klipsch\u2019s Acoustics with Onkyo's electronic technology. It officially comes to the market this year, and we have high hopes for this product, as do our customers.\nI also talked on prior calls about our new party speakers, our Gig series, which was introduced in September and time for the holiday season, and it has done very well and has help to offset weakness in other areas. Party speakers are one of the hottest categories in the industry. It is competitive, but the market is open. We have great products slated for launch in the coming months.\nHere at CES, we unveiled our new Klipsch Gig series, one product, the Gig Max, is the first-party speaker that will be introduced with Klipsch\u2019s legendary, horn-loaded technology that we've been perfecting since 1946. These are powerful, portable speakers, top of the line products that deliver Klipsch\u2019s heritage sound.\nAnother highlight was the launch of our new Klipsch Music City portable Bluetooth speakers. We unveiled three new models, the Klipsch Austin, the Klipsch Nashville and the Klipsch Detroit, with the Detroit being the premier model and the biggest in our Music City series. These speakers, along with other compatible Klipsch models, feature the innovative Klipsch broadcast mode, which allows you to connect up to a 100 speakers at once to create a fully immersive listening experience wirelessly through Bluetooth. We have strong Premium Audio lineup in 2024 and moving into 2025.\nAnd also some big news on Monday with respect to Klipsch, and the Panasonic Automotive collaboration that we've had for a number of years. Panasonic Automotive Systems Company of America and Infinity jointly announced on Monday, the partnership between our companies. The all-new and flagship 2025 INFINITI QX80 will feature the premium Klipsch reference premier audio system powered by Panasonic.\nThe car with our speaker system is being featured here at CES in Panasonic\u2019s booth and the vehicle is set to debut later this spring. It has 24 specifically designed speakers titanium treaters, a high-performance sub-woofer, roof-mounted speakers and Panasonic\u2019s proprietary DJX 3D surround sound processing. This adds to our program that we announced last year on the Dodge EV RAM truck.\nAs for other CE products, sales were essentially flat with last year. We saw growth in sales of our recently launched RCA hearing aid products with some other puts and takes between the categories. Year-to-date, other CE sales are up approximately 21%. And while we expect some softness near-term due to the overall environment, we have strong share in a diverse customer base, and we expect to see growth in some of the newer categories to help combat this.\nThe big launch at CES for our accessory group with the new hearing aids under RCA, we launched four new products to expand our presence in this category. We also unveiled a new wireless HDMI Signal centers under the Turk brand, which connects devices to TVs and enables streaming content without cables. As well, we had additional other products under our RCA, Turk and AR brands.\nMoving on to Automotive. We had some challenges in Q3 as our OEM business was almost cut in half as we and our customers felt the impact of the UAW strike. As always, we base plans on our customer forecast, which obviously were not met when production lines were either impacted or completely shut down.\nWith the strike now behind us, we expect to see the Automotive business begin to normalize. With the contracts that we have been awarded, we should be in a position of growth. However, with the general economy slowing based on the Fed's moves to date and car prices at all-time highs, we anticipate some near-term softness.\nDuring the quarter, Automotive sales were down 26%, with the miss in OEM, as I just mentioned, and primarily in rear-seat entertainment, which are the biggest programs for our OEM business. Business with Ford and Stellantis were both down due to the UAW strike with Nissan sales also down.\nVSM sales were up slightly given the volume of programs in the heavy-duty truck market and the new lighting programs previously awarded. We have a lot of OEM business in front of us, but with all of the supply chain and production issues over the past year or two, it has been challenging, and we are mitigating higher costs and improving our margins where we can.\nOur aftermarket business was down approximately $3.5 million, the general economy and slow down due to lower inventories on new car dealers, impacted sales across most categories, with some up and others down.\nFor the year, the Automotives segment sales are off about 12.5%, and Q4 is going to be tough based on the current conditions, though, again, some loosening on the OEM side with the strike behind us. And as we move into fiscal '25 and in the years that follow, we have significant opportunities for value creation through the programs that we've been awarded and the ones that we're working on, which will give us new business opportunities to build our future pipeline.\nAs for biometrics, sales came in less than anticipated, mostly due to the low in implementation. All of the projects that I had mentioned previously are still in motion. Nothing has changed, but during the quarter, we experienced very little progression in terms of rollouts. It was more testing, discussions and planning.\nWe should see sequential improvements in Q4 and assuming all moves as planned, some nice growth in 2025. My comments from Q2 remain, projects with governments, financial service companies, health care companies, car dealerships and more continue and we hope to have more to report in the coming quarters as these programs build.\nTo sum it up, our sales were down in Q3, but operating income remained flat with the improvements we made to our business, resulting in better gross margins and lower expenses. As we look into Q4 in the first half of calendar '24, we believe it's going to be tight. Look at what's happening now. Interest rates almost all-time highs, and that impacts not only consumers, but our customers as well.\nCredit card debt is very high. Government subsidies from the pandemic are over. After a decent holiday season amidst all of these challenges, we feel the economy is slowing. And therefore, we expect the next few months may be soft, and we're going to continue to be diligent in managing our costs. However, these are the same conditions and also get the Fed to start cutting rates and stimulating the economy, and that will be good for consumers and for VOXX.\nThe new launch of products, especially within the Consumer segment should help offset some of the economic softness and the steps to reduce overhead that have taken place should materialize further in the fourth quarter and throughout next year. Margin should also increase given the new products and programs underway in those launching this year. We are in constant communication with our customers. We're managing our inventory tightly, and we're looking at all aspects of our business to get back to profitability.\nWith that, I'd like to thank you. And then, I'll turn the call over to Mike, and then we'll open it up for questions. Michael?\nMichael Stoehr\nThanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I'll primarily cover our nine-month results and balance sheet, but first, a few comments with respect to the third quarter. As Pat mentioned, net sales were down 5.4%, gross margins grew by 90 basis points and operating expenses declined 2.1%. This resulted in operating income for both fiscal '24 and fiscal 2023 third quarters of $2.3 million.\nNet income attributable to VOXX was $1.9 million, which declined by approximately $5.5 million. This is principally due to a $4 million income tax benefit recorded in the prior fiscal year period compared to an expense of $100,000. The additional variance was in other income and expense. We reported total other expense of $1.4 million versus total other income of $36,000 in the comparable period -- prior period.\nAdditionally, EBITDA was $6.5 million compared to $7.7 million and adjusted EBITDA was $8 million compared to $9 million. As for the nine-month comparisons, all numbers are for the period ended November 30, 2023 and November 30, 2022. We reported nine-month sales of $360.8 million, a decline of $36.7 million or 9.2%.\nWithin this, Automotive segment sales were down $15.6 million, with OEM product sales down $4.6 million and aftermarket product sales down $11.1 million. Consumer segment sales were down $19.7 million, with Premium Audio product sales down $31.9 million and other CE product sales up by $12.2 million. Biometrics sales declined by approximately $300,000.\nSales are down for the year, and we'll continue to see some pressure in Q4 consistent with Pat's remarks. Our Automotive business was impacted by the strike and customer production lines and we're hoping we'll see some more normalization in the coming quarters.\nRetail is tight, but we're starting to turn the corner with new products in Premium Audio and our accessory products. Those other CE products have held up well this year with solar power balcony products, wireless speakers and hearing aids, helping to offset economic and consumer softness.\nWe continue to take steps to improve our gross margins, which were up 170 basis points sequentially and up 50 basis points year-to-date. For the nine-month period comparisons, gross margins came in at 24.6% as compared to 25.1% with Automotive segment margins down 20 basis points and Consumer segment margins up 70 basis points.\nOver time, we expect Automotive margins to improve with the relocation of manufacturing to Mexico, price increases and other steps we've taken to enhance our supply chain and lower costs. However, we need production to catch up. Consumer segment margins continue to improve sequentially. And again, new products should help continue to drive improvements if we maintain volume and, of course, depending on product mix and customer programs.\nTotal operating expenses. For the nine month comparison were $110.2 million as compared to $114 million, an improvement of $3.8 million or 3.3%. Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, total operating expenses improved by $5.3 million or 4.7%. We're continuing to look at all aspects of our operations to remove non-essential costs and are looking to lower our overhead further in light of the ongoing economic softness. We're tightly managing expenses, inventory and our cash.\nSelling expenses declined $3.4 million, an improvement of 9.6% versus the prior year. G&A expenses declined $1.3 million, an improvement of 2.4%, and engineering and technical support expenses declined by approximately $600,000, an improvement of 2.5%. We had restructuring costs of approximately $2.2 million, related to our restructuring and manufacturing relocation programs in fiscal 2024 year-to-date.\nThis compares to approximately $500,000 of restructuring costs and $100,000 of acquisition costs in fiscal 2023 nine month period. We reported an operating loss of $17.7 million compared to an operating loss of $14.3 million, principally due to lower sales volume. Net loss attributable to VOXX was $19.9 million compared to a net loss of $9.3 million.\nEBITDA for fiscal 2024 nine month period was a loss of $6.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $3 million. This compares to an EBITDA loss in comparable fiscal 2023 nine month period of $3.2 million and an adjusted EBITDA of 5.6%.\nMoving on to the balance sheet. As of November 30, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.4 million, which compares to $6.1 million as of our fiscal 2023 year-end on February 28. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $5.9 million at the end of our fiscal 2024 second quarter ended August 31. Our accounts receivable increased by $8.9 million as we're in the higher volume holiday season.\nOur inventory declined by $28.9 million for the nine months as we are moving through all the product lines. We still have inventory on hand to move through, and we're focused on that given the launches underway and upcoming, especially in our Consumer segment. As I noted during our last quarterly call, we expect inventories to continue to decline as we move through the fourth and first quarters.\nTotal debt stood at $48.6 million as compared to $39.2 million as of February 28. The increase of $9.4 million relates to $10 million increase in our borrowings associated with our domestic credit line, partially offset by a $400,000 decline to Florida mortgage and a $200,000 decline in the amount owed on the shareholder loan, payable to Sharp as part of our joint venture.\nTotal long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs was $47.1 million as it compared to $37.5 million as of February 28. As noted, the increase in total debt relates to the increase in our borrowings. This is typical during the third quarter as our sales and receivables increased -- than normally collected during the fourth quarter. This will be the case. During the fourth quarter, we'll be using our credit facility to support the final arbitration settlement, which was announced earlier this month.\nAs reported, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with Seaguard with an effective date of today, January 10. We have agreed to pay Seaguard $42 million in total, of which a payment of $10 million was already on December 27 and the final payment of $32 million will be made today. While we're not happy with the rules (ph), we feel it is our best interest as well as our shareholders to move forward and focus on our business and stop accruing interest and legal fees, which continue to mount.\nWith the banking relationships in place, and the cash availability we have, the payment will be made, and we have sufficient working capital to fund our business moving forward. Of course, we're hopeful that market conditions improve sooner rather than later, and we can get back to cash flow generation and profitability.\nOperator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.\nGlenn Wiener\nThank you, Mike.\nQuestion-and-Answer Session\n[Operator Instructions] And there appear to be no questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Pat Lavelle.\nPatrick Lavelle\nOkay. Thank you. I want to thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. I look forward to 2024 with enthusiasm as new product has always been the lifeline and the key to our growth, and we have a lot of new products scheduled for next year. So with that, thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, that\u2019s all for our conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nAbout VOXX Stock\nMore on VOXX\nTrending Analysis\nTrending News"

It's early, but the response to our new lineup and the various projects that we have in development has been very positive, and I'm expecting more of the same over the next few days. 2023 has been tough for everyone, not just as VOXX. Our entire industry has had a very challenging year. And we're certainly happy to be turning the page. The global economy remains challenging, and we're doing all that we can to navigate through those challenges, focusing three primary areas: protecting and growing sales in both the short and long term, improving gross margins through supply chain and internal efficiencies, and lowering both our fixed and variable expenses. During the quarter, we were successful achieving two of these three objectives as our gross margins grew by 90 basis points, and our operating expenses improved by a little over 2%. Sales declined roughly 5.4% with Consumer up and Automotive down. But overall, operating income was the same as the prior year. Mike will provide more financial details during his remarks, and I'll focus on the segments, what's happening and what we expect to close out the year and as we move into fiscal 2025. So let me start with Consumer as we have a lot of new news to report. Consumer sales came -- were up over 6% in Q3, with Premium Audio the driver. This is a big positive for us as the segment has been on the decline since the big bump that we had from [COVID].We made a lot of changes and investments and they're starting to pay off as evidenced by the growth this quarter amidst very challenging global economic environments. Within Premium Audio, we saw good growth in North America market in Q3, driven by home speakers, wireless speaker systems and our new lines of party speaker systems. Europe was up as well, but our APAC sales declined as the market continues to be hard pressed. Overall, our Premium Audio business had a strong quarter with a number of new products on the horizon in new and rapidly growing categories. Looking at the recent NPD report for November, industry-wide speaker sales were down approximately 17%, but we were only down 9%. [AVR] sales were down 15%, and we were down 14%. The takeaway is somewhat positive, while our Premium Audio sales are down year-to-date. We are growing our market share, especially domestically and the new products and the new categories that we introduced here at the show and those that will launch in the early part of next year should help drive future growth into fiscal '25. Here at CES, we had a complete lineup on display under all of our audio brands. And as I mentioned last quarter, we have developed a completely new sound bar offering and had a number of new products on display, some of which have launched with others to be launched early this year. Our big announcement was the all-new Klipsch Flexus Sound System powered by Onkyo. This is the first product that combines the Klipsch's Acoustics with Onkyo's electronic technology. It officially comes to market this year, and we have high hopes for this product, as do our customers. I also talked on prior calls about our new party speakers, our Gig series, which was introduced in September in time for the holiday season, and it has done growth and has helped offset weakness in other areas. Party speakers are one of the hottest categories in the industry. It is competitive, but the market is open. We have great products slated for launch in the coming months. Here at CES, we unveiled our new Klipsch GiG series, one product with the GiG [Max], is the first-party speaker that will be introduced with Klipsch legendary, horn-loaded technology that we've been perfecting since 1946. These are powerful, portable speakers, top-of-the-line products that deliver Klipsch's heritage sound. Another highlight was the launch of our new Klipsch Music City portable Bluetooth speakers. We unveiled three new models, the Klipsch Austin, the Klipsch Nashville and the Klipsch Detroit, with the Detroit being the premier model and the biggest in our Music City series. In this series, along with other compatible Klipsch models, feature the innovative Klipsch broadcast mode, which allows you to connect up to 100 speakers at once to create a fully immersive listening experience wirelessly through Bluetooth. We have strong Premium Audio lineup in 2024 and moving into 2025. And also some big news on Monday with respect to Klipsch, and the Panasonic Automotive collaboration that we've had for a number of years. Panasonic Automotive Systems Company of America and INFINITI jointly announced on Monday, the partnership between our companies. The all-new and flagship 2025 INFINITI QX80 will feature the premium Klipsch reference premier audio system powered by Panasonic. The car with our speaker system is being featured here at CES in Panasonic booth and the vehicle is set to debut later this spring. It has 24 specifically designed titanium tweeters, a high-performance subwoofer, roof-mounted speakers and Panasonic proprietary DJX 3D surround sound processing. This adds to our program that we announced last year on the Dodge EV RAM truck. As for other CE products, sales were essentially flat with last year. We saw growth in sales of our recently launched RCA hearing aid products with some other puts and taste between the categories. Year-to-date, other CE sales are up approximately 21%. And while you expect some softness near term due to the overall environment, we have strong share in a diverse customer base, and we expect to see growth in some of the newer categories to help combat this. A big launch at CES for our accessory group with the new hearing aids under RCA. We launched four new products to expand our presence in this category. We also unveiled a new wireless HDMI Signal centers under the Turk brand, which connects devices to TVs and enables streaming content without cables. As well, we had additional other products under our RCA, Turk and AR brands. Moving on to Automotive. We had some challenges in Q3 as our OEM business was almost cut in half as we and our customers felt the impact of the UAW strike. As always, we base plans on our customer forecast, which obviously were not met when production lines were either impacted or completely shut down. With the strike now behind us, we expect to see the Automotive business begin to normalize. With the contracts that we have been awarded, we should be in a position of growth. However, with the general economy slowing based on the Fed's moves to date and car prices at all-time highs, we anticipate some near-term softness. During the quarter, Automotive sales were down 26%, with the miss in OEM, as I just mentioned. And primarily in rear-seat infotainment, which are the biggest -- for our OEM business. Business with Ford and Stellantis were both down due to UAW strike with Nissan sales also down. VSM sales were up slightly given the volume of programs in the heavy-duty truck market and the new lighting programs previously awarded. We have a lot of OEM business in front of us, but with all of the supply chain and production issues over the past year or two, it has been challenging, and we are mitigating higher costs and improving our margins where we can. Our aftermarket business was down approximately $3.5 million, general economy and slow down due to lower inventories at new car dealers, impacted sales across most categories, with some up and others down. For the year, the Automotive segment sales are off about 12.5%, and Q4 is going to be up based on the current conditions, though, again, some loosening on the OEM side with the strike behind us. And as we move into fiscal '25 and in the years that follow, we have significant opportunities for value creation through the programs that we've been awarded and the ones that we're on, which will give us new business opportunities to build our future pipeline. As for biometrics, sales came in less than anticipated, mostly due to the low in implementation. All of the projects that I had mentioned previously are still in motion. Nothing has changed. But during the quarter, we experienced very little progression in terms of rollouts. It was more testing, discussions and planning. We should see sequential improvements in Q4 and assuming all those as planned, some nice growth in 2025. My comments from Q2 remain: projects with governments, financial service companies, health care companies, car dealerships and more continue and we hope to have more to report in the coming quarters as these programs build. To sum it up, our sales were down in Q3, but operating income remained flat with the improvements we made to our business, resulting in better gross margins and lower expenses. As we look into Q4 in the first half of calendar '24, we believe it's going to be tight. Look at what's happening now. Interest rates almost all-time highs, and that impacts not only consumers, but our customers as well. Credit card debt is very high. Government subsidies from the pandemic are over. After a decent holiday season amid all of these challenges, we feel the economy is slowing. And therefore, we expect the next few months may be soft, and we're going to continue to be diligent in managing our costs. However, these are the same conditions that also get the Fed to start cutting rates and stimulating the economy, and that will be good for consumers and for VOXX. The new launch of products, especially within the Consumer segment should help offset some of the economic softness and the steps to reduce overhead that have taken place should materialize further in the fourth quarter and throughout next year. Margin should also increase given new products and programs underway in those launching this year. We are in constant communication with our customers. We're managing our inventory tightly, and we're looking at all aspects of our business to get back to profitability. With that, I'd like to thank you. And then I'll turn the call over to Mike, and then we'll open it up for questions. Michael?\nCharles Michael Stoehr\nThanks, Pat, and good morning, everyone. I'll primarily cover our 9-month results and balance sheet, but first, a few comments with respect to the third quarter. As Pat mentioned, net sales were down 5.4%, gross margins grew by 90 basis points and operating expenses declined 2.1%. This resulted in operating income for both fiscal '24 and fiscal 2023 third quarters of $2.3 million. Net income attributable to VOXX was $1.9 million, which declined by approximately $5.5 million. This is principally due to a $4 million income tax benefit recorded in the prior fiscal year period compared to an expense of $100,000. Additional variance was in other income and expense. We reported total other expense of $1.4 million versus total other income of $36,000 in the comparable period -- prior period. Additionally, EBITDA was $6.5 million compared to $7.7 million and adjusted EBITDA was $8 million compared to $9 million. As for the 9-month comparisons, all numbers are for the period ended November 30, 2023, and November 30, 2022. We reported 9-month sales of $360.8 million, a decline of $36.7 million or 9.2%. Within this, Automotive segment sales were down $15.6 million with OEM product sales down $4.6 million, and aftermarket product sales down $11.1 million. Consumer segment sales were down $19.7 million with Premium Audio product sales down $31.9 million and other CE product sales up by $12.2 million. Biometric sales declined by approximately $300,000. Sales are down for the year, and we'll continue to see some pressure in Q4 consistent with Pat's remarks. Our Automotive business was impacted by the strike and customer production lines and we're hoping we'll see some more normalization in the coming quarters. Retail is tight, but we're starting to turn the corner with new products in Premium Audio and our accessory products. Those other CE products have held up well this year with solar power balcony products, wireless speakers and hearing aids, helping economic and consumer softness. We continue to take steps to improve our gross margins, which were up 170 basis points sequentially and up 50 basis points year-to-date. For the 9-month period comparisons, gross margins came in at 25.6% as compared to 25.1% with Automotive segment margins down 20 basis points and Consumer segment margins up 70 basis points. Over time, we expect Automotive margins to improve with the relocation of manufacturing to Mexico price increases and other steps we've taken to enhance our supply chain and lower costs. However, we need production to catch up. Consumer segment margins continue to improve sequentially. And again, new products should help continue to drive improvements if we maintain volume and of course, depending on product mix and customer programs. Total operating expenses. For the 9-month comparison were $110.2 million as compared to $114 million, an improvement of $3.8 million or 3.3%. Excluding acquisition and restructuring costs, total operating expenses improved by $5.3 million or 4.7%. We're continuing to look at all aspects of our operations to remove nonessential costs and are looking to lower our overhead further in light of the ongoing economic softness. We're tightly managing expenses, inventory and our cash. Selling expenses declined $3.4 million, an improvement of 9.6% versus the prior year. G&A expenses declined $1.3 million, an improvement of 2.4%, and engineering and technical support expenses declined by approximately $600,000, an improvement of 2.5%. We had restructuring costs of approximately $2.2 million related to our restructuring and manufacturing relocation programs in fiscal 2024 year-to-date. This compares approximately -- to approximately $500,000 of restructuring costs and $100,000 of acquisition costs in fiscal 2023 9-month period. We reported an operating loss of $17.7 million compared to an operating loss of $14.3 million, principally due to lower sales volume. Net loss attributable to VOXX was $19.9 million compared to a net loss of $9.3 million. EBITDA for fiscal 2024 9-month period was a loss of $6.5 million, and adjusted EBITDA was $3 million. This compares to an EBITDA loss in comparable fiscal 2023 9-month period of $3.2 million and an adjusted EBITDA of [$5.6 million].Moving on to the balance sheet. As of November 30, we had cash and cash equivalents of $10.4 million, which compares to $6.1 million as of our fiscal 2023 year-end on February 28. Cash and cash equivalents stood at $5.9 million at the end of our fiscal 2024 second quarter ended August 31. Our accounts receivable increased by $8.9 million as we're in the higher volume holiday season. Our inventory declined by $28.9 million for the 9 months as we are moving through all the product lines. We still have inventory on hand to move through, and we're focused on that given the launches underway and upcoming, especially in our Consumer segment. As I noted during our last quarterly call, we expect inventories to continue to decline as we move through the fourth and first quarters. Total debt stood at $48.6 million as compared to $39.2 million as of February 28. The increase of $9.4 million relates to a $10 million increase in our borrowings associated with our domestic credit line, partially offset by a $400,000 decline to our Florida mortgage and a $200,000 decline in the amount owed on the shareholder loan, payable to Sharp as part of our joint venture. Total long-term debt, net of debt issuance costs was $47.1 million as compared to $37.5 million as of February 28. As noted, the increase in total debt relates to the increase in our borrowings. This is typical during the third quarter as our sales and receivables increased than normally collected during the fourth quarter. This will be the case. During the fourth quarter, we'll be using our credit facility to support the final arbitration settlement, which was announced earlier this month.As reported, we entered into a settlement agreement and mutual release with Seaguard with an effective date of today, January 10. We have agreed to pay Seaguard $42 million in total, of which a payment of $10 million was already on December 27 and the final payment of $32 million will be made today. While we're not happy with the [loans], we feel it is our best interest as well as our shareholders to move forward and focus on our business and stop accruing interest and legal fees, which continue to mount. With the banking relationships in place, and the cash availability we have, the payment will be made, and we have sufficient working capital to fund our business moving forward. Of course, we're hopeful that market conditions improve sooner rather than later, and we can get back to cash flow generation and profitability. Operator, we're now ready to open the call for questions.\nGlenn Wiener\nThank you, Mike.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) And there [happen] to be no questions in the queue at this time. I'll turn the call back over to Mr. Pat Lavelle.\nPatrick M. Lavelle\nOkay. Thank you. I want to thank you for taking the time to join us this morning. I look forward to 2024 with enthusiasm as new product has always been the lifeline and the key to our growth, and we have a lot of new products scheduled for next year. So with that, thank you, and have a great day.\nOperator\nLadies and gentlemen, that does conclude conference for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.\nRelated Quotes\nTRENDING"

EBITDA represents net loss attributable to VOXX International Corporation and Subsidiaries, computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense and bank charges, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, gains on the sale of certain assets, foreign currency losses (gains), restructuring expenses, acquisition costs, certain non-routine legal fees, and awards. Depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and foreign currency losses (gains) are non-cash items.\nWe present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this release because we consider them to be useful and appropriate supplemental measures of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA helps us to evaluate our performance without the effects of certain GAAP calculations that may not have a direct cash impact on our current operating performance. In addition, the exclusion of certain costs or gains relating to certain events allows for a more meaningful comparison of our results from period-to-period. These non-GAAP measures, as we define them, are not necessarily comparable to similarly entitled measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure for performance relative to other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be assessed in isolation from, are not intended to represent, and should not be considered to be more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout\u00a0VOXX International CorporationVOXX International Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0VOXX) has grown into a leader in\u00a0Automotive Electronics\u00a0and Consumer Electronics, with emerging Biometrics technology to capitalize on the increased need for advanced security.

The extent of our growth will be very much dependent on the state of the car markets, especially now with the UAW strike, as well as consumer spending during the upcoming holiday selling season. To combat market softness, we took significant steps during the quarter to restructure our business and have reduced our operating expenses significantly. We expect restructuring and realignment initiatives to also generate higher gross margins in the second half, with more improvements planned as we move into next year. New products and programs across each of our business segments are driving our optimism, though we remain very conservative in our outlook given the state of the global economies.\"\nFiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 Second Quarter Comparisons\nNet sales in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter ended August 31, 2023, were $113.6 million as compared to $125.7 million in the Fiscal 2023 second quarter ended August 31, 2022, a decrease of $12.1 million or 9.6%. On a sequential basis as compared to the Fiscal 2024 first quarter, net sales increased by $1.7 million or 1.5%.\nAutomotive Electronics segment net sales in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter were $35.4 million as compared to $37.2 million in the comparable year-ago period, a decrease of $1.8 million or 4.8%. For the same comparable periods, OEM product sales were $16.3 million as compared to $15.2 million and aftermarket product sales were $19.2 million as compared to $22.0 million. Higher OEM product sales were driven by the fulfillment of backorders as materials became available, offset by lower sales of aftermarket products, primarily in the security and rear-seat entertainment categories.\nConsumer Electronics segment net sales in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter were $78.0 million as compared to $88.0 million in the comparable year-ago period, a decrease of $10.0 million or 11.3%. For the same comparable periods, Premium Audio product sales were $53.2 million as comparted to $69.2 million and other consumer electronics (\"CE\") product sales were $24.8 million as compared to $18.8 million. The decline in Premium Audio product sales was primarily related to ongoing softness in the economy and a decrease in consumer spending, as well as higher sales in the prior year period related to new product launches. The increase in other CE product sales was primarily driven by higher European accessory sales related to the Company's new balcony solar power products.\nBiometrics segment net sales in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter were $0.2 million as compared to $0.3 million in the comparable year-ago period, with the decline primarily related to lower licenses for the comparable periods and ongoing product shortages.\nThe gross margin in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter was 25.2% as compared to 23.3% in the Fiscal 2023 second quarter, an increase of 190 basis points. Gross margin improved 60 basis points on a sequential basis when compared to the Fiscal 2024 first quarter. For the same comparable year-ago periods, the Company reported:\nAutomotive Electronics segment gross margin of 24.3% as compared to 24.5%. The modest decline in gross margin was primarily related to lower sales of higher margin products and product mix, partially offset by the positive impact of transitioning certain manufacturing to Mexico during the second half of Fiscal 2023. The Company is beginning to realize improve margins on the sale of these products as a result of the cost savings generated from the manufacturing transition.\nConsumer Electronics segment gross margin of 25.5% as compared to 22.6%. The year-over-year improvement of 290 basis points was primarily driven by higher sales of new accessory products and improved pricing from vendors, as well as a more favorable product mix.\nBiometrics segment gross margin of 27.3% as compared to 40.1% in the comparable year-ago period.\nTotal operating expenses in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter were $37.1 million as compared to $39.2 million in the comparable Fiscal 2023 period, an improvement of $2.1 million or 5.3%. Excluding restructuring expenses, total operating expenses for the comparable Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 second quarters declined by $3.9 million or 9.9%. For the same comparable periods:\nSelling expenses of $10.0 million declined by $1.8 million or 15.5%, driven by lower commissions, employee salaries, related benefits and payroll taxes, and advertising and website expenses, as well as due to Employee Retention Credits received during the quarter, which have offset the Company's payroll tax expenses. This was offset by an increase in advertising expenses related to the Company's new hearing aid products launched in Fiscal 2024.\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $17.3 million declined by $1.6 million or 8.5% primarily due to lower legal and professional fees and a decrease in depreciation and amortization expense. This was partially offset by a modest increase in travel expense.\nEngineering and technical support expenses of $7.9 million declined by $0.4 million or 5.2%, primarily due to lower research and development expenses and cost cutting measures undertaken by the Company.\nRestructuring expenses increased by $1.8 million as the Company initiated actions to lower its headcount given market conditions, and incurred costs associated with its relocation of certain OEM production operations to Mexico.\nThe Company reported an operating loss in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter of $8.5 million as compared to an operating loss of $10.0 million in the comparable Fiscal 2023 second quarter. The Company reported an operating loss of $11.4 million in its Fiscal 2024 first quarter, representing a sequential improvement of $2.9 million.\nTotal other expense, net, in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter was $2.9 million as compared to total other expense, net, of $1.7 million in the comparable Fiscal 2023 second quarter. Interest and bank charges increased by $0.7 million and the final arbitration award associated with the Seaguard arbitration increased by $0.7 million. Equity in income of equity investee declined by $0.5 million and other, net improved by approximately $0.6 million, primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency.\nNet loss attributable to VOXX International Corporation in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter was $11.1 million as compared to a net loss attributable to VOXX International Corporation of $10.2 million in the comparable Fiscal 2023 period. The Company reported a basic and diluted loss per share attributable to VOXX International Corporation of $0.47 in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter as compared to a basic and diluted loss per common share attributable to VOXX International Corporation of $0.42, in the comparable Fiscal 2023 period.\nThe Company reported an Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (\"EBITDA\") loss in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter of $5.4 million as compared to an EBITDA loss in the comparable Fiscal 2023 second quarter of $6.8 million. Adjusted EBITDA in the Fiscal 2024 second quarter was essentially flat as compared to an Adjusted EBITDA loss in the comparable Fiscal 2023 second quarter of $3.3 million. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA improved on a sequential basis when compared to the Fiscal 2024 first quarter by $2.2 million and $4.9 million, respectively.\nFiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 Six-Month Comparisons\nNet sales in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period ended August 31, 2023, were $225.6 million as compared to $254.4 million in the Fiscal 2023 six-month period ended August 31, 2022, a decrease of $28.9 million or 11.3%.\nAutomotive Electronics segment net sales in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period were $73.8 million as compared to $76.8 million in the comparable year-ago period, a decrease of $3.0 million or 3.9%. For the same comparable periods, OEM product sales were $36.5 million as compared to $32.0 million and aftermarket product sales were $37.3 million as compared to $44.8 million. The increase in OEM product sales was driven by higher vehicle volumes under existing programs with Ford and Nissan. Lower aftermarket product sales were primarily driven by lower volumes in the security and rear-seat entertainment categories, offset by an increase in sales of satellite radio products.\nConsumer Electronics segment net sales in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period were $151.4 million as compared to $177.0 million in the comparable year-ago period, a decrease of $25.6 million or 14.5%. For the same comparable periods, Premium Audio product sales were $100.8 million as compared to $139.1 million and other consumer electronics product sales were $50.6 million as compared to $37.8 million. The decline in Premium Audio product sales was primarily related to ongoing softness in the economy and a decrease in consumer spending, as well as higher sales in the prior year period related to new product launches. The increase in other CE product sales was primarily due to higher European accessory sales of the Company's new balcony solar power products, partially offset by declines in other categories.\nBiometrics segment net sales in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period were $0.3 million as compared to $0.4 million in the comparable year-ago period, with the decline primarily related to lower licenses for the comparable periods and due to product shortages.\nThe gross margin in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period was 24.9% as compared to 24.6% in the Fiscal 2023 six-month period, an increase of 30 basis points. For the same comparable periods, the Company reported:\nAutomotive Electronics segment gross margin of 22.6% as compared to 23.3%. The 70 basis point decline in gross margin was primarily related to product mix and lower margins in the security and rear-seat entertainment categories, partially offset by the positive impact from transitioning certain manufacturing to Mexico.\nConsumer Electronics segment gross margin of 25.5% as compared to 25.0%. The year-over-year improvement of 50 basis points was primarily driven by higher sales of new accessory products, particularly the Company's new balcony solar power products and higher sales of wireless speakers. While sales of Premium Audio products declined, the Company did benefit from improved pricing from vendors, a more favorable product mix and fewer close-out promotions compared to the prior year.\nBiometrics segment gross margin of 34.0% as compared to 36.3% in the comparable year-ago period.\nTotal operating expenses in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period were $76.1 million as compared to $79.2 million in the comparable Fiscal 2023 period, an improvement of $3.0 million or 3.8%. Excluding restructuring expenses and acquisition costs, total operating expenses for the comparable Fiscal 2024 and Fiscal 2023 six month periods declined by $4.7 million or 6.0%. For the same comparable periods:\nSelling expenses of $21.2 million declined by $3.0 million or 12.3%, driven by lower commissions, employee salaries and related benefits and payroll taxes associated, as well as due to Employee Retention Credits which have offset payroll tax expenses. There were other declines in selling expenses related to ongoing cost saving measures.\nGeneral and administrative expenses of $36.7 million decreased by $1.3 million or 3.4% primarily due to lower legal and professional fees, decrease in depreciation and amortization expense, and due to lower licensing expense, among other factors, partially offset by an increase in travel expense.\nEngineering and technical support expenses of $16.2 million declined by $0.5 million or 2.9%, primarily due to lower research and development expenses and ongoing cost cutting measures.\nAcquisition costs of $0.1 million were incurred in the Fiscal 2023 six-month period associated with the acquisition of certain assets of Onkyo Home Entertainment Corporation which was completed in September 2021. There were no related costs incurred in the comparable Fiscal 2024 period.\nRestructuring expenses of $2.1 million increased by $1.8 million as the Company initiated actions to lower its headcount and other expenses during the Fiscal 2024 six-month period. Restructuring expenses in the Fiscal 2023 six-month period related to certain OEM production operations transitioned to Mexico.\nThe Company reported an operating loss in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period of $19.9 million as compared to an operating loss of $16.7 million in the comparable Fiscal 2023 period.\nTotal other expense, net, in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period was $4.5 million as compared to total other expense, net, of $3.9 million in the comparable Fiscal 2023 period. Interest and bank charges increased by $1.5 million and the final arbitration award associated with the Seaguard arbitration increased by $0.6 million. Equity in income of equity investee declined by $0.5 million and other, net improved by $2.0 million, primarily as a result of changes in foreign currency.\nNet loss attributable to VOXX International Corporation in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period was $21.8 million as compared to a net loss attributable to VOXX International Corporation of $16.7 million in the comparable Fiscal 2023 period. The Company reported a basic and diluted loss per share attributable to VOXX International Corporation of $0.92 in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period as compared to a basic and diluted loss per common share attributable to VOXX International Corporation of $0.69, in the comparable Fiscal 2023 period.\nThe Company reported an EBITDA loss in the Fiscal 2024 six-month period of $13.0 million as compared to an EBITDA loss in the comparable Fiscal 2023 period of $11.0 million.

Total debt as of August 31, 2023 was $42.8 million as compared to $39.2 million as of February 28, 2023. The increase in total debt is primarily related to a $4.1 million increase in outstanding debt on the Company's Domestic Credit Facility as a result of higher borrowings during the current period, partially offset by a $0.3 million decline associated with the Company's Florida mortgage and a $0.2 million decline in the shareholder loan payable to Sharp Corporation.

EBITDA represents net loss attributable to VOXX International Corporation and Subsidiaries, computed in accordance with GAAP, before interest expense and bank charges, taxes, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA adjusted for stock-based compensation expense, gains on the sale of certain assets, foreign currency (gains) losses, restructuring expenses, acquisition costs, certain non-routine legal fees, and awards. Depreciation, amortization, stock-based compensation, and foreign currency (gains) losses are non-cash items.\nWe present EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA in this press release because we consider them to be useful and appropriate supplemental measures of our performance. Adjusted EBITDA helps us to evaluate our performance without the effects of certain GAAP calculations that may not have a direct cash impact on our current operating performance. In addition, the exclusion of certain costs or gains relating to certain events allows for a more meaningful comparison of our results from period-to-period. These non-GAAP measures, as we define them, are not necessarily comparable to similarly entitled measures of other companies and may not be an appropriate measure for performance relative to other companies. EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA should not be assessed in isolation from, are not intended to represent, and should not be considered to be more meaningful measures than, or alternatives to, measures of operating performance as determined in accordance with GAAP.\nAbout\u00a0VOXX International Corporation\u00a0VOXX International Corporation\u00a0(NASDAQ:\u00a0VOXX) has grown into a leader in\u00a0Automotive Electronics\u00a0and Consumer Electronics, with emerging Biometrics technology to capitalize on the increased need for advanced security.

Thank you for standing by. Welcome to VOXX International Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please note that today's conference is being recorded. I\u2019ll now hand the conference over to your speaker host, Mr. Glenn Wiener. Please go ahead.\nGlenn Wiener: Thank you, Olivia. Good morning, and welcome to VOXX International's fiscal 2024 third quarter and nine month results conference call. Yesterday, we filed our Form 10-Q, and we issued our press and both documents can be found in the Investor Relations section of the website at www.voxxintl.com, and we expect to post an updated investor presentation later this week. Speaking from management today will be Pat Lavelle, Chief Executive Officer, who is currently out in Las Vegas, attending the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show; and Michael Stoehr, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. Their remarks will be followed by question and answers. As for today, I would like to remind everyone that except for historical information contained herein, statements made on today's call and webcast that would constitute forward-looking statements are based on currently available information.\nThe company assumes no responsibility to update any such forward-looking statements and I'd like you to point you to the risk factors associated with our business which are detailed in our Form 10-K for the period ended February 28, 2023. Thank you for your continued support, and I would like to now turn the call over to Pat.\nPatrick Lavelle: Thank you, Glenn, and good morning, everyone. Let me start off by wishing you all a happy and healthy new year. As Glenn said, announced with our team at CES and show kicked off yesterday. It's early, but the response to our new lineup and the various projects that we have in development has been very positive, and I'm expecting more of the same over the next few days. 2023 has been tough for everyone, not just as VOXX, our entire industry has had a very challenging year. And we're certainly happy to be turning the page. The global economy remains challenging, and we're doing all that we can to navigate through those challenges, focusing on three primary areas: protecting and growing sales in both the short and long-term, improving gross margins through supply chain and internal efficiencies, and lowering both our fixed and variable expenses.\nDuring the quarter, we were successful achieving two of these three objectives, as our gross margins grew by 90 basis points, and our operating expenses improved by a little over 2%. Sales declined roughly 5.4% with Consumer up and Automotive down. But overall, operating income was the same as the prior year. Mike will provide more financial details during his remarks, and I'll focus on the segments, what's happening and what we expect to close out the year, and as we move into fiscal 2025. So let me start with Consumer, as we have a lot of new -- news to report. Consumer sales came -- were up over 6% in Q3, with Premium Audio the driver. This is a big positive for us as the segment has been on the decline since the big bump that we had from COVID (ph).\nSee also 15 Best Places in Tennessee for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security and 15 Best Places in Ohio for a Couple to Live on Only Social Security.\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.\nRelated Quotes\nTRENDING"

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe 7 best TVs of CES 2024\nThe future of display technology, now\nCES 2024 is in full swing and with it comes yet another year of amazing innovations across a wide range of verticals. But most prominent of all fields seeing massive strides is the world of display technology, wherein a slew of AI image enhancements, transparent screens, and larger sizes are proving to push TVs that much further into the future.\nFrom Samsung to TCL, LG to Hisense, these TVs among the best at CES this year leverage interesting new software enhancements to better picture quality on the fly. Nearly every display firm is touting new leaps and bounds through investments in AI, with improved SoCs presented in the limelight as major game changers heading into 2024.\nAdditionally, as you will eventually hear, display manufacturers are taking onboard audio solutions seriously this year with many necessary upgrades on speakers to better amplify TV sound.\nMaybe most exciting of all, though, is a new string of transparent screens that will allow users increased interactivity and personalization. It might be hard to believe, but at CES 2024 the future is here and it's looking as tantalizing as an 8K OLED with a 100% color gamut.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nLG Signature OLED T\nThe LG Signature OLED T is a culmination of all the work the company has done in the last few years all rolled into one product. It uses the rollable screen technology of the LG Signature OLED R combined with the wireless connectivity box found in last year's LG M3 OLED. The result is a TV that feels utterly futuristic.\nBetween watching your favorite shows, the OLED T just looks like a pane of glass. Sure, you can have it show a firework screen saver or the weather \u2014 which, trust me, does look pretty cool \u2014 but once it's time to watch something, a matte black panel pops up that covers the back of the screen.\nThe result? You get a conversation-starting piece of furniture when you're not watching something and a perfectly fine OLED TV when it's time to turn the lights off and watch your favorite films.\nLG G4 OLED\nThe LG C3 OLED garnered immense love last year, but at CES 2024 the LG G4 OLED is the talk of the town. It leverages a ton of AI enhancements through a new A11 chipset that LG claims will grant it as much as 30% better processing speeds and 70% better graphics fidelity.\nThe G4 comes equipped with a 144Hz refresh rate, both G-Sync and FreeSync, as well as a Brightness Booster Max feature to go along with all of the awesome AI upgrades. Its One Wall Design also ensures you can fit the G4 in practically any space around the house.\nIt's a testament to LG's continued innovation in display technology and it may well put the C4 to shame this year with such incredible enhancements.\nSamsung Transparent MicroLED\nSamsung's transparent microLED is definitely more of a concept at this stage than a functioning TV, but it shows us where display technology is heading in the next few years.\nMicroLED, in case you missed it, uses billions of small LEDs to power the screen. With such a high density, the LEDs can produce a brighter, more colorful image. By adding a transparent panel, you can really get the full effect.\nSo how much will a transparent microLED TV eventually set you back? Well, considering regular microLED TVs can be tens \u2014 even hundreds \u2014 of thousands of dollars, you can bet this one won't be cheap when it eventually reaches our home entertainment centers sometime in the next few years.\nSamsung S95D OLED\nAs one of the best TVs on the market and a major seller for Samsung, it comes as no surprise that the Samsung S95D OLED is among the top displays at CES this year, much akin to the S95C OLED of yesteryear. But what makes its newer iteration so well-rounded and special to make the list two year\u2019s in the running?\nIt\u2019s simple \u2014 a glare free panel (the first of its kind) built on an Infinity One Design display with a 144Hz refresh rate, 70W 4.2.2Ch OTS+ speaker, and Dolby Atmos support. That\u2019s a ton of value packed into quite a small frame \u2014 a frame that\u2019s essentially entirely wireless thanks to Samsung\u2019s nifty Connect One Box.\nTCL QM89 QD Mini LED\nThis stunning 115-inch display takes screen size to all-new heights on a QD Mini LED screen with loads of features baked in making this TCL\u2019s crowning jewel of 2024. Beyond being a gamer\u2019s dream setup through such inclusions as FreeSync Premium and a 120Hz refresh rate (240Hz VRR), the TCL QM89 QD Mini LED sports an impressive 5,000 nits of peak brightness and 20,000 local dimming zones for an incredible range in contrasts and darks.\nTCL also packed in WiFi 6 and ATSC 3.0 tuning for a truly next-gen display. The addition of an Anti-Glare screen is also a wonderful touch, making the TCL QM89 a looker no matter the angle. Built on TCL\u2019s brand-new AIPQ Ultra chipset, the QM89 may well be one of this year\u2019s most incredible highlights and it\u2019s still only January.\nTCL QM8 QD Mini LED\nWhile it might not have that tantalizing 115-in screen, the QM8 QD Mini LED is still one of TCL\u2019s best displays at CES 2024. Unlike its larger brethren, the QM8 ranges from 65\u201d to 98\u201d, gifting it a bit more leeway in everyday households. And, as such, it essentially acts as a more accessible QM89 for those who don\u2019t need all 115-in of screen real estate.\nThe QM8 QD Mini LED is built on TCL\u2019s new AIPQ Pro processor, a step down from the QM89. But, don\u2019t let that fool you. It\u2019s still a mesmerizing screen with up to 5,000 dimming zones, 5,000 nits of peak brightness, and a 97% color gamut on the CDI-P3 scale for near-perfect vibrancy in all of your favorite content. If that wasn\u2019t enough, maybe its punchy, onboard 2.1.2 channel speaker system is?\nWell, if not, there\u2019s always the Game Accelerator to faun over, which allows the QM8 up to 240Hz VRR over its base 120Hz. Extras as seen on its larger cousin, like WiFi 6, ATSC 3.0, and FreeSync Premium Pro all round out the QM8 as an exceptional new TV offering out of CES 2024.\nHisense 110UX ULED\nAt the forefront of Hisense\u2019s 2024 lineup is the 110UX, a 110-in ULED display with a brand new Hi-View Engine X AI processor. It\u2019s a serious OLED contender, with Hisense labeling this as a potential game changer in the market due to upgrades like 10,000 nits of brightness and 40,000 backlight zones, the first of its kind in the industry.\nAnd that\u2019s only the start, as its AI chip can perform some awesome screen enhancements, like dynamically adjusted contrast and depth ratios, so you\u2019re always adamantly immersed in the action on-screen. Other notable features include a 4.2.2 channel speaker with Dolby Atmos FlexConnect support, making any audio output a surefire hit on the 110UX ULED.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.
