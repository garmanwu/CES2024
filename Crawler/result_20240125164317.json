        "raw_content": "10 wearables (and health devices) you might have missed at CES 2024\nCES 2024 has now come to a close, and we need a well-earned rest after a week of chasing down wearables across downtown Las Vegas.\nHighlights were the Movano Evie, new Garmin Lily 2, and some promising consumer smart glasses.\nBut the halls of the Expo were full of interesting wearables, far too many to report individually.\nRead on for some of the wearables you might have missed from this year's show.\nVuzix Ultralite S\nWareable\nA follow-up to the Ultralite and new for CES 2024, the sportier-looking Ultralite S also features an incognito mode so people can\u2019t see the text or visuals through the front of the smartglasses.\nVuzix is still focused on the enterprise market, although Ultralite is an OEM product that companies could use as the basis of consumer products.\nWe got to try the Ultralite S on the show floor and had a variety of demos including turn-by-turn directions, text-to-speech, and translations.\nThe Ultralite S is seriously impressive in terms of the form factor, but still very basic in the quality of the heads-up display visuals. It\u2019s also quite hard to focus on the text, and I closed one eye to read long passages of text.\nPete Jameson, COO of Vuzix revealed to Wareable that it was working on a microLED solution that would be a \u201cgame changer\u201d for smart eyewear \u2013 which was still \u201ca year and a half\u201d away.\nSennheiser Momentum Sport\nWareable\nSennheiser announced the Momentum Sport, a brand new pair of heart rate monitoring headphones, which use Polar algorithms to track your workout performance.\nThe Powered By Polar device features an optical heart rate sensor, and temperature sensor and broadcasts over Bluetooth, so it can be used by Pelotons, smartwatches and your smartphone.\nBut you can plug them into Polar Flow, and get performance analytics such as Training Load Pro, Training Benefit, and even body temperature measurements.\nStelo by Dexcom\nWareable\nWith Abbott getting into consumer CGMs with Lingo, it's no surprise that Dexcom has its product coming too. It's launched Stelo, a pared-back version of its G7 CGM, which is designed for Type 2 diabetics to understand their glucose levels. The app will track spikes and provide insights into the foods that cause high blood sugar.\nNextSense earbuds\nWareable\nThe NextSense project was born out of Google X, which certainly caught our eye \u2013 and it\u2019s led to two different products. The original project was a pair of EEG earbuds designed to offer an early warning for epileptic seizures.\nThat will be a few years away, but the same technology is being used for the NextSense sleep earbuds.\nThe same EEG tech will read your brain evaluate your sleep strategies, and enable users to work out the best way to get decent sleep. The EEG can power sleep sounds and soundscapes but also inform users about the effectiveness of treatments such as melatonin.\nIt's set to launch at the end of 2024.\nInvoxia Minitailz\nWareable\nThis pet tracker is a GPS tracker for dogs and cats \u2013 that also acts as a fitness tracker and wellness monitor. It tracks heart rate, will detect Afib, and also uses AI to warn if your pet\u2019s behaviour is changing. It can be retrofitted to your pet\u2019s existing collar.\nAmira Terra\nWareable\nThis menopause wearable will detect hot flashes from the wrist and track them within the partner app. There\u2019s also a cooling element, which uses cold water to chill a pad, which can be placed on a bed or seat to cool the body until the feeling passes and aid in better sleep.\nIdentifyHer\nIrish startup IdentityHer uses a stick-on sensor to track the symptoms of menopause. The sensor sticks to the chest, and tracks key menopausal symptoms, without the need for self-reporting.\nThe mix of sensors will track temperature, hot flashes, anxiety, and sleep. With so little research into menopause, IdentifyHer aims to help women manage their symptoms, and assess the effectiveness of treatment packages faster.\nMindLink Air\nWareable\nThese eye-tracking glasses from Canadian start-up AdHawk are designed to track the health of the brain.\nCapturing eye movements, the Mindlink Air glasses will record eye behavior and movement, blink activity, pupil dilation, gaze behavior, fixation depth, and fixation depth.\nVia the app, Mindlink will report on mental focus, and cognitive load and even assess your reading speed.\nBenzamin AI sleep controller\nBenzamin\nThis South Korean startup puts a sensor under your mattress to detect vital signs during sleep.\nThat might not sound particularly innovative, but there\u2019s more than meets the eye.\nAs well as detecting heart rate, breathing rate, and other metrics via vibrations through the mattress, it will also vibrate back, syncing to your heart rate, which it claims can boost autonomic system activity by 146% and parasympathetic nervous system activity by 116%.\nWhat does all that mean? Better sleep \u2013 but only if you live in South Korea because that's where it's launching first.\nErgoSportive smart bed\nWareable\nThis connected bed base turns your existing mattress into a smart bed and can hook up to your Garmin smartwatch. The bed base can track heart rate and respiration rate, tracking your sleep in real-time and manipulating the mattress to aid your rest. Examples could include lifting the mattress under the head if you\u2019re snoring.\nInterestingly, the bed is part of the Garmin Connectable program. That means it will populate Garmin Connect with sleep metrics if you don\u2019t want to wear your smartwatch to bed.\nHow we test\nBy James Stables\nJames is the co-founder of\u00a0Wareable, and he has been a technology journalist for 15 years.\nHe started his career at Future Publishing, James became the features editor of T3 Magazine and T3.com and was a regular contributor to TechRadar \u2013 before leaving Future Publishing to found\u00a0Wareable in 2014.\nJames has been at the helm of Wareable since 2014 and has become one of the leading experts in wearable technologies globally. He has reviewed, tested, and covered pretty much every wearable on the market, and is passionate about the evolving industry, and wearables helping people achieve healthier and happier lives."

We were featured in The Wall Street Journal and MedCity News, gained our first customers, and pitched Terra to over 500 booth visitors.\u00c2\nI was pleasantly surprised by the number of husbands who stopped by to express to us that Terra would be ideal for their wives.

They inspire us, drive us, and build bonds between us. That's why storytelling is an essential part of product design. When designing the Amira Health wearable, we approached a tough subject with hope and optimism. The final form weaves an inspiring storyline with the natural world to create a smart device that brings comfort to women worldwide.\nPartner at Nonfiction. TED speaker. Space Architect, Industrial Designer, Futurist. \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u20ac\nCase Story 07: Bringing Comfort to Menopausal Women, with Amira Health (2023)\nI've heard horror stories about the menopause. The hot flashes, the mood swings, the overwhelming discomfort of living in your body as it goes through this natural transition. Even the show Fleabag has an interesting take on why women should look forward to it: https://lnkd.in/ghrjzsZA\nThe Amira Health team initially approached us with stories of their relatives going through the hell of menopause and finding little relief from online searches and doctors' recommendations: apps, herbal remedies, changes of lifestyle, and, in the most extreme cases, hormonal therapy. Most women end up standing in front of their refrigerators for instant relief when hot flashes appear unannounced at night.\nTo help with nighttime hot flashes, the Amira team created a system that senses a hot flash approaching through a wrist wearable, then sends a signal to a hub that rushes cold water to a mattress pad underneath the woman's chest. The woman can now enjoy an undisturbed night's sleep and tackle the next day with more energy and peace.\nWhen Nonfiction designed the wearable, we took inspiration from the natural world:\n1. Earth\nAs a brand color, we chose terracotta instead of the non-commital grayscale/ pink/baby blue that often graces \"feminine\" tech. Terracotta is an abundant natural material that keeps things cool, like water urns in Ancient Greece. It is also a distinctive color that complements many skin tones.\n2. Tides\nJust like tides rush over our coasts every passing day, the rush of cold water takes over a woman's body to cancel out nighttime hot flashes. Tides exist to support the natural world and make it flourish. Cooling a woman's body replaces the overwhelming heat and sweat with instant relief so she can properly rest through the night.\n3. Moon\nWe can't talk about tides without discussing the influence of the Moon. The Moon has been the symbol of womanhood for millennia. When a woman's cycle experiences chaos (menopause), the roundness and reliability of the Moon's cycle remain supportive. This is why we wanted to make the wearable round, soft, like a pillow, always there to remind the woman that there is order in this world.\n4. Celestial Influence\nLike mass distorts the fabric of the universe, there is fluidity in how one shape connects to the next. So, instead of designing electrodes that look tacked onto a surface, we made them look like celestial bodies influencing each other. The wavy lines make that influence visually evident and elegant.\nWhat we learned: When dealing with feelings of discomfort, inadequacy, and shame, it is important to return to the natural world and be inspired by how compassionate design helps us be kinder to ourselves.\nLearn more about Amira Health: https://www.amira.care/\nCreative Direction: Phnam Bagley\nTeam: Mardis Bagley, Fifile Nguyen, Weronika (Vera) Banas, Aigerim A. Mutlu\nAmira Health reposted this\n3,077 followers\nWe\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re excited to introduce you to a project we've been actively involved in at TOOL: Amira Health, an innovative solution aimed at addressing the sleep disruption caused by menopausal hot flashes.\nAs the design partner responsible for developing the hub, we're proud to share our role in this transformative project. Amira is a dual device system with a smart wristband that detects impending hot flashes and communicates with a thermoelectric unit and pump to create a cooling effect through water circulation. Our collaboration with the Amira Health team has been marked by meticulous design and engineering, aligning with the product's cool and calming essence.\nIn the US, over 42 million women have endured sleep disruption due to hot flashes, often leading to substantial expenditures on remedies that prove ineffective. Astonishingly, one in ten women affected by this condition has had to leave their jobs due to exhaustion. Thanks to the leadership of Amira Health's CEO, Loewen Cavill, and her exceptional team at MIT, there is now hope on the horizon. Together, we've developed the first product capable of predicting and substantially reducing the severity of hot flashes, ultimately improving the sleep quality of countless women.\nWe invite you to explore more about Amira's mission and impact through Amira\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s co-founder and Head of Operations, Felipe Radovitzkye. Together, we're making a real difference in women's lives. #AmiraHealth #MenopauseRelief #Innovation #SleepQuality\nAmira Health reposted this\nImproving sleep for women experiencing nighttime hot flashes.\nWhere do AI and technology thrive?\nIn the realm of high complexity. And there's no more intricate phase of life than menopause, with over 48+ symptoms and a mere 1500 menopause providers.\nMedicine 3.0, a term coined by Dr.\u00c2\u00a0Peter Attia, aligns with Amira's journey. Amira signifies the shift to Medicine 3.0, where data-driven, proactive care is fueled by mathematics and advanced tools, unlocking the full potential of proactive healthcare.\nSo, how does\u00c2\u00a0Amira Health\u00c2\u00a0bring this vision to life?

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Wearable tech products stealing the show this year\nAs CES 2024 concludes for another year, it\u2019s an opportune moment to look back at the health and fitness gadgets that made their mark at the event in Las Vegas, which took place between January 9th and 12th.\nCES stands as the world\u2019s most significant and influential technology event. For tech aficionados, it\u2019s an unparalleled experience. Its closest counterpart is IFA, held annually in Berlin at the start of September.\nHistorically, these expos have been pivotal in introducing technologies we now consider commonplace. This year, Fitbit, Fossil, and Xiaomi disappointed with no new announcements. Consistent with previous years, Apple did not participate. Nevertheless, wearables maintained a strong presence in 2024.\nThe event sprawled across 2.75 million square feet, featuring over 2,000 exhibitors. These included manufacturers, developers, and suppliers of consumer technology hardware and content. The conference program boasted more than 1,000 speakers. It\u2019s estimated that over 100,000 attendees visited the event.\nHere\u2019s a glimpse of our top wearable tech picks from the Las Vegas showrooms. These are just a handful of our favorites. Our comprehensive coverage of CES 2024 can be found on this link.\nAmazfit Helio Ring\nOur top pick this year is the Amazfit Helio Ring, a product by Zepp Health, marking their first venture into the realm of smart rings. This device is specifically designed for athletes, focusing on optimizing recovery and enhancing performance. Unlike typical smart rings that mainly track sleep for the general public, the Helio Ring provides in-depth insights into both mental and physical conditions, a feature particularly beneficial for athletes.\nThe Helio Ring\u2019s standout feature is its ability to convert complex health data into a simple Readiness score. By monitoring sleep heart rate, HRV, breathing, and body temperature overnight, the ring, in conjunction with the Zepp App, calculates this score to help athletes decide whether to focus on training or recovery. This aids in planning workouts more effectively. The ring also offers comprehensive sleep and recovery tracking, including analysis of sleep quality, sleep stages, and sleep breathing quality. Additionally, it features EDA emotional monitoring, which assesses physical signs like hand sweat to indicate emotional stress.\nMind you, this is not the only smart ring which made its appearance. Also there were RingConn with their excellent offering, along with Evie Ring, Velia Ring, YogiFi Ring and Dcare Ring. Its shaping up to be an exciting year for smart rings!\nWithings BeamO\nNext up on our list is the Withings BeamO, a groundbreaking health monitoring device that combines the futuristic vision of Star Trek with practical technology. BeamO allows users to perform a 4-in-1 health checkup, including body temperature, heart, and lung health, in under a minute.\nBeamO, the world\u2019s 1st multiscope for revolutionary at-home checkups, was unveiled at #CES2024 \u2014 our booth has been packed with people and the awards just keep coming.If you couldn\u2019t make it to CES or get through the crowds, here\u2019s PM Livia Robic with a personal demo for you. pic.twitter.com/LqZrk9ljzO\nThe thing functions as a thermometer, ECG, oximeter, and stethoscope, using photoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodes for accurate readings. BeamO also features a non-contact temperature sensor and a digital stethoscope with a Piezoelectric disc for detailed heart and lung assessments. The data syncs with the Withings Health app, providing insights and enabling telehealth consultations.\nPriced at $249.95 the device is set to be available in June 2024. BeamO is recognized as a CES Innovations Award Honoree and represents a significant advancement in home health monitoring technology.\nGarmin Lily 2\nAnother standout device from CES 2024 is the Garmin Lily 2, a successor to the original Garmin Lily launched in 2021. The Lily 2 retains the stylish and functional appeal of its predecessor but introduces several notable upgrades. It features an improved heart rate sensor, new fitness modes, and NFC payments.\nDesign-wise, the model retains a classic round shape, but the Lily 2 upgrades the build to anodized aluminum for enhanced durability and sophistication. The Lily 2 also simplifies band switching with a more standard lug design. As before, there\u2019s a TFT LCD with 16-level grayscale on-board. The Lily 2 stands out with its Gen 4 Elevate sensor, improving health and fitness tracking, and introduces NFC for contactless payments, a feature absent in the original Lily. Priced slightly higher than the original, the Lily 2 offers a blend of fashion, functionality, and fitness tracking, making it a compelling choice for those seeking a stylish, compact wearable.\nGarmin HRM-Fit\nAlso among our favorite picks from CES 2024 is the Garmin HRM-Fit, a heart rate monitor specifically designed for women. Priced at $150, it offers a snug fit and is compatible with medium to high support sports bras, accommodating a variety of body types. Its design ensures stability and comfort during intense workouts, although it\u2019s advised not to use it with certain types of bras like longline, front zip, and light support variants.\nFunctionally, the HRM-Fit excels in providing precise heart rate data, surpassing the accuracy of wrist-based devices. It supports advanced workout tracking, including metrics like vertical oscillations, ground contact time, and stride length, crucial for detailed running form analysis. With a battery life of up to one year (based on daily one-hour usage) and water resistance up to 50 feet, it\u2019s built for endurance and versatility.\nNowatch hybrid\nNowatch, a Dutch startup, has evolved from a mindful health tracker to a sophisticated hybrid smartwatch, showcased at CES 2024. The original Nowatch, known for its stress prediction using an electrodermal sensor (EDA), has now incorporated Chronos \u2018timepiece faces\u2019, adding the functionality of time display while maintaining its focus on mindfulness and stress awareness.\nThe AI Insights feature provides daily summaries and recommendations based on the wearer\u2019s stress data, sleep, and activity stats. The design of Nowatch, featuring interchangeable discs made of polished metal and gemstones, emphasizes wearability and style. This evolution marks Nowatch\u2019s journey in the wearable technology space, focusing on aesthetics, mindfulness, and a user-customizable experience.\nUltrahuman Home\nUltrahuman has introduced Ultrahuman Home at CES 2024, a device that tracks and enhances the health of living spaces. This innovative product extends Ultrahuman\u2019s wearable tech expertise to environmental health monitoring. It provides insights into factors like artificial light, air quality, humidity, and noise levels, correlating them with individual lifestyle factors such as sleep and stress.\nIntroducing Ultrahuman Home! It is a sleek yet powerful device that will provide insights on an individual's external environment including exposure to artificial light, air quality, humidity and noise levels. It\u2019s a first for the wearable space to leverage home health data and\u2026 pic.twitter.com/SV33UHFp2q\nUltrahuman Home offers a longitudinal view of environmental markers and their impact on health over time, featuring capabilities like natural light spectrum monitoring, PM detection, noise detection, humidity level monitoring, and blue light exposure monitoring. Set to launch on Kickstarter for USD $349, Ultrahuman Home represents a novel approach to integrating personal and environmental health monitoring.\nMomentum Sport Earbuds\nThe Sennheiser Momentum Sport Earbuds, a result of the collaboration between Polar and Sennheiser, were also introduced at CES 2024. These earbuds combine Sennheiser\u2019s renowned sound quality with Polar\u2019s advanced fitness tracking technologies. They feature a semi-open design, active noise cancellation, and an anti-wind mode, making them ideal for outdoor activities.

        "raw_content": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

It's an exhilarating time to be part of the tech world. Each year, I eagerly anticipate a few key events, and CES, the Tech Mecca, is undoubtedly at the top of my list. This event is a global stage where renowned brands unveil their latest innovations in smart homes, health, vehicles, E.V., mobility, beauty, entertainment tech, and more.\nOn a personal note, I dream of witnessing the advent of an 'integrated domestic agent' - a smart system that epitomizes the 'Zero Labor Home Experience' through Affectionate Intelligence (A.I.). This system would cater to my family's needs, especially in my absence, handling everything from restocking essentials to providing convenient and immediate retail experiences. Companies like L.G. and Walmart are making significant strides in this direction, and I'm excited about the possibilities!\nCES 2024 stunned me with its showcase of how technology reshapes industries in unimaginably innovative ways. Sharing the highlights of this event has been an exhilarating experience.\nNavigating Consumer Spending in Tech\nDelving into the consumer technology market, it's insightful to examine consumer spending patterns. The lion's share goes to food, health, and prestige beauty, as people today prioritize experiences and global travel. Interestingly, the tech industry faced challenges in 2023, with significant growth driven by true consumer demand. The lesson for consumer tech is clear: high-quality, affordable products are essential in these economic times. E-commerce accounts for 60% of sales, with technology leading online retail and third-party marketplaces. A 'Socialverse-first' approach is becoming increasingly prevalent.\nThe Big Trends at CES 2024\nA predominant theme at CES 2024 was the ubiquity of A.I.. This technology has transitioned from machine learning to deep learning to generative A.I., transforming everything from personal assistants to smart cities. The CES event highlighted how industries from automotive to beauty are focusing on breaking silos to create personalized, omnichannel experiences with digital twins. Launching platforms like ChatGPT and Bard in 2023 has made A.I. more user-friendly and integral to our lives, enhancing productivity and creativity across various sectors.\nThe Growing Software Pivot\nA significant trend is the software pivot, with the total 2024 U.S. Consumer Technology Revenues hitting $512 Billion. A third of these revenues are attributed to Software Services, driven by audio, video, gaming, and entertainment software.\nGlobal Connectivity and Digital Infrastructure\nThe current state of global connectivity is remarkable, with 5.4 billion people connected to the internet. The focus is now on next-generation connectivity, such as 5G/6G, to ensure advanced IoT/Edge and Li-Fi connectivity. This digital infrastructure balances tech advancement between consumer needs and enterprise growth.\nHealthcare, Mobility, and Sustainable Futures\nWe're seeing groundbreaking developments in digital health, offering personalized treatments and wellness solutions. The push for a sustainable future is evident in various sectors, from electric mobility to renewable energy. CES 2024 showcased innovative solutions like graphene-based batteries and investment in alternative energy sources.\nTransformative trends in media and streaming\nThe media and streaming landscape witnessed transformative trends at CES 2024, marking a significant shift in consumer experiences. Television has evolved into a powerful e-commerce platform, enabling seamless shopping while watching content and bridging the gap between entertainment and retail. The audio domain experienced a surge, driven by the rise of social media streamers, the evolution of podcasts, and innovative superfan monetization methods, fostering more interactive and engaged media consumption. Additionally, the new age of streaming platforms showcased a shift from traditional demographics to diverse audiences, with practices such as interoperable partnerships, novel content bundling (e.g., HBO Max and Netflix collaborations), live sports broadcasts, and multilingual support, reflecting the industry's commitment to enhancing audience engagement and advertising strategies.\nTechnological Advancements in Gaming and Societal Applications\nAt CES 2024, the gaming industry took center stage, with remarkable advancements fueling its evolution. Notably, there's a surge in IP expansion, AI integration in game development, and the revival of classic games with modern graphics, transforming gaming into a more social and immersive experience. Furthermore, the intersection of technology and agriculture, known as Agritech, played a vital role in ensuring food security by embracing advanced solutions and moving away from traditional farming practices. The event also emphasized the significance of tech policy and privacy, balancing fostering innovation and safeguarding consumer privacy. Lastly, spatial computing emerged as a game-changer, influencing multiple sectors, including gaming, autonomous vehicles, and holographic technologies, enhancing interactive experiences and safety\nCES 2024 witnessed an impressive lineup of innovative offerings from leading brands. L'Oreal took center stage, revolutionizing the beauty industry with augmented beauty technology, featuring advancements like proxylane for skin regeneration and Melasyl for diversity and personalization. Qualcomm showcased pioneering chip technology, emphasizing low-power, high-performance computing with integrated AI for privacy and connectivity. Nasdaq showcased its commitment to combating financial crime through data and AI-driven predictive analysis, collaborating with tech giants like Microsoft and AWS. Moderna made strides in healthcare by harnessing AI for drug development and clinical workflow optimization. Google introduced AI-powered features to enhance Android user experiences, while experts like Andrew Ng and Fei-Fei Hu shared insights on AI's potential across industries. Siemens and Nvidia addressed global challenges like climate change and food security with industrial solutions, while Deloitte focused on designing intelligent, connected devices for health empowerment and digital shopping. Intel emphasized flexible and secure computing, and L.G. advanced smart home technology with their ThinQ platform, focusing on electrification, energy management, and sustainability.\"\nProduct Launches at CES\nPredictions for 2024 and Beyond\nThe future of technology is geared towards personalization at scale, anticipating consumer behavior, and enhancing network effects, marking a transition from reactive to proactive tech solutions.\nCES 2024 was a revelation, showcasing how technology, from A.I. to sustainable solutions, is evolving and revolutionizing our world. Each innovation underscored the importance of the human element in technology \u00e2\u20ac\u201d making life richer, more convenient, and truly personalized. This event didn't just preview the future; it showed how we're actively crafting it, turning what once seemed like dreams into tangible realities.\n#industrialmetaverse #TransformTheEveryday\nCES\nGroup-Level Leader at RIL\nFabulous \u00f0\u0178\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\u0178\ufffd\u00bd\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\nMore articles by this author\nIdea in brief \u00e2\u20ac\u201d FTX implosion and what\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s next?\nI think I've figured out how FinServ Industry is unifying Customer Experience!\nSign in\nStay updated on your professional world\nBy clicking Continue, you agree to LinkedIn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s User Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.\nNew to LinkedIn?

Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."
