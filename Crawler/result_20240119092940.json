Gotech Int\u2019l Tech. Ltd., Case No. 16-20817 (5th Cir., Feb. 7, 2018) (Reavley, J).\nNagravision SA, a Swedish company, filed suit against Gotech International Technology Ltd. and Zhuhai Gotech Intelligent Technology Co. Ltd., both Chinese companies (collectively, Gotech), alleging violations of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Federal Communications Act. Gotech deliberately ignored the lawsuit, resulting in a $100 million default judgment in favor of Nagravision. After Nagravision initiated enforcement proceedings in a Hong Kong court and successfully froze Gotech\u2019s assets, Gotech filed a motion under Rule 60(b) for relief from the default judgment. After the district court denied the motion, Gotech appealed.\nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed, rejecting all of Gotech\u2019s purported grounds for relief. The Court summarily rejected Gotech\u2019s request for relief under Rule 60(b)(1) because Gotech\u2019s willful default precluded relief on grounds of \u201cmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\u201d Thus, the court reasoned that Gotech\u2019s only remaining possibility for relief was Rule 60(b)(4)\u2019s narrow provision for relief from a judgment that is \u201cvoid.\u201d\nThe Fifth Circuit rejected Gotech\u2019s argument that Nagravision lacked standing to bring its claims. The Court agreed with Nagravision that it had an injury traceable to Gotech\u2019s misdeeds in the form of Gotech\u2019s software and hardware that misappropriated Nagravision technology and defeated Nagravision security, and that therefore Article III standing existed. The Court also rejected Gotech\u2019s statutory standing arguments because a lack of statutory standing does not render a judgment void.\nNext, the Fifth Circuit rejected Gotech\u2019s argument regarding lack of federal question jurisdiction because the DMCA does not apply to violations of foreign intellectual property rights. The Court held that Gotech\u2019s argument improperly conflated a failure to state a claim with subject matter jurisdiction, finding that the assertion of the claim gave rise to federal question jurisdiction.\nThe Fifth Circuit also rejected Gotech\u2019s argument that Nagravision failed to effect proper service because Nagravision did not serve Gotech through the Hague Convention. The Court found that Nagravision properly served Gotech by court-ordered email under Rule 4(f)(3)\u2014a court-ordered service not prohibited by international agreement\u2014rather than Rule 4(f)(1).\nFinally, the Fifth Circuit rejected Gotech\u2019s argument that the district court lacked personal jurisdiction under Rule 4(k)(2) because Nagravision had not shown that Gotech was \u201cnot subject to jurisdiction in any state\u2019s court of general jurisdiction.\u201d The Court recognized the tension between the plaintiff\u2019s burden to establish personal jurisdiction and the burden on the party seeking relief from a default judgment. It held that, on this particular question, Gotech bore the burden of establishing that it was subject to some other state\u2019s jurisdiction, which it did not do.\nPractice Note:\u00a0The grounds for relief available under Rule 60(b) are narrow, especially when a party has actual notice of a lawsuit pending against it and chooses not to respond. Standing and jurisdictional issues are fact specific and often have unclear answers. In the defendant\u2019s absence, the court, aided only by the plaintiff, must decide these difficult issues. A defendant that has actual notice of a pending lawsuit can instead assert these defenses through a Rule 12(b) motion\u2014improving its chances to persuade the court while avoiding waiver of other available defenses.\nadd to folder:\nFiled under\nLaws\nCourts\nPopular articles from this firm\nIf you would like to learn how Lexology can drive your content marketing strategy forward, please email [email\u00a0protected].\nRelated practical resources PRO\nRelated research hubs\n\u00a9 Copyright 2006 - 2024 Law Business Research"

        "raw_content": "Angela Wang & Co.\nWhen proceedings are commenced in Hong Kong, it is a general procedural requirement that the Plaintiff must effect personal service of the originating process, i.e. a writ of summons or an originating summons, on the Defendant. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, due to quarantine requirements or other travel or border restrictions, personal service of court documents in Hong Kong has become even more difficult.\nSubstituted Service where Defendant Cannot be Found\nWhat happens if a Defendant is an individual whose address in Hong Kong is unknown, cannot return to Hong Kong due to travel or border restrictions, has to stay in quarantine, or has absconded after committing the wrongdoing and thereby making personal service impracticable ?\nThe law recognizes the practical difficulties of service in such situations and allows an alternative way of service by way of substituted service.\nOrder 65 rule 4 of the Rules of the High Court (Cap 4A) provides that the Court may make an order for substituted service where it appears to the Court that for any reason, it is impracticable to serve any document required to be served personally on the Defendant.\nTo make an application for substituted service, the Plaintiff must satisfy the Court that (1) personal service is impracticable because personal service on the Defendant was attempted but failed and that the Plaintiff has exhausted all reasonable means to personally serve on the Defendant, and (2) the proposed mode(s) of substituted service can reasonably likely bring notice of the proceedings to the Defendant.\nWhere the Defendant\u2019s address is unknown / cannot be located but there is evidence tending to show that the Defendant may still be within Hong Kong, substituted service by way of publication of the proceedings on newspapers widely circulated in Hong Kong is commonly ordered by the court.\nIn the case of an individual who has absconded to overseas but is known to the Plaintiff that he has legal representatives in Hong Kong and that the Defendant may be contactable through the legal representatives, service on the legal representatives in Hong Kong may be proposed in the substituted service application, which mode of substituted service has in some previous cases been held by the Court to be valid substituted service.\nNovel Modes of Substituted Service by Electronic Means\nHowever, whilst it is observed that Order 65 rule 4 does not expressly prescribe any specific modes of substituted service / prohibit certain modes of substituted service, the Hong Kong Courts tend to prefer traditional modes of substituted service such as by postal mail or advertisement.\nOn the contrary, substituted service through electronic means, such as email, Facebook or WeChat, which are now prevalently in use and in some cases may be the only known contact information of the Defendant, had been rejected by the Court.\nThis may leave little to no viable option for the Plaintiff to serve the proceedings in order to pursue the claim.\nHowever, in the recent High Court case of Zhuhai Gotech Intelligent Technology Co Ltd v Persons Unknown (HCZZ 10/2020), where the Plaintiff was victim of certain Facebook pages operated by unknown persons passing off pirated satellite television subscription services provided by the Plaintiff, the Court has, for the first time, allowed substituted service through the novel mode of sending soft copies of the Court documents to the Defendants via Facebook messaging.\nGranting the order of substituted service through Facebook messaging, the Court in the above case recognized, among other things, that (1) Order 65 rule 4 could empower the Court to allow substituted service by electronic means even in the absence of express wording allowing it; (2) the Defendants could otherwise not be served without the Plaintiffs incurring great costs in seeking the identity and contact information of the Defendants; and (3) the previous case of Deacons v Stanley Wu (unrep., DCCJ 1133/2010, 16 July 2010) where the proposed mode of substituted service by email was rejected was decided 10 years ago and should be distinguished from this case because the technology was still at a premature stage at that time.\nThe Zhuhai Gotech Intelligent case may therefore mark the beginning of a paradigm shift of the Court\u2019s attitude from only allowing traditional modes of substituted service to embracing novel modes of substituted service through electronic means or social media platforms, riding the waves of technology and adapting to changes in society.\nIn light of the above, where the Plaintiff has made efforts to locate and personally serve the Defendant but in vain, the Plaintiff may now have the additional recourse to search for the Defendant\u2019s social media accounts and apply for substituted service on the Defendant via messaging on such social media platforms.\nIt is noted however that as this is still an early stage of development in the jurisprudence of such new modes of substituted service, whilst Plaintiffs and claimants may now have the choice to apply for these new modes of substituted service, traditional mode(s) of substituted service are still encouraged to be proposed as alternatives in the substituted service application to increase the likelihood of success.\nIf you have any questions on the above eNews or require advice on dispute matters, experience lawyers in our Litigation and Dispute Resolution team will be happy to assist you.\n14th Floor South China Building1-3 Wyndham Street, Central, Hong Kong"

Since 2003\nKudelski strikes blow against piracy; Gotech banned from IBC\nSeptember 9, 2016 21.47 Europe/London By Chris Dziadul\nKudelski\u2019s sister company Nagravision has been awarded a final default judgment worth $101 million by the US District Court for the Southern District of Texas in a lawsuit against China\u2019s Zhuhai Gotech Intelligent Technology Co. Ltd. and two related companies.\nNagra filed the case alleging Gotech\u2019s technologies and services were primarily designed and intended to circumvent content protection technologies. Kudelski Security and Nagra Content Protection Services carried out the identification and forensic investigation of the defendants and their alleged pirate activities.\nIn the wide-ranging lawsuit, Nagra argued that Zhuhai Gotech Intelligent Technology Co., Ltd., Gotech International Technology Ltd., and Globalsat International Technology Ltd. manufactured and distributed unauthorised set-top boxes under brand names including Globalsat, AZAmerica, NAZABox, Captiveworks and Lamest.\nFurthermore, they operated Internet Key Sharing (IKS) servers from servers located in the US, thereby violating the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), as well as the Federal Communications Act (FCA).\nCommenting on the development, Maurice van Riek, senior VP, head of content and asset security for Nagra, said: \u201cWe have demonstrated in our security labs that Gotech has impacted every major conditional access system (CAS) and is also providing an illegal content sharing solution, impacting pay-TV operators everywhere.\n\u201cWe appreciate that the damage caused by the wrongdoing of Gotech has been recognised by the judge and that the court has ordered Gotech to stop harming our industry with their products and practices.\u201d\nFrederic Guitard, VP media security services for Kudelski Security, added: The pleasure that billions of people around the world get from television every day is dependent on the ability of the legitimate value chain to capture fair value for its hard work.\n\u201cWhen pirates illegally divert the flow of money away from legitimate content creators and distributors, the whole industry and ultimately the end consumer will suffer. That\u2019s why it\u2019s our mission to identify and manage piracy on behalf of our customers, even as it continues to evolve and morph on a daily basis.\u201d\nIn addition to ordering the damage payment, United States District Judge Kenneth M. Hoyt also enjoined Gotech from manufacturing and selling any equipment or offering any services that could be used for piracy, as well as ordering Gotech to turn over any existing equipment or software that could be used to commit piracy.\nIn addition, the judge\nordered third parties providing services that enable Gotech\u2019s alleged piracy to stop doing so, and\nordered the ownership of Gotech\u2019s primary website domain to be transferred to Nagra.\nIn a related move, organisers of the IBC Exhibition in Amsterdam this week have banned Gotech from exhibiting this year.\nKudelski Security\nestimates that there were more than three million end users connected to various Gotech servers.\nRelated\nFiled Under: Conditional Access/Security, IBC Special, Newsline, Tech Tagged With: Gotech, Kudelski, Nagra Kudelski Edited: 9 September 2016 21:47\nExclusive Case Study: Learn how Orange has bet on Dolby technologies to build customer loyalty with a premium offering.\nPicture and sound quality increase Orange user engagement, increasing their content consumption.\n\u2018\"The only way to ensure [the best experience] was for our new service to include Dolby technologies,\" says Ana L\u00f3pez Zamarre\u00f1o, Head of TV Product at Orange Spain\u00a0 \u2026 [Download the Case Study ...]\nEXCLUSIVE: Q&A with Erwan Luherne, MD of SPI International\nBroadband TV News speaks exclusively with Erwan Luherne, MD of SPI International, about the company and its plans for the future.\nMediaKind: IBC2023 Round-up interview\nRuwido: IBC2023 Round-up interview\nBedrock: IBC2023 Round-up interview\nAll the Stories from the IBC Special\nCopyright \u00a9\u00a02024 Broadband TV News LLP \u00b7 Log in"

        "raw_content": "Gotech's remote monitors likely to save elderly lives\nZhuhai Gotech Intelligent Technology Co Ltd has developed the world's first intelligent household nursing system for the elderly. It consists of a set of devices to monitor real-time health data, safeguarding timely first aid when needed.\nThe products, dubbed \"24-hour maid,\" allow civil affairs staff to read heart rate and blood pressure via apps on mobile phones or telescreens. In case of emergency, medical staff can rush to rescue in the shortest possible time.\nAn integrated service platform, the smart home device provides health monitoring, nursing services for the aged, remote communications, and data sharing. It uses a wide range of high technologies such as internet, mobile internet, internet of things (IOT), big data, and cloud computing.\nGotech products displayed\nGotech was founded in Hongqi Town of Jinwan District in June 2008 and has grown into a leading manufacturer of digital television reception devices. It also provides R&D and technological achievement transfer services of audiovisual decoders, 3D multi-media, and computer software and support services.\nThe company started to transform from a hardware manufacturer to a service and solutions provider three years ago. It has become a comprehensive enterprise owning various products and services such as an intelligent multi-media terminal, smart home, smart community, smart safeguard, intelligent and energy-efficient LED, and digital operating service platforms. It sells products all over the world.\nThe company integrates the Internet into a set-top box (STB) in response to the concept of \"Internet Plus\" put forward by China's Prime Minister Li Keqiang. The three highlights of its STB and smart home boast are: community project for seniors, family healthmate, and smart home product.\nBased on specialization and diversification, Gotech aims to upgrade from a product supplier to a business operator and service provider in the audiovisual industry. It is focusing on smart home, smart city, intelligent healthcare, military-civilian integration, intelligent illumination, and intelligent manufacturing, said Miu Keliang, chairman of the board.\nGotech workshop [Photos by Zhang Zhou / Zhuhai Daily]\nThe company relies upon innovation. A company can stay unbeaten only when constant efforts are put into research for new technologies and products, noted Miu.\nGotech generated 1.3 billion yuan ($191 million) in output value last year and anticipates 1.8 billion to 2 billion yuan (up to $294 million) this year, striving to exceed 2.5 billion to 3 billion yuan (up to $441 million) next year.\nIt will take advantage of Zhuhai's vital role in the Belt & Road Initiative and endeavor to expand its overseas market, Miu added.\nMOST POPULAR\nEditors' Picks\nLEAVE YOUR MESSAGE\nCopyright\u00a92024 China Daily.

These proceedings arise in respect of the production, promotion and sale of set top boxes and receivers allegedly designed to circumvent the Plaintiff\u2019s technological protection measures, thereby enabling users to decrypt and view pay television broadcasts without paying for them.\n2. The 1st and 2nd Defendants took out the summons dated 3 July 2010 (the \u201cSummons\u201d) applying for: (i) summary disposal of the case on certain points of law under O14A of the RHC; and (ii) a trial of preliminary issue on locus to make one of the Plaintiff\u2019s claims under O33 r3 of the RHC. I refused the application in the hearing on 23 June 2020. I now give my reasons.\nBACKGROUND\n3. The Plaintiff is a company incorporated in Switzerland providing security technology to the pay-television (\u201cPay TV\u201d) industry. The Plaintiff\u2019s technology is used by its broadcaster clients to ensure that customers have paid for their subscriptions before being allowed to view Pay TV. The Plaintiff\u2019s technology consists of set top boxes installed with smart cards, comprising the Plaintiff\u2019s security software, used to decrypt the encrypted Pay TV broadcasts.\n4. The Plaintiff\u2019s technology involves the use of \u201ccontrol words\u201d that are channel-specific and change automatically every 5 to 10 seconds for each channel. The Plaintiff\u2019s control words are transmitted to subscribers along with the encrypted audio and video streams of the Pay TV broadcaster. The Plaintiff sets up a head-end at the broadcaster\u2019s base station which the Plaintiff uses to send the control words in encrypted packets known as Entitlement Control Messages (\u201cECMs\u201d). These ECMs are then combined with the encrypted audio and video streams of the Pay TV broadcaster to be sent to the subscriber. A smart card installed in a subscriber\u2019s set top box will decrypt the ECMs using secret cryptographic keys stored inside the smart card memory. The smart card will then confirm that the subscriber has purchased the right to watch the programme and decrypt the control words. The set top box will then use the decrypted control words to unscramble the audio and video streams for the desired programme.\n5. The 1st Defendant is a limited company incorporated in the Mainland carrying on the business of manufacturing and selling of digital set top boxes which are also known as \u201creceivers\u201d. The 2nd Defendant is limited company incorporated in Hong Kong. It is a subsidiary of the 1st Defendant carrying on the business of selling, distributing and marketing of set top boxes manufactured by the 1st Defendant in the Mainland. It is the Plaintiff\u2019s case that the 3rd and 4th Defendants are involved in the same group of companies.\n6. The acts of the Defendants under complaint in these proceedings include providing an illicit \u201cInternet Key Sharing Service\u201d (named G-Share) which allows users of the set top boxes manufactured by the Defendants to circumvent the Plaintiff\u2019s technology protection measures and watch Pay TV without paying for it, including via the Defendants\u2019 G-Share Internet Key Sharing servers and online forums, set up using servers located in the United States.\n7. The Plaintiff made a civil claim against the 1st to 3rd Defendants (the \u201cUS Defendants\u201d) in the United States District Court, Southern District Court of Texas (the \u201cUS District Court\u201d). On 18 August 2016, the US District Court handed down the Judgment with reasons against the US Defendants in default of appearance (the \u201cUS Judgment\u201d). The court found that the US Defendants had violated the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the \u201cDMCA\u201d) and the Federal Communications Act (the \u201cFCA\u201d), and awarded statutory damages of US$101,851,800 based on the US Defendants\u2019 509,259 violations of s 1201(a)(2) of the DMCA at US$200 (being the minimum statutory damages for each infringement) per violation.\n8. The US Defendants applied to the US District Court on 18 October 2016 to set aside the US Judgment. The application was dismissed in early December 2016.\n9. The US Defendants filed a further appeal with the United States Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, and an oral hearing was held on 9 November 2017. After full briefing and oral arguments by lawyers on both sides, the appeal was dismissed on 7 February 2018. The US Defendants\u2019 subsequent application to the United States Supreme Court for an order of certiorari was refused on 13 November 2018.\n10. In Hong Kong, the Plaintiff brought the present proceedings against the Defendants in 2016 which include the following causes of action:\n(i) a claim at common law to enforce damages of US$101,851,800 awarded against the US Defendants in the US Judgment (the \u201cUS Judgment Claim\u201d);\n(ii) further or alternatively, if the US Judgment is not enforceable at common law, a claim for damages directly in Hong Kong under the provisions of United States law under the DMCA and the FCA (the \u201cUS Law Claim\u201d);\n(iii) claim under s 275(2) of the Copyright Ordinance, Cap 528 (the \u201cOrdinance\u201d) for dealing in apparatus or devices designed or adapted to enable or assist the unauthorised reception of transmissions or publishing information which is calculated to enable or assist the unauthorised reception of transmissions (the \u201cS 275 Claim\u201d); and\n(iv) claim under ss 30 and 31 of the Ordinance for dealing in copies of the Plaintiff\u2019s copyright works which are loaded onto the Defendants\u2019 devices, in particular set top boxes (the \u201cSS 30 and 31 Claim\u201d).\n11. The Plaintiff successfully applied for Mareva injunction against the Defendants.\n12. The 4th Defendant\u2019s application to discharge the Mareva injunction was dismissed by Recorder Houghton SC in his decision dated 16 May 2017.\n13. The Defendants\u2019 applications to discharge the Mareva injunction and to challenge jurisdiction were dismissed, following a 4-days\u2019 hearing, by DHCJ Francis in his decision dated 14 June 2018 (the \u201cFrancis\u2019 Decision\u201d)[1].\n14. In the Summons, the 1st and 2nd Defendants ask the court to determine the following 6 issues under O14A procedure:\n(1) Whether the US Judgment made against the US Defendants by the US District Court on 18 August 2016:\n(a) is a judgment for multiple damages within the meaning of ss 7(1) and (3) of the Protection of Trading Interests Ordinance, Cap. 471 (\u201cPTIO\u201d) (the \u201cPTIO Issue\u201d); and/or\n(b) further or alternatively, is oppressive and grossly excessive in its amount and/or is penal in nature and/or offends substantial justice in that it is not computed on the basis of, and bears no relation to, damages based on compensatory, restitution or disgorgement principles (the \u201cPenal Issue\u201d); and\n(c) if yes in (a) or (b) above, whether the US Judgment is enforceable in Hong Kong and whether the court in Hong Kong has jurisdiction to award damages in lieu of the damages awarded under the US Judgment (the \u201cEnforcement Issue\u201d).\n(2) Whether the Plaintiff\u2019s claims based on the DMCA and the FCA:\n(a) are justiciable in Hong Kong (the \u201cJusticiability Issue\u201d); or\n(b) fall foul of the rule against double actionability if the Plaintiff does not have the locus to bring the S 275 Claim as so found in the trial of preliminary issue as mentioned below (the \u201cDouble Actionability Issue\u201d); or\n(c) are barred against enforcement in Hong Kong under s 5(1) of the Foreign Judgments (Restriction on Recognition and Enforcement) Ordinance, Cap. 46 (the \u201cFJ(RRE)O\u201d), and/or the Plaintiff is estopped at common law from claiming relief as its alleged causes of action have merged into the US Judgment (the \u201cFJ(RRE)O Issue\u201d).\n15. The 1st and 2nd Defendants also seek an order for trial on preliminary issue as to whether the Plaintiff has the standing and capacity to make the S 275 Claim (the \u201cS 275 Locus Issue\u201d).\nDECISION ON THE O14A APPLICATION\n16. In my judgment, it is not appropriate for the court to invoke the O14A procedure to determine the issues or points of law framed by the 1st and 2nd Defendants for the following reasons:\n(i) the issues raised in these \u201cpoints of law\u201d involve disputes of mixed law and fact, making it inappropriate for the court to decide the various \u201cpoints of law\u201d by way of O14A procedure;\n(ii) given the history of the present litigation, the conduct of the O14A hearing at this stage would not result in the efficient disposal of the case.\n(a) The \u201cpoints of law\u201d involve disputes of mixed law and fact\n17. It is trite law that O14A procedure is not appropriate for determination of issues involving disputes of fact or mixed law and fact. Further, such kind of application cannot be dealt with by the court on the basis of assumed or hypothetical facts.[2]\n18. The first two issues, i.e. the PTIO and Penal Issues, are relevant to the Plaintiff\u2019s US Judgment Claim. It the Defendants\u2019 case that the award in the US Judgment, i.e. the sum of US$101,851,800 calculated by reference to the Defendants\u2019 509,259 violations of s 1201(a)(2) of the DMCA at US$200 per violation, involves \u201cmultiple...\nTo continue reading\nSubscribers can access the reported version of this case.\nYou can sign up for a trial and make the most of our service including these
