With a total investment of 2.2 billion yuan (about USD\u00a0318.6 million), this initiative serves as the first large-scale project for photomask production equipment in the inland of China.\nThe launching ceremony of the photomask project in Liangjiang New Area. (Photo/Zhang Weizhen)\nA photomask, a crucial tool for producing components such as electronic devices (semiconductors), displays, PCBs, and MEMS, serves as a master copy for patterning. The project is situated in Chongqing's Liangjiang New Area.\nAccording to Takada Mari, Japanese Consul-General in Chongqing, the project stands as the most representative large-scale investment by Japanese companies in recent years. She believes the project will significantly contribute to the prosperity of Chongqing's electronic information industry.\nHoya Corporation, a world-leading photomask manufacturer, excels in the fields of optical imaging, electronic equipment and components, and medical devices. Meanwhile, BOE Technology Group ranks first in smartphones, tablets, laptops, and display device shipments. The collaboration between these two industry giants is expected to drive the industrial upgrade of display panels in Liangjiang New Area and complete the industrial chains in Chongqing and beyond.\nLi Jie, Vice Director of Liangjiang New Area, said that the area serves as the primary hub for developing Chongqing's electronic information industry. It is accelerating the promotion of industrial quality and efficiency, focusing on new-type displays, integrated circuits, and intelligent terminals.\n\"Chongqing is a vital base for the BOE display industry. Since collaborating with Hoya in 2011, both companies have made rapid progress in their respective fields,\" said Cheng Gang, Vice President of BOE Technology Group. \"The establishment of Chongqing MasTek Electronics Co., Ltd. plays a significant role in promoting the stability of display industry chains in China and beyond,\" he added.\nIt is worth noting that photomasks are essential components in the process of producing display panels, with their precision and quality directly affecting the yield rate. The project aims to begin mass production in the fourth quarter of 2024, boasting an annual capacity of approximately 2,250 photomask products valued at 700 million yuan.\nThe electronic information industry is the pillar of Liangjiang New Area.
