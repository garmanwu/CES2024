        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Samsung Reveals Hybrid SSD With Both PCIe 4 and PCIe 5 Interfaces\nSamsung has inadvertently revealed an upcoming SSD dubbed the 990 EVO. Previously, there was just a Pro model, which uses a PCIe 4.0 interface, and the company has yet to announce a next-generation PCIe 5.0 device. This new drive features the older PCIe 4.0 and PCIe 5.0 interfaces, allowing it to be used on older and newer systems. The link to the SSD's product page link has been removed following its outing by news outlets, but clearly, Samsung has something interesting up its sleeve here.\nSadly, the 990 EVO is a midrange drive, so anyone hoping to max out a PCIe 5.0 connection at 14GB/s will be sorely disappointed. Instead, the drive will offer a maximum transfer rate of 5GB/s and 4.2GB/s for sequential reads and writes, according to Tom's Hardware, which linked to the German site Winfuture that found the now-deleted listing on Samsung's Ukrainian website. The product page shows a \"990 EVO\" in the search filter, where you can sort by drive model, but selecting it reveals the page has been removed\u2014oops. The EVO drive features four PCIe 4.0 lanes and two PCIe 5.0 lanes, as both configurations are equal in bandwidth at 8GB/s.\nThough the drive is a technological curiosity, it remains to be seen who would buy it over a dedicated PCIe 4.0 or 5.0 SSD, as it splits the difference between the two interfaces and doesn't max out either. For example, a PCIe 4.0 drive can theoretically hit about 7GB/s of throughput, whereas a PCIe 5.0 drive can double that at 14GB/s, so the 990 EVO isn't fully taxing either interface. This just begs the question of who would find this a suitable option for their current machine.\nWe suppose there could be people out there who want a future-proof SSD, and in that scenario, the drive does make sense. PCIe 4.0 is quite mature right now, and PCIe 5.0 drives are here, but most motherboards don't support it yet. There are also zero PCIe 5.0 interfaces on laptops, but those will probably arrive this year, along with motherboards supporting this interface. We suppose you could theoretically use this drive now on your PCIe 4.0 system, then swap it into a newer build later this year.\nThe EVO line from Samsung is its affordable lineup, so compromises are expected. As Tom's Hardware notes, the company hasn't released a new EVO drive in a few years, with the last one being the 970 Plus EVO on the PCIe 3.0 interface, so it's been a while. It remains to be seen when this drive will come to market and at what capacities and prices, but because a product page exists, it shouldn't be too long now.\nTagged In\nMore from Computing\nExtremeTech supports Group Black and its mission to increase greater diversity in media voices and media ownerships.\n\u00a9 2001-2024 Ziff Davis, LLC., a Ziff Davis company.

        "raw_content": "Empowering display industry professionals with cutting-edge insights and analysis\nSamsung\u2019s Ultimate CES 2024 Pitch: We Know Semiconductor Display Tech Better Than Anybody\nAt CES 2024, Samsung introduced a series of innovative technologies, aligning with their \u201cAI for All\u201d vision, whatever that meant. If you wanted a marketing job at CES, apparently the first question they ask you is, what are your favorite letters of the alphabet?\n\u201cHmm, A and I, I think.\u201d\n\u201cYou got the job, congratulations!\u201d\nIt\u2019s a shame that Samsung didn\u2019t choose to make it all about the Displays for All. Because the standout for Samsung at CES 2024 was its showing of a world first transparent MicroLED. There was a robot dog, Braille, an updated version of a previous model that I knew nothing about and didn\u2019t really care much about. And some sort of chatbot called Gauss, a soundbar, some appliances, and more interestingly, a new service called Now+. This service adds smart home controls to Samsung TVs. With Now+, you can control lights, air conditioners, and other devices from your TV. You can also use your phone as a TV remote. Another feature, Daily+, customizes your TV based on information from your SmartThings devices.\nSamsung TVs can now detect smartphones nearby and use them as remotes. A new SmartThings TV Quick Panel will appear for easy control of devices, viewing cameras, and finding your phone. The TV can also turn on automatically as you approach and show important information about your smart home devices, like camera feeds, temperature, and laundry cycle status. Samsung didn\u2019t provide much detail about when these features will be available, which TVs and devices are compatible, and if you need a Samsung smartphone for the remote control feature. They did mention that SmartThings is compatible with the Matter standard, meaning many connected appliances should work with it. But I guess you could call all of Now+ display related, too.\nI don\u2019t think Samsung was giving away any trade secrets or delivering a kick-ass plan for 2024 success, but what it was sending out a message, one that was pretty much a flex of muscle and power. There\u2019s no other way to explain the extent of the technological display that it put forward. It\u2019s hard to think that any of the MicroLED products shown are feasibly 2024 or 2025 products but if they were meant to be demonstrations of power and reach, they hit the mark. It was pretty arrogant but in that way that a very big powerful corporation can be.\nCould it also be fear? There is always that to consider, the thought that Samsung is stomping its feet and puffing up its chest to say, Hey, we got this tech beat and will own it in a few years time. MicroLED, and semiconductor displays in general, are not existential threats to traditional glass display manufacturers, like Samsung, which has enormous investments in fabs to that effect.\nThe boss likes to give us these projected roadmaps on the deployment of MicroLED, and looking into the future, when we will start to see significant volumes, but it all seems artificial, a timeline to meet the investment criteria of traditional display manufacturers and their need to recoup their investment in factories that cost them billions and billions. In other words, are the major display manufacturers holding back our future display technologies.\nYou wouldn\u2019t have thought so looking at Samsung\u2019s booth but it also seemed like the company was saying, We\u2019ll tell you when its time for MicroLED and we\u2019ll tell you how it gets to the mass market. That\u2019s my takeaway from the Samsung booth. And yes, when I asked them for more information or help, they were not very nice to me instead choosing to just push the crowds through the booth in a very methodical manner. That doesn\u2019t bother me, but it did color my thoughts on what was really going on with the presentation.\nAI for All\nIn the spirit of fairness, Jong-Hee (JH) Han, Vice Chairman and CEO of Samsung\u2019s Device eXperience (DX) Division, did give a presentation, with other executives at CES 2024, and there were some highlights which should go on the record:\nI have to conclude by saying that Samsung had the big presence at this show and it had the biggest presence of all the display vendors. I wasn\u2019t being cynical when I said this was a shot across the bow of the industry, just realistic. The company was flexing and doing it well. You can almost see the double bicep pose on the podium (if you don\u2019t know what that is, just look up Arnold + double bicep pose or, better yet, ask AI).\nRelated Posts\nSamsung\u2019s Ultimate CES 2024 Pitch: We Know Semiconductor Display Tech Better Than Anybody\nEmory Kale\nScrona\u2019s EHD Printing Comes Together With Avantama\u2019s MicroLED Materials\nOmid Rahmat\nSelling TVs to Future Generations\nOmid Rahmat\nEnnostar Announces Sale of Zhunan MicroLED Plant for $21M\nEmory Kale\nJon Peddie Research4 St. Gabrielle Ct.Tiburon, California 94920\n415-435-9368\n\u00a9 2024 Jon Peddie Research\nAbout us | Privacy Policy | terms of service | contact"

Since the global economic crisis began, they have been applying lean management system policies to improve the internal business structure, improve the productivity and generate greater outcomes with limited resources. Such activities led to great outcomes in various perspectives such as enterprise advancement and productivity increase and so on, but also marked some poor records in digital functions and innovation leading to new values creation.\nVideo\nVideo\nWe have introduced Brity RPA and automated various work in order to realize public interests and improve administrative work efficiency, which resulted in replacement of around 30,000 hours of yearly work by RPA.\nCase Study\nCase Study\nSamsung SDS\u2019 Brity RPA reduces M/H and greatly improves work productivity by automating simple/repeated work that has been done by human.

        "raw_content": "XDA\nMonitors at CES 2024: An exciting OLED showcase and what it taught us about the year ahead in monitors\nBeautiful OLEDs and high-refresh rate panels as far as the eyes can see. Yup, that was CES 2024.\nKey Takeaways\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) never fails to deliver with its extravagant tech demos and far-out concepts that aren't going to happen anytime soon. This year was no different, with a typical tidal wave of over-the-top products, but much of what we saw at the CES 2024 show floor was exciting real tech coming into reach. Monitors were one of them, and having spent a few days reflecting on what we saw at the trade show, it's clear to me that 2024 will be an exciting year for monitors on the whole.\nWe saw many exciting monitors at CES this year, from relatively smaller and simple IPS panels to high-end OLEDs that take refresh rates to places they've never gone. The best thing about the monitors we saw at CES this year is they're all real products coming soon.\n1\n32-inch QD-OLED & WOLED 4K panels\nManufacturer\nModel\nSize (Inches)\nPanel type\nResolution\nRefresh rate\nAlienware\nAW3225QF\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nHP\nOMEN Transcend 32\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nASUS\nROG PG32UCDP\n32\nOLED\n3840X2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nASUS\nROG PG32UCDM\n32\nWOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)/ 1920x1080 (FHD)\nUp to 480Hz\nMSI\nMPG321URX\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nLG\nUltraGear 32GS95UE\n32\nWOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)/ 1920x1080 (FHD)\nUp to 480Hz\nSamsung\nOdyssey OLED G80SD\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nGigabyte\nAorus FO32U2P\n32\nOLED\n3840x2160 (4K)\n240Hz\nSamsung's QD-OLED panels are seen in huge numbers\n32-inch monitors were seen in huge numbers this year at CES 2024, and they all use either Samsung's QD-OLED or LG's upcoming WOLED panels. The Alienware AW3225QF stands out from the rest on this particular list as it's the only one sporting a curved panel with a subtle 1700R curvature. The rest of the QD-OLEDs are all fairly similar, and that list includes several options from the likes of MSI, ASUS, and more.\nHP's OMEN Transcend 32 signals the company's entry into the world of OLEDs. It uses the same Samsung QD-OLED panel currently in mass production and supports Dolby Vision HDR and HyperX-tuned audio. It features a USB-C port with 140W power, but there's no word on whether it'll come with a DisplayPort 2.1. You can turn to the Gigabyte Aorus FO32U2P for DisplayPort 2.1, as it's the only model announced so far with the official DP 2.1 support, complete with full UHBR20 bandwidth. In case you're wondering, the rest of the models support DisplayPort 1.4 with Display Stream Compression (DSC) to deliver 4K 240Hz output.\nThere's also the MSI MPG321URX and the Samsung Odyssey G80SD, which use the same panel technology and are completely flat. The MPG321URX features the company's OLED Care 2.0 to prevent screen burn-in, while the Samsung Odyssey G80SD's highlight is an anti-glare coating missing from other QD-OLED monitors from CES 2024. The ASUS ROG Swift PG32UCDM, which was shown at Gamescom last year, also made an appearance at the CES 2024, and it'll be sold alongside other ROG monitors as a QD-OLED option.\nLG's WOLED panel may be worth waiting for\nSome manufacturers have opted to use LG's WOLED (White OLED) panels, which are being manufactured later this year. Like Samsung's QD-OLED, this one also measures 32 inches in size and supports a 4K resolution and up to 240Hz refresh rate. The highlight of this panel is that it also offers the ability to switch the panel to a relatively lower 1080p resolution while boosting the refresh rate to a whopping 480Hz. This is thanks to a feature that LG uses, Dynamic Frequency and Resolution (DFR), which you'll see the display manufacturers pushing as dual-mode operation.\n\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\nThe ASUS ROG PG32UCDP made headlines at CES this year for this dual-mode operation, which can support 4K 240Hz and FHD 480Hz outputs. LG will have an UltraGear monitor variant of its own under the model name 32GS95UE. This particular monitor uses the WOLED panel with dual-mode support. Plus, the UltraGear model will also support things like 'Pixel Sound' technology for an improved audio experience with the speakers behind the panel.\nThe Alienware AW3225QF is already available to pick up in the U.S. market, and it'll be followed by the MSI MPG321URX in February. The rest of the QD-OLED monitors showcased last week at CES don't have an official release date yet, but they'll likely end up on the shelves during Q1 2024, as the panel is already said to be in mass production. Alienware and MSI have confirmed $1,200 price tags for their monitors, so expect the rest to be priced around the same price when they arrive later this year. There's no official word on the pricing or availability of these monitors that use LG's WOLED panels. Still, we expect them to land on the market sometime in Q3, depending on when the panels enter production.\nThe Dell Alienware AW3225QF is one of the first 32-inch QD-OLED gaming monitors to enter the market. It sports a 32-inch panel with support for up to 4K resolution and up to a 240Hz refresh rate.\n2\n27-inch OLED screens with up to 480Hz\nManufacturer\nModel\nSize (Inches)\nPanel type\nResolution\nRefresh rate\nASUS\nROG Swift PG27AQDP\n27\nWOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n480Hz\nAlienware\nAW2725DF\n27\nQD-OLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n360Hz\nSamsung\nOdyssey G60SD\n27\nQD-OLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n360Hz\nGigabyte\nAorus FO27Q3\n27\nQD-OLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n360Hz\nLG\nUltraGear 27GS95QE\n27\nWOLED\n2560x1440 (QHD)\n240Hz\nA more sensible option for most gamers\nWe also saw a bunch of 27-inch gaming monitors, both with QD-OLED and LG's WOLED panels at CES 2024. These monitors are solid options for those who don't want to splurge on a massive 32-inch panel for gaming. 27-inch is still a decent size for gaming monitors, and it particularly shines with 1440p resolution. A bunch of these 27-inch monitors were seen at CES, but the one that stands out the most is perhaps the ROG Swift PG27AQDP monitor. This was announced as the world's first 480Hz OLED gaming monitor, and it remains the only 27-inch option out there with such a high refresh rate on offer. Some other highlights of this particular monitor include 1300 nits of peak brightness, including a USB-C port and support for Extreme Low Motion Blur (ELMB), essentially just a fancy marketing term for black frame insertion (BFI).\nLG has also announced the new UltraGear 27GS95QE monitor as an upgrade to its existing 27GR95QE. This updated model uses its existing WOLED panel and supports up to 1440p resolution and 240Hz refresh rate. If you'd rather have a QD-OLED panel instead, then there's also the Dell Alienware AW2725DF. This monitor ditches LG's WOLED in favor of Samsung's QD-OLED. It tops out at 360Hz but is already available in the US market.\nThe Alienware AW2725DF is an excellent gaming monitor that supports QHD resolution and up to 360Hz refresh rate. It sports a 27-inch panel that supports Adaptive FreeSync and has VESA AdaptiveSync Display certification.\nMSI MPG27QRX is also a good option if you're looking at a 27-inch QD-OLED monitor for your setup. This MSI monitor uses the same panel as the Alienware AW2725DF but comes with a USB-Type-C with 90W output and MSI's Panel Care 2.0 feature set like its 32-inch siblings. Gigabyte's Aorus FO27Q3 is also a good option to look forward to if you are in the market for a high refresh-rate gaming monitor. It remains to be seen whether it'll get the same features and specifications as its 4K sibling, though. Samsung's Odyssey G60SD stands out a bit in the 27-inch lineup due to its added matte AG coating. The G60SD is a bit thin on the feature set compared to its 32-inch QD-OLED sibling, but you still get a solid screen for gaming.\nNone of the 27-inch monitors, except the Alienware AW2725DF, have an official release date or the associated pricing information just yet. Most of them will start shipping within the next few months, but the ROG monitor with LG's WOLED will arrive later this year.\n3\nLarge format Ultrawide monitors\nNew models with existing OLED panels\nManufacturer\nModel\nSize (Inches)\nPanel type\nResolution\nRefresh rate\nCurvature\nAcer\nPredator X34\n34\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nAcer\nPredator X39\n39\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nAcer\nPredator Z57\n57\nVA with Mini LED\n7680x2160\n120Hz\n1000R\nAcer\nPredator X34 V3\n34\nVA panel\n3440x1440\n180Hz\n1500R\nLG\nUltraGear 34GS95QE\n34\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nLG\nUltraGear 39GS95QE\n39\nWOLED\n3440x1440\n240Hz\n800R\nLG\nUltraGear 45GS95QE\n45\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nASUS\nROG Swift PG34WCDM\n34\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nASUS\nROG Swift PG39WCDM\n39\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nGigabyte\nAorus MO34WQC2\n34\nWOLED\n3440X1440\n240Hz\n800R\nSamsung\nOdyssey G95SD\n49\nQD-OLED\n5120x1440\n240Hz\n1800R\nDell\nUltrasharp U4025QW\n40\nIPS LCD\n5120x1440\n120Hz\nTBA\nDell\nUltrasharp U3425WE\n34\nIPS LCD\n3440x1440\n120Hz\nTBA\nThere were no major breakthroughs in the ultrawide monitor space, as almost all new monitors announced at CES 2024 are simple upgrades to the existing options that are out there. We'll see a bunch of new ultrawide monitors over the next couple of months on the market from the likes of Acer, LG, and Samsung, but it's worth highlighting that pretty much all of them use the same WOLED or QD-OLED panels on the existing monitors.\nThey're essentially just updated models of the existing monitors out there, so you'll see Odyssey G95SD as an upgrade to the existing Odyssey G95SC, the new UltraGear 45GS95QE, and more. The added features vary based on the monitor you pick up, but they largely include things like an added USB-C port, support for features like KVM, higher brightness, and more. We also spotted a few LCD ultrawide monitors at CES, some of which use a VA panel while others have an IPS LCD. You can expect to see most of these monitors in Q1 2024,\n4\nMonitors with G-Sync Pulsar coming later this year\nNvidia announced the new G-Sync Pulsar technology alongside its Super GPUs at CES. This technology allows you to use their ultra-low motion blur (ULMB) at the same time as the G-Sync variable refresh rate for smooth visuals. We've seen manufacturers like ASUS using this particular technology with ELMB, which has already been announced for ROG Swift models. Nvidia details its technology as a superior option to the existing solution in its blog post. It has implemented an algorithm that dynamically adjusts strobing patterns to varying render rates.\nSimply put, Nvidia is claiming a technology that ensures perfect sync between Adaptive Overdrive and backlight pulse with the screen's refresh cycle. Its technology, however, requires the use of a new type of panel, meaning it won't be made available to existing G-Sync monitor users via an update. You can only expect new G-Sync Pulsar-supported monitors to arrive later in the year, and we expect to learn more about them in the coming months.\nA massive year for OLED monitors\nLooking at all the OLED monitors dazzling at CES, it's safe to say that the gaming industry is gearing up for a significant shift to OLEDs. It's truly an exciting time to be in the market for a high-end gaming monitor, as we'll continue to see new monitors roll out on the market in the coming months. Even those who may not be tempted to pick one up right now will eventually end up with one of these as the prices go down and the technology improves. In the meantime, you can continue taking advantage of the monitors in the budget space, which is also expected to see better options throughout the year.\nXDA Newsletter\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nAn evergreen writer at XDA Developers serving up reviews, buying guides, deals, and more on laptops, PC hardware, and smartphones that you care about.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nSamsung TV lineup 2024: All the new QLED and OLED TVs announced at CES\nSamsung is going all-in on AI this 2024\nNo stranger to massive strides in upgrades, Samsung is taking its TV lineup to the next level for 2024. It all starts with the dual 8K Neo QLEDs that sport incredible specs, like an AI motion enhancer, AI upscaling, and brilliant contrast upgrades. The two models powering Samsung\u2019s 2024 8K Neo QLEDs will be the QN900D and QN800D, both of which will be the slimmest 8K TVs on the market.\nOn the OLED side, Samsung is already highlighting its 2024 lineup with incredible promise as being the first glare-free OLED TVs. The S95D takes up from its predecessor with some exciting enhancements, like an Infinity One design, a Slim One Connect box, and, as already mentioned, a glare-free OLED panel. The S90D will be getting a Neural Quantum Processor and Pantone Validation for the most vibrant 4K image in tandem with stunning colors.\nThe 4K QLEDs are also seeing several improvements, most notably in the form of heightened HDR support, anti-reflection, and slimmer designs. The QN85D and QN90D are sure to be exciting new entries through Motion Xcelerator, smart calibration, and enhanced Dolby Atmos support.\nAnd that\u2019s not all Samsung is bringing to CES 2024, as the firm has also introduced new lifestyle products, like an upgraded The Frame, new Premiere projectors, like the Premiere 8K, and a smaller Music Frame for audio junkies. Those in attendance can see the wonders of Samsung\u2019s next TV innovations at its booth #19608 in the Las Vegas Convention Hall.\nSamsung 2024 TVs: OLED lineup\nS95D\nThe S95D OLED, a refresh on last year\u2019s S95C OLED \u2013 which we gave a perfect score \u2013 takes an already well-crafted base and enhances it with a slew of upgrades. It and the lesser S90D will both be the first OLEDs on the market to sport a glare-free panel. The S95D OLED will have a 144Hz refresh rate, Dolby Atmos with a Top Speaker, FreeSync Premium Pro, and a 70W 4.2.2Ch OTS+ speaker.\nThe Slim One Connect Box will also keep the entertainment area as wire-free as can be. With its Infinity One Design, the S95D will also be incredibly thin and easy to set up.\nHere are the S95D OLED TV sizes Samsung has announced so far:\u00a077\", 65\", 55\"\nS90D\nWhile the S90D OLED might be a bit less exciting than the former, it still comes loaded with some awesome new internals, main among them being a Neural Quantum Processor 4K and a Dolby Atmos-certified speaker system. Additions like FreeSync Premium, Pantone Validation, and a 120Hz refresh rate make it a gamer\u2019s paradise, made all the better through its Motion Xcelerator Turbo Pro function that allows it 4K 144Hz VRR support.\nHere are the S90D OLED TV sizes Samsung has announced so far: 77\", 65\", 55\"\nSamsung 2024 TVs: Neo QLED (8K and 4K Mini LED)\nQN900D\nAt 8K resolution, Samsung\u2019s QN800D Neo QLED is certainly a looker. It leverages a wide range of premium features not found on any other models among Samsung\u2019s 2024 TV lineup, including AI Motion Enhancer Pro, an Infinity Screen, 240Hz VRR, Quantum Super Resolution Pro, and (of course) a Mystic Floating Stand.\nThe QN900D leverages the Neural Quantum Processor 8K Pro, which allows for some awesome AI enhancements, like fluid ball-tracking when watching sports or turning SD, HD, and 4K content into 8K video on the fly. An OTS Pro 90W 6.2.4Ch Dolby Atmos-certified speaker is also a major plus.\nHere are the QN900D QLED TV sizes Samsung has announced so far:\u00a098\", 85\", 75\", 65\"\nQN800D\nThe QN900D steals much of its thunder, but that shouldn\u2019t leave the QN800D Neo QLED out to dry. It sports most of the same features as its more premium brethren, but at a much smaller scale, gifting it similar properties like the AI Motion Enhancer and Quantum Super Resolution (minus the Pro).\nIt\u2019s set to be a stunning 8K 120Hz display with loads of potential, like 165Hz VRR and an Ultra Viewing Angle so you never miss what\u2019s on the screen. The QN800D will also be getting the Real Depth Enhancer Pro, which will be available on the QN90D model, as well.\nHere are the QN800D QLED TV sizes Samsung has announced so far:\u00a085\", 75\", 65\"\nQN90D\nBoth 4K QLEDs are getting a beefed up processor this year, with a ton of AI improvements. The QN90D Neo QLED won\u2019t be a stranger to said AI upgrades, like Real Depth Enhancer, Expert Calibration, and Motion Xcelerator Turbo Pro. It will come with a Dolby Atmos OTS+ 60W speaker for incredible audio support in tandem with an Anti Reflection screen, in line with Samsung\u2019s continued commitment to innovating on TV viewing angles.\nHere are the QN90D QLED TV sizes Samsung has announced so far:\u00a098\", 85\", 75\", 65\", 55\", 50\", 43\"\nQN85D\nThe QN85D Neo QLED is also getting the Neural Quantum Processor 4K chip for AI enhancements, like AI HDR remastering and Motion Xcelerator Turbo. An Eye Comfort Mode should make it a bit easier on the eyes where bright lights, flashing colors, and other harmful video effects can be remedied using AI. Built on a NeoSlim Design, the QN85D OLED will also be easy to position across the household, making it ideal for everything from the living room to the kitchen.\nHere are the QN900D QLED TV sizes Samsung has announced so far:\u00a085\", 75\", 65\", 55\"\nSamsung 2024 TVs: Lifestyle lineup\nThe Frame is getting an update in the form of better color validations, improved energy efficiency, and an accompanying application (both web and mobile-based) for streamlined art uploads. A new Art Mode Frequency, as Samsung calls it, will gift the TV a dynamic refresh rate, dropping it down to 60Hz to save monthly wattage where necessary. The addition of an app will also make it easier for users to find and upload their favorite art pieces to The Frame without having to search endlessly for the perfect image.\nTo go alongside it, Samsung has unveiled the Music Frame, which is a much smaller version of The Frame and is being billed as a pseudo subwoofer of sorts. Music can be played over WiFi with clear and crisp audio output from Music Frames that can be positioned on a wall or a surface. They will also support G Symphony for perfected soundscapes across the household.\nIf it didn\u2019t already have a ton of world\u2019s firsts with its 2024 TV lineup, Samsung does with the addition of its Premiere 8K, which the company is billing as not only the world\u2019s first 100W output Dolby Atmos projector but also the world\u2019s first 8K projector with wireless connectivity. It will support WiFi 7, LightWarp projection mapping, up to 120 screen size, and a GamingHub, so the gamers aren\u2019t left out of the fun.\nSamsung is also introducing a refreshed projector lineup, including The Premiere 7 and Premiere 9, as well as bringing to market a compact triple laser projector in the Premiere 5 series.\nSamsung 2024 TVs: Outlook\nWith no hands on data or information on availability, we\u2019ll just have to wait and see where Samsung\u2019s 2024 TV lineup stands in the entire market. Of clear importance is AI enhancements and how the tech can better improve our daily content watching, but whether they will be significant improvements or just marketing jargon remains to be seen.\nThose in attendance at CES can catch a glimpse of Samsung\u2019s 2024 TV lineup at the firm\u2019s booth #19608 in the Las Vegas Convention Hall.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nI saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 products impressed me\nThe innovations happening in the TV space are making content more immersive to consume than ever and the world's leading TV maker led the charge at CES 2024 with meaningful upgrades across its top devices, the launch of new product lines, and two first-in-the-world breakthroughs.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nI got to go eyes-on with everything Samsung unveiled in Las Vegas in its new lineup of TVs, computer monitors, and home entertainment devices and these are the four things I was most excited to share with you.\n1. S95D OLED TV's new \"glare-free\" matte finish\nOne of the simplest 2024 upgrades was also the most impressive to see in person. Samsung's new \"Glare Free OLED\" that it's bringing to the top-of-the-line S95D OLED makes this TV the best one to look at in the entire Samsung lineup. When you combine the beautiful contrast and vibrant color of Samsung's QD-OLED technology with the new matte finish, it produces a TV that is a pleasure to watch from any angle and in the brightest or darkest rooms.\nAlso: Samsung unveils 2024 TVs with AI features that you'd actually want to use\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nInstead of being a giant black mirror like most of today's TVs, the matte finish on the S95D disperses and softens the light from lamps and windows into a minimal glow that's overpowered by the brightness of Samsung's OLED display.\nMy buddy David Katzmaier from CNET did a test where he held up a phone with a completely white screen in front of the new matte S95D and then in front of last year's S95C. Last year's model was like a mirror reflecting back the shape of the phone, while the new glare-free model softened the light into a minimal round glow. ZDNET's Kerry Wan and I did a similar test using the flashlight from Kerry's phone -- with even more intense light -- and got a similarly pleasing result.\nWith the effectiveness of this new matte finish and Samsung's already-great QD OLED technology, I'm confident the S95D will be a top contender for best picture quality in the world among all TVs in 2024.\n2. The Premiere 8K projector\nSamsung announced the world's first 8K wireless ultra short throw projector, and I spent a good deal of time soaking it in at Samsung's First Look event at CES. In the demo area, it was projected onto a 150-inch ambient light rejection (ALR) screen that makes a projector's picture look like a regular TV with its thin black frame around the edge, and is also reminiscent of being at the movies because of the size of the picture and the glare reduction you get from ALR. The result was a very cinema-like experience, and even though projectors can never match the contrast and dynamic range of OLED or QLED, the vibrance of the picture quality was very strong.\nAlso: Xgimi's new IMAX Enhanced projector is an entertainment beast, but wait until you see 'Aladdin'\nFor this new generation of projectors that we're seeing from Samsung and its competitors, 8K makes a lot of sense because they are bringing 100-inch and larger TV displays to a lot more people. And at that size, the extra level of detail and sharpness you get with 8K starts to make a notable difference in picture quality.\nEven at 150 inches, the Premiere 8K projector only had to sit 12 inches from the wall to project an image that large. With its stylish wooden finish, it's also one of the best-designed ultra short throw projectors I've seen. That matters since it's a big rectangular box that often sits awkwardly in your living room. It also comes with a matching One Connect box that you can place somewhere else in the room because it's wireless -- so you don't have to run a bunch of HDMI cables to that awkwardly placed projector box.\n3. Music Frame\nBuilding on the success of The Frame TV -- which turns a TV into a classic work of art or a family photo album when you're not watching something -- Samsung unveiled a new product line at CES 2024: the Music Frame. This product can serve as a hidden speaker to improve the sound of your home cinema experience or offer a much more aesthetically pleasing kitchen speaker than an Amazon Echo or Apple HomePod.\nAlso: Samsung has its own line of video game controllers now. Here's the first model\nThis product masquerades as a standard picture frame and you can slip a photo or a piece of art into it. But it's very thick and has the look of a deep shadowbox, except that the photo or artwork is at the front, and it hides two sound woofers behind it at the back of the frame. You can use two Music Frames to create left and right speakers or a set of rear surround sound speakers that can pair with a Samsung soundbar and TV to create Q-Symphony intelligent surround sound.\nMusic Frame also has a similar frame style and colors to The Frame TV and could match nicely in a room where they were used together.\n4. Transparent Micro-LED display\nSamsung showed off the world's first transparent Micro-LED display and the demo was spectacular -- even if a little gimmicky for something that won't be a viable product for a while. On a slab of glass about an inch thick, the demo unit ran all kinds of flashy content from fireworks going off to vibrant paint splashing out of cans to sports infographics displaying on screen. The colors looked more intense and the display more transparent than competing transparent OLED screens from LG, which have been around for a few years.\nAlso: I saw Samsung and LG's new transparent TVs at CES, and there's a clear winner\nThat makes sense since Micro-LED is the display technology that will likely supersede OLED one day for the highest quality TVs. Samsung has been working for years on Micro-LED, which is best known for its place in The Wall, the absolutely massive and exorbitantly priced TV system that is mostly used in commercial installations like stadiums, car showrooms, large corporate conference rooms, and retail experiences, for example.\nSo why would anyone want a transparent TV or display screen? In the home, it would probably be little more than a virtual fish tank or perhaps a place to show the family calendar, leave messages, and play a slideshow of family photos. Perhaps that will make sense a decade from now when these displays are manufactured at low cost. But today, like The Wall, it will likely be limited to uses like high-end luxury boxes in stadiums where the glass to watch the game can also light up with player information, data points from the game, ads, and notifications. When it gets far cheaper, it could eventually be used to replace glass in public spaces such as bus stops and train stations to show the schedule and live updates.\nRelated\nSamsung's S95D OLED is the best TV of CES 2024 and best in the world right now\nThe best TVs of CES 2024\nThe best TVs for 2024: Expert tested and reviewed"
