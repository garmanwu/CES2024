This is VanJee\u2019s first overseas exhibition this year, bringing a variety of LiDAR production in the vehicle, road side, and industrial fields. In terms of vehicle LiDAR, VanJee Technology exhibited the fusion solutions of 128-layer main LiDAR+Pure solid state blind spot OPA-LiDAR. Among them, WLR-739 128-layer main LiDAR is officially promoted to international vehicle manufacturers after the release of domestic products.\nWith new masterpieces, VanJee Technology shows technical confidence in on -site interaction.\nAt the booth site, VanJee Technology established a set of 128 -line laser radar interactive experience zone. It simulates vehicles for real -time detection of past pedestrians, and shows the point cloud interface. Visitors can directly feel the 128 -layer LiDAR\u2019s super long -range detection capabilities, densely scanning accuracy, and excellent anti -interference capabilities. It shows the global public display, which fully reflects the high confidence of VanJee Technology's dedication and performance. During this period, it received the key attention and affirmation of professional customers, technical experts, and industry media.\nVanJee Vehicle LiDAR WLR-739 uses 905nm light source. It has an angular resolution of 0.1 \u00b0*0.2 \u00b0, which exceeds 150W per second to meet the high -precision detection requirements. The detection distance of 10%standard reflectance can reach 150 meters and the farthest detection distance can reach 200 meters. It meets the requirements of high -speed targets in high -speed scene detection of ultra -long -distance targets, leaving sufficient reaction time for ADAS to ensure driving safety.\nIn the past three years, through the in -depth layout of automotive electronic products, VanJee Technology has become a first -level supplier of more than 60 main vehicle manufacturers in the world. With much joint development experience in terms of LiDAR product development system, VanJee runs through the product design, R & D, testing, production, and process full process, and the full -chain -to -vehicle regulations for quality standards to meet the market's performance and stability of LiDAR requirements. Regarding the global promotion of WLR-739, VanJee Technology will first provide LiDAR trials and tests to long-term cooperative companies.\nIn terms of delivery guarantee, VanJee Technology has a global manufacturing base of more than 42,000 square meters. Among them, the inspection center passed CNAS certification in 2017, covering the field of automotive electronics and other fields. It has more than hundreds of testing projects. At present, WLR-739 has completed the related tests of DV experiments. The manufacturing base is also equipped with a 10,000 -level dust -free workshop and an advanced automated production line. The annual production capacity of the vehicle LiDAR is 300,000 units.\nEmpower industrial automation and light up the new ecology\nVanJee Technology has more than 10 years of LiDAR product development experience. The products are widely used in smart transportation and industrial service, robot navigation obstacle avoidance and driving scenarios.\nAmong them, 716 mini is a SLAM navigation lidar, which takes into account the dual advantage of high accuracy and small volume. Its accuracy of 20mm, 25M ranging capacity, is suitable for navigation of industrial logistics robots such as cleaning and disinfecting commercial service robots and AGV.\n718mini is an obstacle -free lidar that can provide a 270 \u00b0 scanning angle and a 25 -meter protection distance. It can provide reliable anti -collision support for mobile devices such as AGV/ AMR/ laser forklift and heavy port machines.\nIn this exhibition, VanJee Technology and LiDAR's full series of products have received widespread attention and recognition from the international market relying on rich practical experience and forward -looking layouts. It shows the global hardcore product power, showing the company's technical self -confidence Essence In the future. VanJee Technology will continue to inject new impetus into the development of the laser radar industry, technological innovation, and expanding application scenarios, enhance the degree of industrial automation, and help the development of the autonomous driving industry.\nThe Spectacular Moments of VanJee LiDAR at CES Exhibition\nJan 24,2024\nVanJee Technology Shines at the 2023 ITS World Congress | Technological Innovation Boosts Global Smart Transportation Development\nDec 15,2023\nSuccessful Delivery!
