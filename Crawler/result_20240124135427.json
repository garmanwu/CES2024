The series also raises awareness of our unpredictable future, emphasizing the importance of creating a preparedness posture that reduces operational risk, enhances decision-making, and boosts mission effectiveness.\n\u201cBy asking how we hedge against a future that no one can fully predict\nand how we can take the necessary risks, S&T\u2019s Preparedness Series serves as a guide\nfor impactful research and technology investments that prepare the Department\nand country for over-the-horizon challenges and opportunities.\u201d\n\u2014Dimitri Kusnezov, Under Secretary for Science and Technology\nInnovation, Research and Development (IRD)\nAbout: DHS is preparing for the future by identifying eight Strategic Priority Research Areas (SPRA) that will focus our Innovation, Research, and Development (IRD) investments through FY30.\u00a0 These SPRAs are critical to ensuring our front-line operators have the tools they need to stay ahead of our adversaries and better prepare for and respond to natural hazards.\nSilicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP)\nAbout: The Silicon Valley Innovation Program (SVIP) bridges the technology development gap between DHS S&T, startups and small businesses, and DHS operational components. Through SVIP, startups and other small technology businesses can access non-dilutive funding, guidance from subject matter experts, direct access to operational end-users during prototype testing, and a legacy federal partnership to draw in future investors, providing a unique experience and resource in the development of viable technologies.\nLearn More About the SVIP Startups\nFlux Tensor\nComputer Vision | Securing Soft Targets\nmyLanguage\nLanguage Translation | Language Translator\nmyLanguage is a mobile language translation company developing technology that enables people to have a fluent spoken conversation with someone who speaks a different language without requiring an Internet connection. They are currently working to enable USCG personnel to communicate in real time rapidly and effectively with non-English speakers and those who are unable to communicate verbally. Off-line capability is necessary because many USCG interactions where translation devices are required are far out at sea, in extreme environmental conditions, and in locations without cell service or Internet connections.\nVigiLife\nHealthTech | Human Performance & Resiliency\nVigiLife is a startup focused on preventing injuries for workers, first responders and the military using technology. Their arm-worn wearable provides real-time alerting and historical trend analysis, which allows safety professionals to identify operational inefficiencies and allow for timely intervention. They are currently working with DHS on a solution that will involve wearable devices and AI-enabled applications for data collection and analysis to impact active monitoring of personnel in extreme environments.\nSmall Business Innovation Research Program (SBIR)\nAbout: The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program is one of the largest public\u2013private partnerships in the United States. The SBIR program encourages U.S. small businesses with fewer than 500 employees to provide quality research and to develop new processes, products and technologies in support of the missions of the U.S. government.\u00a0Administered by DHS S&T, the\u00a0DHS SBIR Program\u00a0supports a full spectrum of SBIR initiatives serving all components.\nLearn More About the SBIR Companies\nStay tuned for more information!\nScreening at Speed Program\nAbout: The S&T Screening at Speed Program pursues transformative research and development focused on delivering the checkpoint of the future to the Transportation Security Administration. The program is developing technologies to increase security effectiveness from curb to gate, while dramatically reducing wait times, improving the passenger experience, and lowering update costs to address emerging threats. One of the program\u2019s current development efforts is a self-service screening checkpoint for PreCheck\u00ae passengers that offers an enhanced checkpoint experience that allows passenger to complete the screening process with minimal to no security officer assistance.\nNote: The Screening at Speed program demonstration conducted in the S&T exhibit booth at CES 2024 is a separate concept design from the pilot that the program will be conducting at the Harry Reid International Airport later in 2024.\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security"

Conducted in partnership with the venture-building company FedTech, HSSS pairs the next generation of entrepreneurs with federally-funded, cutting-edge technologies to help move them from the lab to the market.\nRecruiting for the 2024 Cohort is Closed\nThe next HSSS cohort will run from January 2024 through May 2024. Entrepreneur participants are expected to devote ~20 hours a week (weekends and evenings) to the program. All teams take part in the first phase of the program, and some may progress to Phase II, based on a competitive process. The 2024 cohort is no longer accepting applications.\nHow does the HSSS program work?\nFedTech forms teams of entrepreneurs and matches them with promising federally-funded technologies to assess their commercialization potential. Each team has two or three budding entrepreneurs who bring diverse expertise in technology, engineering, and business. The FedTech curriculum provides teams with entrepreneurial training and experiential learning with coaches and mentors.\nPhase I\nDuring phase I, program entrepreneurs are taught foundational basics and skill sets so teams can quickly assess potential use cases for their matched technology. During weekly breakout sessions, teams will practice pitching for mentors who will act as sounding boards. Entrepreneurs will participate in lectures on lean programming and spinout topics such as: fundraising, intellectual property, business models, and customer outreach. Participants also engage in customer discovery interviews to help identify the problem-solution fit for their technology.\nPhase II\nPhase II participants will set up early-stage companies with pragmatic and ambitious company goals. Entrepreneur teams will be guided by program mentors on how to navigate crucial formation steps from pitching to licensing their technologies. The content of this phase will be customized for the team.\nWho are we looking for?\nHSSS is looking for diverse applicants who are ready to continue their entrepreneurship journey or take a step into the world of entrepreneurship. Most prior participants have been employed full-time over the course of this program but must be willing and able to commit to the workshops, team meetings and mentorship sessions of this program, which typically occur during the week on evenings and occasional weekends.\nTechnologists:\u00a0A competitive technical applicant has deep technical experience in a technology vertical(s). Although not required, a relevant PhD is generally a plus for deep tech startups along with 5+ years of industry experience. This role is for a future chief technology officer or vice president of research and development.\nBusiness Experts:\u00a0A competitive business applicant (non-technical) typically has experience in the business aspects of the vertical (i.e., business development, operations, marketing, fundraising, strategy). Although not required, an MBA or prior operating experience in a startup is preferred, along with 5+ years of experience. This role is for a future CEO, COO, CMO, or VP of Sales.\nCareer Shifters, Veterans, & Re-Entrants to the Workforce:\u00a0Individuals who are looking to step out and explore new career pathways are encouraged to apply for the Startup Studio Program.\nIndividuals or teams are welcome to apply.\n2023 Cohort\nIn July 2023, HSSS hosted its third annual and first in-person Converge in Arlington, VA, the culminating event of the 16-week program. Eight teams pitched their efforts to commercialize groundbreaking technologies sourced from U.S. laboratories and universities to a hybrid audience and an expert panel of judges. Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Director Jen Easterly provided a keynote addressing the HSSS entrepreneurs. View the Converge 2023 recording on YouTube.\nThe judges chose NAS-LIION as the Converge 2023 Winner. The team\u2019s battery leak detection technology uses a colorimetric indicator to detect electrolyte leakage from Lithium-Ion batteries. The Audience Choice award went to Full Spectrum Imaging (FSI), an improved resolution imaging technology from S&T\u2019s Transportation Security Laboratory. FSI's Randomized Precious-Metal Attenuation Filter (RPAF) is a simple after-market attachment used with any X-ray or Computed Tomography system, enabling full color (energy spectrum) pictures.\nPast Cohorts\n2022 Cohort\nSeven teams completed the 2022 Cohort by participating in Converge, the culminating event hosted by S&T and FedTech in July 2022. View Converge on YouTube to watch the teams in action and hear opening remarks from Julie Brewer, Executive Director of S&T\u2019s Office of Innovation and Collaboration. \u00a0Seven teams pitched their early-stage companies and technologies to a public audience and a panel of judges, highlighting market opportunities and plans for further development and growth.\nThe judges selected two winners of Converge \u201922, HorizonAI and Aether. HorizonAI worked with a technology sourced from the DHS Federally Funded R&D Center HSSEDI and Aether worked with a Naval Research Laboratory technology. HorizonAI pitched the ROSIE technology, which uses an optical sensor to safely collect accurate, automated, continuous, and real-time vitals data and is effective on masked individuals and groups. Aether pitched a sensor technology that can \u201csee\u201d chemical threats and provides a higher level of selectivity and specificity than its predecessors.\nAdditional program information and outcomes can be found in the 2022 Cohort Report.\n2021 Cohort\nIn the inaugural HSSS \u201821 cohort, FedTech assessed over 450 technologies from federal labs and academia to identify 10 commercially-promising technologies that align with homeland security missions. From there, 30 entrepreneurs were selected to participate in the two-phased program. In Phase I, 10 teams learned foundational entrepreneurial knowledge and skillsets to quickly assess potential use cases for their matched technologies.\u00a0Phase I concluded with an internal pitch day that resulted in six teams progressing into Phase II, where they focused on forming early-stage companies to commercialize their technologies.\nFeaturing a broad array of distinguished experts across various fields (81% of whom were women or people of color), five teams capped off Phase II by pitching their technologies to venture capitalists, homeland security experts, and other innovators at the HSSS \u201921 Converge event. With technologies ranging from network security and machine learning to nighttime facial recognition alert systems, each team had 6 minutes to present their progress in forming a company and licensing their technology.\nWatch the Converge Event on YouTube to see the teams in action plus keynote remarks by the SOPDUSST.\u00a0Detailed program information and outcomes can be reviewed in the\u00a02021 Cohort report.\nhttps://www.dhs.gov/science-and-technology\nAn official website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security"

This event features a panel of experts, successful entrepreneurs from the HSSS 2021 cohort, and a live Q&A with DHS S&T and FedTech to discuss the program.\u00a0Click\u00a0here\u00a0to register.\nHow does the HSSS program work?\nFedTech forms teams of entrepreneurs and matches them with promising federally funded technologies to assess their commercialization potential. Each team has two or three budding entrepreneurs who bring diverse expertise in technology, engineering, and business. The FedTech curriculum provides teams with entrepreneurial training and experiential learning with coaches and mentors.\n2022 Cohort\nThe next HSSS will run from January 2022 to July 2022. Entrepreneur participants are expected to devote ~20 hours a week (weekends and evenings) to the program. All teams take part in the first phase of the program, and some may progress to Phase II, based on a competitive process.\nDuring phase I, program entrepreneurs are taught foundational basics and skill sets so teams can quickly assess potential use cases for their matched technology. During weekly breakout sessions, teams will practice pitching for mentors who will act as sounding boards. Entrepreneurs will participate in lectures on lean programming and spinout topics such as: fundraising, intellectual property, business models, and customer outreach. Participants also engage in customer discovery interviews to help identify the problem-solution fit for their technology.\nPhase II participants will set up early-stage companies with pragmatic and ambitious company goals. Entrepreneur teams will be guided by program mentors on how to navigate crucial formation steps from pitching to licensing their technologies. The content of this phase will be customized for the team.\nWho are we looking for?\nHSSS is looking for diverse applicants who are ready to continue their entrepreneurship journey or take a step into the world of entrepreneurship. Most prior participants have been employed full-time over the course of this program but must be willing and able to commit to the workshops, team meetings and mentorship sessions of this program, which typically occur during the week on evenings and occasional weekends.\nTechnologists:\u00a0A competitive technical applicant has deep technical experience in a technology vertical(s). Although not required, a relevant PhD is generally a plus for deep tech startups along with 5+ years of industry experience. This role is for a future chief technology officer or vice president of research and development.\nBusiness Experts:\u00a0A competitive business applicant (non-technical) typically has experience in the business aspects of the vertical (i.e., business development, operations, marketing, fundraising, strategy). Although not required, an MBA or prior operating experience in a startup is preferred, along with 5+ years of experience. This role is for a future CEO, COO, CMO, or VP of Sales.\nCareer Shifters, Veterans, & Re-Entrants to the Workforce:\u00a0Individuals who are looking to step out and explore new career pathways are encouraged to apply for the Startup Studio Program.\nIndividuals or teams are welcome to apply.\nNow Accepting Applications for the 2022 Homeland Security Startup Studio\nThe first step of the application process is to submit an\u00a0application form (hsforms.com), after which FedTech will invite applicants to complete a video interview. Once written and video applications have been reviewed (approximately two to three weeks after submission), applicants will receive an email confirmation about progression to the next stage of the process.\u00a0At this stage, more specific information about the program, dates, and logistics will be shared with applicants. Each cohort has its own set of unique curated technologies.\nFirst-round interviews will occur shortly after receipt of applications, and the technology-specific final interview will take place approximately one month before the start of the program. \u00a0The graphic below illustrates the recruitment process.\nA Look Back at the 2021 Cohort\nIn the\u00a0inaugural HSSS \u201821 cohort, FedTech assessed over 450 technologies from federal labs and academia to identify 10 commercially promising technologies that align with homeland security missions. From there, 30 entrepreneurs were selected to participate in the two-phased program.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

security authorizations for Cloud Service Offerings.\nInformation for Our Partners\nCloud Service Providers\nProvide your Cloud Service Offering to the federal government\nFederal Agencies\nAdopt innovative cloud services to meet your agency\u2019s mission needs\nAssessors\nAct as a third party to perform initial and periodic security assessments\nFedRAMP Authorization Process\nThere are two ways to authorize a Cloud Service Offering (CSO) through FedRAMP, through an individual agency or the Joint Authorization Board (JAB).\nReadiness Assessment\nPre-Authorization\nFull Security Assessment\nAgency Authorization Process\nFedRAMP Connect\nReadiness Assessment\nFull Security Assessment\nJAB Authorization Process\nThe first step of the process is for a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) to select an authorization approach. There are two approaches to obtaining \u201cFedRAMP Authorized\u201d status on the FedRAMP Marketplace. Interested parties can apply either through the Joint Authorization Board or through a federal agency.\nThe next phase is preparation. The first step in the agency path is Partnership Establishment and the second is Readiness Assessment. Within the JAB path, Preparation includes the steps FedRAMP Connect and the Readiness Assessment.\nThe next phase is Authorization. The authorization phase looks different for both agency and JAB, however the overarching steps remain the same, starting with a full security assessment and finishing with an authorization process. Once the authorization process is complete, a CSP must engage in continuous monitoring to ensure that the risk accepted at the time of authorization remains acceptable. The JAB Provisional-Authority To Operate (P-ATO) signifies all three JAB Agencies reviewed the security package and deemed the risk acceptable for the federal community. In turn, Agencies review the JAB P-ATO and the associated security package and clear it for their Agencies\u2019 use. In doing so, the agency issues their own authorization to use the product. Additionally, the JAB will conduct continuous monitoring for systems that have earned a P-ATO.\nNote: Readiness Assessment is required for the JAB Process and is optional but highly recommended for the Agency Process.\nFedRAMP at a Glance\nReady\n28\nIn Process\n53\nAuthorized\n211\nThe Federal Risk and Authorization Management Program (FedRAMP\u00ae) is managed by the FedRAMP Program Management Office.\nThe FedRAMP name and the FedRAMP logo are the property of the General Services Administration (GSA) and may not be used without GSA\u2019s express, written permission.

        "raw_content": "Inside-Out Phones, Folding TVs: Behold The Eye-Popping Tech of CES 2024\nThe world's largest consumer tech show is a showcase of incredible innovation, and this is the cream of the crop.\nWe got an eyeful of a 137-inch TV that folds and unfolds, here at CES 2024.\nCES 2024\u00a0is full of innovative delights,\u00a0futuristic concepts, practical products you can\u00a0preorder or buy today\u00a0and some of the\u00a0strangest tech to stumble across our paths. Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives.\nAs we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of\u00a0ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies,\u00a0new car tech, gaming gear and robots\u00a0-- there's even a robot for your dog.\nHere's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.\nRead more: \u00a0The Best of Show at CES 2024.\nAR/VR glasses that fit in one room\nApple may have stolen the show in absentia announcing that the Vision Pro would be available next month, but the headset is still insanely expensive at $3,500. While it's yet to be seen whether\u00a0AR/VR technology will take off, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, including the intriguing-looking Xreal Air 2 Ultra ($699). The Xreal is a lot more compact than the Apple behemoth, the price is relatively competitive and CNET's Lisa Eadiciccio was impressed by its image quality. However, she says the headset still needs to be tethered to another device, and it'll need third-party developers if it's to have a chance against Apple or even Google.\nA portable, add-on OLED display that folds\nSecondary displays are a productivity godsend, enabling the kind of multitasking that isn't possible even with the widest monitors. While portable solutions are available, the best solutions tend to be tethered to your desk. Maker Asus says the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH is the first portable OLED display -- and as the name suggests, it also folds! With the superior image quality of OLED, this 17.3-incher should be great for on-the-go movies or gaming, when it hits later in 2024.\nHitch a ride on a flying EV taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the debut of the Supernal S-A2.\nBanish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design\u00a0and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter. As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.\nThe future is electric\nHonda promises that the Saloon will match \"the joy of driving\" with steer-by-wire technology.\nAs we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle that could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the \"board room on wheels\" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs!\nThe most impressive, and most-likely concept to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing \"steer-by-wire\" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new \"floating H\" logo.\nFoldable phones? How about a foldable TV?\nThe C Seed N1, unfolded.\nWhat to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch C Seed N1 showed off at CES 2024.\nThe custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture,\nand its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk\nin about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV.\nOh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nSteam Deck has a new challenger\nMSI's new game handheld runs Windows but has Intel inside.\nAfter years of near misses such as the Steam Machine, the Steam Deck was an unexpected success for Valve, and the console is the current standard for mobile PC gaming. While the competing\u00a0Asus ROG Ally looked cool, using Windows on it was apparently pretty clunky. Now that situation might change with the help of Intel -- the company has a lot of experience making Windows machines. MSI's Claw handheld obviously owes a debt to the Steam Deck, but it has Intel's new Meteor Lake chips onboard instead of AMD chips. CNET's Scott Stein says this development means more manufacturers will have the opportunity to design their own Steam Deck-alikes that can also run Windows.\nWhat's old is new\nIf\nyou consider yourself an old-school smartphone user, you may yearn for\nthe physical keyboards that used to be a mainstay of the phones of\nyesteryear. The iPhone's on-screen keyboard ushered out the full\nphysical keyboards that were popular on\u00a0BlackBerry\u00a0devices.\nThe Clicks keyboard,\nfrom Clicks Technology, will transform your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15\nPro and Pro Max, adding a keyboard that's actually integrated into a\nwraparound case. This $139 wraparound slides onto your device and runs\noff the phone's battery, so no charging required. Be sure to check out our hands-on review.\nThis phone bends over backward for you\nAs phones with screens that fold in half get more consumer attention, Samsung appears to be poised to flip the market again. The electronics giant showcased a concept handset at\u00a0CES 2024 called the Flex In & Out Flip that can fold in both directions and completely backward, allowing you to use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nWhen bent backward, one side is slightly shorter than the other, to avoid covering the camera, while the larger side was big enough to show several icons in the phone's quick settings menu, media playback controls and the time and battery level. Although the handset is only a concept design right now, CNET's Lisa Eadicicco points out that it might offer a hint at the future of devices that roll, flex, bend, fold and otherwise contort to adapt tech to our unique needs.\nGet to work with this gaming laptop\nMore and more, we're asking our laptops to do double duty. In addition to strong gaming performance, we want to be able to use these thinner, lightweight devices for work or school. The HP Omen Transcend 14, which made its debut at CES 2024, is light enough for a daily commute but sports a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display with a 48-120Hz variable refresh rate backed up by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070.\nThe 14-inch laptop weighs only 3.6 pounds (1.6 kilograms) -- light for a gaming laptop and has battery life good for up to 11.5 hours with the integrated graphics and an Eco mode. The new 14-inch size starts at $1,500. A 16-inch version will also be available with the option for a 4K 240Hz OLED starting at $1,900.\nThis thermometer also checks your heart and lungs\nIf you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer,\nelectrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was\nunveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you \"beam it,\" the device can give you clues about your health.\nThe device, which Withings describes as being \"portable and smaller than a smartphone,\"\ncombines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of\nthe wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like\nblood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used\nas a \"digital stethoscope.\"\nFollowing expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nForget a projector, get a huge TCL instead\nThe TCL 115QM891G is a 115-inch TV that's 8.5 feet wide and around 6 feet tall on its stand.\nCNET's projector reviewer Geoff Morrison has been extolling the benefits of projectors for many years, but even he has come around to technologies like OLED and Mini-LED of late. What would he think of the new TCL 115QM891G? This is a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's up to five times brighter than most TVs, and with better blacks too, according to TV reviewer David Katzmaier.\nAs TV reviewers ourselves we've seen large TVs, but in the old days they were stuck at HD. The pixels on Panasonic's\u00a0103-inch 1080p, for instance, were huge and easily noticeable. This is why 4K technology is so great -- it means you can install a TV as big as a wall, and not see black lines between the pixels. The TCL is also going to be a lot cheaper than that $100,000 Panasonic too, at under $20,000.\nStained glass gets a new lease on lifelong power\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nSolar panels are great -- they produce electricity from one of the most abundant resources we have, and they pay for themselves in quick order -- but no one has ever called them pretty. Fear not! Japanese company inQs has worked out a way to make solar cells out of colored glass. The company is exhibiting a number of objects at CES 2024, including a\u00a0stained glass pane that generates electricity. The devices are small, and one was able to power only a desk fan, but we like how they point to a rethink of how solar panels should look and work.\nDisguising weird-looking things has been a perpetual trend at CES, as with LG's ArtCool air conditioners. And this year the Samsung Music Frame lets you put art inside a smart speaker.\nHey, Ida, which is better: Alexa or Siri?\nAI is already everywhere here at CES 2024 -- and adding to the list of products it'll be appearing in is cars. Volkswagen has announced a deal with ChatGPT that\u00a0enables users to ask all sorts of questions of their car, in the same way they would of a traditional digital assistant. At the moment, VW's voice assistant lets users say, \"Hey, Ida,\" to ask a question about something basic, like requesting tire pressure. But the automaker's cars are incapable of answering more advanced questions like, \"When did the New York Jets last win the Super Bowl?\" Under the new deal, if the car's assistant can't answer the question, it'll hand off the query to ChatGPT. (Yes, the Jets did win one. But it was a very, very long time ago.)\nIt's worth noting that competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri have been completing these queries natively for many years, so teaming with ChatGPT is an easier way for VW's Ida to catch up.\nMust-see-through TV\nThis transparent display, currently showing fish, can transform into a 77-inch TV.\nTVs are getting bigger every year, which means there's a bigger slab of black plastic taking up a significant portion of the living room wall when it's not in use. But what if we could make it disappear, without actually pulling it off the wall?\nLG has apparently done just that with a\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0that converts from a \"fish tank\" to a 77-inch television (pictured above). Unlike Samsung's competing technology this will apparently be a real product, shipping later in 2024.\nMeanwhile Samsung is showing off the first transparent version of its\u00a0Micro-LED display tech\u00a0at\u00a0CES 2024. While transparent OLED and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, Samsung says its Micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the current tech. But Samsung says its transparent Micro-LED tech isn't available in the market, so what Katzmaier saw (or didn't see?) is essentially a concept.\nA 2-minute ice cream maker\nWe scream for ice cream.\nComing soon to a restaurant near you: freshly made ice cream, ready from start to finish in just 2 minutes.\nWe've loved trying the vanilla ice cream churned out by the speedy ColdSnap -- first in 2021 and then again this year. We're still a year away from being able to buy one of these innovative ice cream makers for our homes, but the company came to CES this year with the news that its restaurant partners will have hold of the machines much sooner.\nThe countertop ice cream maker uses Keurig-like pods to make a bowl of the cold stuff in less than 2 minutes. The finished result has a gelato-like consistency that had us coming back for more every time we passed the ColdSnap booth.\nRobot stain fighter\nSamsung is set to unveil its Bespoke Jet Bot Combo this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nHere's a product sure to clean up -- literally. Samsung's new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, a smart robot vacuum with a mop, does more than just get rid of dust bunnies and dog hair. It's designed to roam your rooms scouting for stains on hard flooring and scrub them out so you don't have to.\nThe robot taps AI-powered object recognition to identify stains on hard flooring. Yes, it can tell the difference between the surfaces, presumably making adjustments to its cleaning technique accordingly. You can also tell this likely $1,000-plus household helper where it can and can't go as it attacks stains as bad as a puppy piddle or a zinfandel spill with a spinning mop that hits 170 rpm. (Pricing details aren't yet available.)\nTeeth tech\nAI isn't just helping keep your floors clean, it's also being used to make sure your teeth are as clean as they can be. The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush features an algorithm-controlled motor, five brush modes tailored to specific needs, an interactive touchscreen that shows you areas you missed and, brilliantly/weirdly, an AI voice guide that speaks into your brain via bone conduction to help you improve your technique.\nIt also features Wi-Fi connectivity so you can pair it with your home network, and it will store information about your brushing history until you can download it to your app. It also offers 40 days of battery life through wireless charging. It will go on sale in the US in the fall for $130.\nIt's all in the wristwatch remote\nWhat if your smartwatch could also control your lamps, your Netflix programs and more?\nImagine using your wrist to control everything around you. A flick this way, and you can turn off the lights or scroll through the offerings on Netflix. Finnish startup Doublepoint has developed software that can turn an Android watch into a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection.\nThe software will come to developers in the first half of this year,\nbut it's up to developers and app-makers to decide what a small gesture, such as tapping fingers or rotating your wrist, will actually do.\nSteven Musil, Sareena Dayaram, Katie Collins and Ty Pendlebury contributed to this article.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"
