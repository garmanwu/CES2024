        "raw_content": "The Matter innovations at CES 2024\nThis year\u2019s CES trade fair was dominated by artificial intelligence and digital assistants such as ChatGPT. There was much less talk of the smart home standard Matter than last time and the number of product presentations in this area also decreased. Apart from the AI hype, which overshadowed pretty much everything, there are probably two main reasons for that.\nOn the one hand, manufacturers have become more cautious with their announcements. Not least because the implementation of the standard is still struggling with teething troubles. Just think of issues with incompatible Thread Border Routers (more on that in this interview) or the difficulties some manufacturers have had getting started with bridges. On the other hand, Matter is losing some of its appeal as a marketing tool because the name is currently no guarantee that certified products will work equally well in all ecosystems.\nThe major platforms, from Alexa to SmartThings, are moving at their own pace when it comes to integrating new device categories and functions. This means that a Matter logo on the packaging is less useful as a guide than the familiar \u201cWorks with\u201d emblems from Amazon, Apple, Google & Co. The platforms\u2019 own certification programs, some of which build on Matter, therefore retain their significance. The standard itself is taking more of a back seat as a connection technology.\nWith one click directly to: Amazon, Aqara, Ecovacs, LG, Lockly, MuiLab, Nanoleaf, Razer, Roborock\nAmazon: Matter Casting\nThe option to stream audio and video signals has been part of the standard since Matter 1.0. It lies dormant in the media player specifications, which also control basic TV functions such as volume and channel switching. So far, no manufacturer has made use of it. Amazon has announced its application for the first time at CES 2024 (link) \u2013 and even coined a name for it: \u201cMatter Casting\u201d.\nThanks to Matter Casting, it will be possible to stream a program from Amazon\u2019s Prime Video app to suitable end devices. The company names its Echo Show 15 as the first compatible receiver. Devices with Fire TV functionality are to follow in the coming months, including televisions from Panasonic with the Fire TV operating system, which were also announced at CES (link).\nIn its announcement, Amazon emphasizes the open nature of the standard, which makes it possible for all manufacturers to integrate Matter Casting into their devices. Program providers such as Pluto TV, Sling TV, Starz and Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF) are probably already on board and want to integrate Matter Casting into their apps. However, industry giants such as Disney, Netflix, Paramount and YouTube have not yet commented.\nIt also seems unclear whether the other three major Matter supporters will follow and also integrate Matter Casting into their ecosystems. Apple has long since launched its own solution with AirPlay, Google has established Chromecast and Samsung with SmartThings uses various technologies for screen mirroring.\nAqara: Hub M3 and more\nThe long-awaited M3 smart home hub from Aqara showed its potential for the first time at CES. It is not simply an improved M2 hub, but has some interesting extras. In addition to its expected function as a Matter Bridge for Zigbee devices from Aqara and infrared remote control, Thread and Bluetooth are additional wireless protocols. The M3 also serves as a Border Router and should be able to create Matter Bindings between Thread products from Aqara. So that these work independently, without the involvement of a hub.\nAbove all, however, Aqara is taking the step towards its own Matter ecosystem. Instead of only passing on connected products to Apple, Google & Co., the hub can also manage and automate devices from other manufacturers as a Matter controller. To be on the safe side, Aqara points out that support for such third-party products will only be introduced gradually. And that some Matter device categories will probably not be available when the hub is launched in the second quarter of 2024. But this is not unusual in the new smart home standard.\nAn absolute novelty is the Border Router Plug. A Thread smart plug that not only amplifies wireless signals in the Thread network (as everyone else does), but also connects the mesh to a home network via Wi-Fi. This allows Thread products to be used with Matter controllers that do not support the wireless protocol itself.\nWhether this only applies to Aqara\u2019s own controllers or also to third-party products such as Amazon\u2019s Echo Dot or a first-generation HomePod remains to be seen. In principle, the border router functionality can be integrated into all kinds of devices, but so far, it has only been found in smart home hubs, smart speakers and smart displays. Aqara is the first to integrate it into an end device such as the smart plug, making Thread easy to retrofit in any household without having to buy a new hub.\nThe third new Aqara product presented at the trade fair in Las Vegas was a smart lock called U300. The door lock drive with Thread radio, Matter and numeric keypad is the international brother of the EU model U200, which the manufacturer presented at IFA in fall 2023. Aqara has not yet given any delivery dates for either product \u2013 U300 and Border Router Plug. They should be available to order \u201cin the coming months\u201d.\nEcovacs: Deebot X2 Combo\nEcovacs Robotics has put together a special package for CES: The Chinese manufacturer combines the top model of its vacuum robots \u2013 the Deebot X2 Omni (around 1500 US dollars) \u2013 with a handheld vacuum cleaner. The associated docking station empties both and also takes care of the mop of the robot, cleaning and moistening it. Why the combination is listed here: Because the robot vacuum is one of the first models to make use of the device category of the same name in Matter 1.2. It can be integrated into Matter-enabled smart home systems and starts work automatically when they give the command. Visitors to the trade fair in Las Vegas were told a price of around 1600 US dollars and a sales date at the end of March. Ecovacs will announce availability and prices for Europe at a later date (link)\nLG: TVs with Google Home\nLG announced its support for the Matter standard at CES 2022. An update to the LG ThinQ app in 2023 made it possible to use LG TVs as Matter controllers \u2013 provided they had the webOS23 operating system and the Home Hub function (link). However, there was no consistent concept behind this initial launch.\nThis is set to change with the 2024 model year. At the press conference in Las Vegas, the Korean manufacturer changed course: Erik Kay, Vice President of Technology at Google, took to the stage and explained that LG televisions will serve as \u201chubs for Google Home\u201d in the future. This could relieve LG from the task of having to maintain the software of a Matter controller themselves and adapt it to new versions of the standard. Instead, the TV set and ThinQ app will access Google functions. An interesting move to be able to offer a mature Matter ecosystem and at the same time counter Samsung\u2019s SmartThings world.\nThe cooperation is part of Google\u2019s strategy to bring the company\u2019s smart home platform to products from other manufacturers. In addition to LG televisions, \u201cselected Google TVs and other devices with the Android TV operating system\u201d will also serve as a Google Home Hub in future (link).\nLockly: Smart Lock Visage\nThe upcoming smart lock from US provider Lockly was quite literally an head-turner. Visage \u2013 as the battery-powered drive for deadbolt locks is called \u2013 captures the facial features of a person, just like smartphones do. If the 3D scan matches the stored data of authorized residents, the door opens. A finger sensor is available as a further biometric method. The smart lock will also support the Matter standard and Apple\u2019s HomeKey technology when it is launched on the US market this summer for around 350 dollars (link). For Lockly locks that are already available, the manufacturer is planning a bridge called Matter Link, which establishes a connection to Matter platforms via Wi-Fi (link).\nMui Lab: Mui Bord 2.0\nRegular readers will be familiar with the Mui Board 2.0. It was already in the 2023 CES selection and was actually due to be launched last year. The crowdfunding campaign has now been opened on Kickstarter for the CES in January (link). Interested parties can pre-order the smart Japanese wooden board with touch surface for around 500 US dollars and then hope for delivery in December 2024.\nNanoleaf: new essentials\nThe illumination specialist is expanding its Matter product family with three new products: a multi-colored light strip with individually controllable LEDs, a garland for outdoor use (Outdoor String Light) and a light strip for use on buildings that bathes facades in colored light (Wall Wash). The basic functions of all three can be controlled via Matter systems, but only show their full splendor with the Nanoleaf app. Prices, technical details and delivery dates are not yet known.\nNanoleaf also announced the launch of its Skylight ceiling light, which was presented as a Matter product at CES 2023. The modular system of illuminated squares can now be pre-ordered on the Nanoleaf website \u2013 with prices starting at 250 US dollars (link). The extension tile costs 70 US dollars. Interestingly, however, the store no longer mentions the Matter standard. The logo is also missing, in contrast to the Essentials products. Instead, for Skylight, Nanoleaf works exclusively with the familiar \u201cWorks with\u201d emblems of the major smart home systems. When asked, the manufacturer confirmed that the Matter standard is currently not supported. However, Nanoleaf is planning to integrate it into panel products soon. As to when and how, the company makes no statement.\nRazer: Aether Monitor Light Bar\nGamers can now equip their playroom with even more Matter-compatible lights from Razer. The Californian accessory specialist presented a monitor light bar that illuminates the desk and is said to offer a very natural color rendering of CRI 95 (Colour Rendering Index). Colored LEDs, which can also be integrated into Razer\u2019s own Chroma RGB control system, radiate towards the back of the room. The Aether Monitor Light Bar with Wi-Fi connection costs 130 US dollars and will be available from March (link).\nThe light bar is complemented by two table lamps for the gaming suite, which illuminate the rest of the room. The Aether Lamp (80 dollars) emits the same light color all around \u2013 controlled via Matter or Chroma RGB (link). The Aether Lamp Pro (130 dollars) offers multi-zone lighting with individually adjustable colors. There is also a Matter-compatible light strip and a matching Wi-Fi lamp.\nRoborock: S8 MaxV Ultra\nWith Roborock, another Chinese manufacturer is jumping on the Matter bandwagon and will equip its new top model with the standard. The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra is set to use all Matter 1.2 robot vacuum commands when it is launched on the US market later this year for around 1,800 US dollars. Prerequisite: The Matter ecosystems will be ready to support robot vacuums by then. Its hefty price tag is the result of an unprecedented combination of cleaning functions. According to the manufacturer, the S8 MaxV Ultra not only has a very high suction power of 10,000 Pa (Pascal), but also a mop system with water heated to 60 degrees Celsius (140\u00b0F). Other features include a sophisticated corner cleaning system and its own offline voice assistant called Rocky (link).\nShare this information:\nSponsor / Advertising\nSponsor / Advertising\n\u00a92021 - 2024 matter-smarthome.de"

Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nCES 2024 is in full swing, and more innovative product reveals were made on day 2 of the biggest tech show of the year. And since it's the biggest show, we know not everyone is going to catch the hundreds of announcements across the more than 4,000 exhibitors.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nZDNET has cut through all the noise to bring you the most important and biggest announcements and products of day 2 that you may have missed. We were even able to go hands-on with some of these products below.\nStay tuned for even more product and big tech announcements tomorrow for CES day 3.\n1. New features coming to Android devices\nAndroid users will appreciate the several exciting announcements that Google made at CES Day 2. The most important feature coming to Android devices next month is a cross-Android solution called Quick Share. Quick Share will offer peer-to-peer content sharing across all types of Android-based devices, such as phones and even Chromebooks.\nAlso: CES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nOther new features and updates include Fast Pair support expansion, more casting capabilities to more apps and devices (including TikTok), and Android Auto integration into more vehicles like the new \u00a0Ford Mustang Mach-E and F-150 Lightning.\n2. Nanoleaf's impressive smart lighting\nSmart lighting company, Nanoleaf, announced some exciting additions to its smart lighting lineup, including a new Orchestrator software for music integrations. The software connects directly to a computer's sound source and isolates the response to the device, resulting in the lights reacting to an audio track's precise different layers.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight was also revealed, which the company says is a set of square light panels that are meant to be installed on the ceiling and capable of emitting 1400 lumens per square. Other product announcements included multicolor outdoor string lights with Matter support.\n3. EcoFlow's whole-house portable power station\nThe EcoFlow Delta Pro Ultra generator has been recognized as a 2024 CES Innovation Awards Honoree thanks to its impressive specs. These include a power capacity of 6kWh (an entire home), and capable of 7200W output and 5.6kW of solar input. The system is also compatible with expansion packs, increasing the power capacity to a whopping 90kWh which can run power to your home's essential appliances for up to an entire month.\nAlso: The best CES 2024 gadgets you can buy right now\nZDNET writer Maria Diaz got to try this powerful generator at her own home and called it the \"Swiss Army Knife of home backup systems,\" adding that it's also \"a whisper-quiet solution, one that you can't even hear when under 2000W.\"\n4. Android's answer to Apple Watch's double-tap feature\nThe Wow Mouse app was built for Android smartwatches to act as an extension to the smartwatch, letting you control tech around you via Bluetooth with just a gesture of your hands. It's kind of similar to Apple's Double-Tap feature on the Apple Watch, but instead of controlling things on the watch itself, Wow Mouse takes it up a notch and allows users to turn their smart lights on or off or lower the volume of a speaker.\n5. A battery that charges your phone in mere seconds\nCES is all about using tech to provide solutions, and this external smartphone battery from Swappery solves the problem of a dead battery in just seven seconds. Here's how it works: When your phone runs out of juice, place it in the Swapery station, wait seven seconds, then remove it to get a new battery attachment that will last you approximately 8-10 hours, the company says.\nAlso: The best mobile accessories at CES 2024: Qi2 chargers, face-tracking phone stands, and more\nThough it isn't your most conventional charger, it could give you a fully charged battery without needing any other cables, adapters, or plug-ins.\n6. Lenovo's hybrid laptop\nLenovo announced the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid at CES day 2, and it's impressive for two reasons. First, it's a 2-in-1 device that can be a laptop with an Intel Core Ultra 7 processor, or a touchscreen tablet with a Qualcomm Snapdragon 8+ processor. Second, it switches between Windows and Android seamlessly, depending on what \"mode\" (tablet or laptop) you choose.\nAlso: Lenovo made a Mac Studio for Windows users, and it might even be better\nEach component of this hybrid device even has its own battery. It'll cost you $1,999, but you really get a seperate tablet and a laptop all in one for the price.\n7. An AI gadget that interacts with apps so you don't have to\nRabbit is going back to the basics at CES 2024 with its Rabbit R1 device that wants to essentially replace the need for your smartphone when it comes to using apps. The little gadget fits into your palm and uses AI to see and learn how a user interacts with their typical smartphone apps and web experiences and then reproduce it (when verbally asked) on a customized cloud platform.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nThe basis is really for those who may want to solve their smartphone addiction since it scrolls your apps for you. Rabbit says some of the popular apps you can task R1 with include Spotify, Apple Music, DoorDash, Uber, Amazon, and more.\n8. Amazon introduces Matter Casting\nAmazon is taking a page out of Apple and Google's casting playbook and introduced a new way to cast videos from your phones and tablets directly on supported Amazon devices. Called Matter Casting, you can now cast Prime Video content to the Echo Show 15. Support for Fire TV devices, including TVs with Fire TV built in, will roll out in the next few months, and Amazon added that it hopes to add Matter Casting capabilities to services like Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, STARZ, and more within the year.\nUnlike Apple AirPlay and Google Chromecast, Amazon's Matter Casting uses the Matter Protocol of the open technology standard so that smart home tech from different brands can all work together more seamlessly.\nRelated\nCES 2024 Day 3: The 6 announcements you may have missed\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nCES Day 4: ZDNET's top 10 CES stories you don't want to miss"

        "raw_content": "The top Matter-compatible devices announced at CES 2024\nFor years, a coalition of companies, including Google, Amazon and Apple \u2014 the Connectivity Standards Alliance \u2014 has been trying to get Matter, the smart home networking protocol, off the ground. Unlike many of the standards that came before it (e.g. Zigbee, Z-Wave), Matter doesn\u2019t require a proprietary hub and runs locally, making it more robust to interruptions like power and internet outages.\nBut it\u2019s been rough going.\nMatter has fallen well short of promises so far, suffering from poor implementation and significant backpedaling. The initial version, released in 2022, didn\u2019t even support robot vacuum cleaners. And major features like multi-admin, which in theory allows Matter devices to work with every smart home platform simultaneously, remain broken pending future standards patches.\nThe setbacks haven\u2019t dissuaded Matter\u2019s backers from forging ahead, however \u2014 as evidenced by the announcements at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, which we\u2019ve recapped below. Maybe \u2014 just maybe \u2014 2024 will be Matter\u2019s year.\nLG TVs\nDuring its press conference on Monday, LG announced that LG TVs will soon (sometime later this year) act as Matter controllers \u2014 letting users set up, view and control all their Matter-compatible devices from one place. The support extends to hardware within Google Home, Google\u2019s smart home product family; during LG\u2019s presser, Google\u2019s Eric Kay said that LG TV users will be able to manage \u201cboth LG and Google Home devices right from the TV.\u201d\nImage Credits: LG\nNanoleaf lights\nNanoleaf, the smart lighting company, unveiled its first dedicated outdoor lights at CES: The Smart Multicolor Outdoor String Lights and Smart Multicolor Permanent Outdoor Lights. Set to launch in early spring, both are Matter-compatible \u2014 a part of Nanoleaf\u2019s Matter Essentials line.\nThe new lights can be programmed with most major voice assistants \u2014 an advantage of the Matter standard \u2014 as well as Matter-compatible apps including Nanoleaf\u2019s official app. They come with preset lighting scenes and can be integrated with other Nanoleaf products, allowing the lights to be grouped with other lights and automated using app-defined schedules.\nNanoleaf\u2019s new outdoor lights. Image Credits: Nanoleaf\nIn addition to the new outdoor lights, Nanoleaf said that its previously announced $249.99 Smart Modular Ceiling Light \u2014 square LED ceiling panels designed to mimic a roof skylight \u2014 will go on sale this month and work with Matter. The Smart Multicolor Lightstrip, Nanoleaf\u2019s first color-changing addressable indoor light strip, will also work with Matter when it hits store shelves this spring, the company said.\nLockly Visage\nSmart lock company Lockly took to CES 2024 with one of the more futuristic Matter-supporting devices out there: a smart lock that can scan your face. Set to launch this summer priced at $350, the wireless Visage lock employs a pair of infrared sensors to detect and scan faces within a few feet.\nThe Visage, which can store up to 100 face profiles, allows users to authenticate themselves in other ways, including through fingerprints and Apple\u2019s Home Key. Matter certification is technically still pending, Lockly said in full transparency \u2014 but once it arrives (hopefully before the Visage\u2019s retail rollout), the Visage will work with Apple\u2019s Home app along with tech like Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa.\nImage Credits: Lockly\nLockly also announced at CES that its $80 Matter Link Hub, which allows users to manage older Lockly devices from Matter-supporting apps and devices, will become available later this year. The company previously stated that the hub was coming but hadn\u2019t provided a launch window until this week.\nAqara Hub M3\nAqara, the smart home upstart, brought its long-teased Matter-compatible hub \u2014 the Hub M3 \u2014 to CES 2024.\nThe M3 sports an IR blaster for controlling devices like older TVs and AC units, which can be exposed to Matter-friendly apps and devices. A system-on-chip executes device automations programmed via Aqara\u2019s app or a third-party Matter app like Apple Home, Google Home or Amazon Alexa locally, even if the internet\u2019s down \u2014 and users who pick up a second M3 can benefit from an automatic backup feature that mirrors all automations to the secondary hub.\nImage Credits: Aqara\nAqara hasn\u2019t announced pricing for the M3, but said it\u2019ll launch in Q2 2024, with support for third-party Matter devices to roll out in \u201cwaves.\u201d\nBeyond the M3, Aqara debuted the Smart Lock U300, a smart lock for doors with lever locks such as garage doors and side entries. Packing a keypad, fingerprint reader, NFC reader and a battery that lasts up to eight months, the U300 works with Aqara\u2019s app or any third-party Matter app.\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nRoborock, a longtime fixture of the robot vacuum cleaner market, launched its first Matter-compatible vacuum at CES: the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra.\nPriced at $1,800, the S8 MaxV Ultra features a motorized arm that pushes the robot vacuum\u2019s side brush into small corners and a camera for AI-powered obstacle avoidance. Also in tow is an extra spinning mop, a powerful vibrating mopping pad and a charging dock that can connect directly to a home\u2019s drainage system and wash the robot\u2019s mop with hot water.\nImage Credits: Roborock\nOne of the niftier capabilities of the S8 MaxV Ultra is a voice assistant, Rocky, that can understand basic commands like \u201cclean the kitchen\u201d and \u201cempty the bin.\u201d It works both in person \u2014 when the S8 MaxV Ultra is within shouting distance \u2014 and remotely through a video calling feature.\nWorth noting is that, while the S8 MaxV Ultra technically is technically Matter-compatible, none of the major smart home platforms have added support for robot vacuums through Matter yet. It\u2019s not clear whether that\u2019ll change by April, when the S8 MaxV Ultra goes on sale.\nMui Board Gen 2\nThe Mui Board 2 isn\u2019t new, per se \u2014 it was first showcased at CES 2023 \u2014 but this week marked the launch of the smart home device touch controller\u2019s crowdfunding campaign on Kickstarter.\nThe Mui Board 2 was designed to look like a piece of wood trimming, with light-illuminated controls (including timers) for various smart home products. Its LED dot matrix display shows things like the time and weather in addition to info from sensors such as thermostats.\nImage Credits: Mui\nSince the Mui Board 2 has Matter support, it can be used to control a range of Matter-compatible hardware \u2014 including some of the hardware in this roundup.\nAmazon Matter Casting\nIt\u2019s not a device launch, really. But Amazon became the first to support Matter Casting, the video- and audio-beaming feature of the Matter smart home standard, on its smart displays and smart TVs this week.\nOnce Matter Casting comes to Amazon\u2019s Prime Video app for Android and iOS, users will be able to cast content to supported Amazon devices \u2014 starting with the Echo Show 15 \u2014 by tapping the new dedicated Matter Casting button. Beyond the Echo Show 15, Amazon says that Matter Casting support will arrive on Fire TVs, including smart TVs from Panasonic with Fire TV built in, and \u2014 on the app side \u2014 Plex, Pluto TV, Sling TV, Starz and ZDF later this year.\n\u201cCustomers can begin watching a movie or browse for their next favorite show from Prime Video on their phone, and cast it to their compatible Fire TV device or Echo Show 15,\u201d Amazon writes in a post published on its official blog. \u201cThis is an industry-first demonstration of implementing Matter Casting.\u201d"

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nCES 2023: Matter \u2014 Unlocking The Smart Home\nMatter\nEvery year, after recovering from CES, I take a step back and evaluate the most influential IoT technology trends. This year\u2019s winner is Matter, a new industry standard for smart home connectivity with the potential to change the course of consumer electronics (CE) product development. In this post, I won\u2019t review the hundreds of Matter-enabled products announced at CES \u2014 other tech news outlets cover that in detail. Instead, I\u2019ll look at Matter from a business perspective, explaining what it is, why it\u2019s a game-changer for the CE industry, and how it\u2019s becoming an influential design pattern for IoT connectivity in other vertical industries. Click here for a more comprehensive analysis of Matter.\nWhat\u2019s Matter?\nToday, most smart homes use a hodgepodge of incompatible products, protocols, and wireless device networks \u2014 Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Thread, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Lutron, Insteon, and others. I use three device networks in my home, connected to half a dozen home automation ecosystems (Alexa, HomeKit, Google, and others). This setup requires 14 smartphone apps, each with unique user IDs and passwords. Matter cleans up this mess by standardizing three things \u2014 Internet Protocol (IP) device networks, a common \u201clanguage\u201d for home automation, and simple, consistent methods for setting up secure devices. I can buy a Matter device from any manufacturer, install it in a few minutes, and use it with any home automation ecosystem.\nIP networking is the key to understanding Matter. Your PC and smartphone don\u2019t care if you\u2019re browsing the Web, watching a video, or sending an email. That\u2019s the miracle of the internet: standard protocols define how to encode and send content-agnostic messages. Over the past 20 years, a patchwork of smart home device ecosystems evolved using many incompatible protocols and wireless networks. Matter unifies device communication by specifying a common \u201clanguage\u201d that works over widely deployed, IP-bearing networks \u2014 Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread. Messages like \u201cTurn on the patio lights\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s the temperature setpoint?\u201d are the same for all Matter-enabled lighting controls and thermostats, regardless of manufacturer or network connection. Matter also specifies how devices join home networks, often with a single tap on a smartphone.\nIn addition to specifying a standard smart home application protocol, Matter tests products in independent labs to validate interoperability across all manufacturers. The Matter logo on a product assures consumers that it is compatible with all other Matter-enabled devices and smart home ecosystems. By making connected CE products easy to buy, install, and use, Matter expands the smart home market beyond early adopters and technology enthusiasts to include all homeowners.\nMatter has mass\nThree years ago, some of the biggest brands in consumer electronics (Amazon, Apple, Google, and more than 200 others) agreed that smart home market growth was consistently disappointing, mainly because products from different manufacturers and ecosystems were incompatible. Instead of competing for a bigger slice of a small pie, these companies agreed to join forces and bake a bigger pie.\nBest Travel Insurance Companies\nBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance Plans\nTo address the smart home fragmentation problem, the group created \u201cProject Connected Home over IP\u201d (later rebranded \u201cMatter\u201d) under the auspices of the Connectivity Standards Alliance, the home of Ziggee, and other standards. Since then, the working group invested \u201cHundreds of thousands of person-hours\u201d in the effort, according to Tobin Richardson, CEO of the organization. He\u2019s not exaggerating \u2014 the core specification is more than 1300 pages. Matter 1.0 is now publicly available, over 550 products are certified or in the certification pipeline, and Matter is one of the hottest topics in the global CE industry.\nStandards rarely deliver commercial results quickly or generate much excitement, but Matter is different for two reasons. First, Matter specifies how to implement, use, and validate proven, widely deployed standards and networks rather than creating new technologies. Specifically, Matter builds on Internet Protocols and IP-bearing networks \u2014 the same ones we use on smartphones and PCs. Second, hundreds of the world\u2019s leading CE, cloud services, and semiconductor companies are fully committed to Matter, and many are already shipping products. Although Matter is still a work in progress, it\u2019s on track to become the dominant smart home connectivity framework over the next two or three years.\nMatter has gravity\nAs touched on above, Matter allows products from different manufacturers to connect seamlessly and operate harmoniously over existing Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread networks. Thread is an industry-standard mesh network for small, low-power devices, similar in function to Zigbee and Z-Wave. Although Thread is not as well-known as Wi-Fi, it\u2019s already active in many homes because millions of smart speakers, hubs, and other products from Apple, Google, and Amazon already have Thread or will soon get it via a software update.\nFor consumers, Matter simplifies buying, installing, configuring, and using smart home products, resulting in lower adoption barriers and better user experiences. Homeowners can be confident that all Matter devices are compatible with one another and with Matter-enabled home automation platforms from Amazon, Apple, Google, and others.\nIn addition to improving consumer experiences, Matter is a game-changer for the worldwide consumer electronics industry. Defragmenting the smart home market increases product development efficiency, reduces supply chain friction, and removes many barriers to smart home market growth, leading to larger economies of scale.\nMatter ushers in a new era where the entire home is a platform for plug-and-play products that are easier and less costly to build, buy, install, and use. The first wave of Matter products is already shipping, and product availability will accelerate rapidly over the next few years.\nMatter is solid\nEarly adopters of any new technology should expect a rough spot or two. However, early feedback on Matter user experiences is overwhelmingly positive. Good results aren\u2019t surprising, given the thorough testing over the past year by big companies with a lot at stake. The first wave of Matter devices is limited to these seven device categories:\nWe won\u2019t have to wait very long for this list to grow. The Connectivity Standards Alliance plans to release new types of devices on a regular six-month cadence, starting with these categories:\nIf Matter doesn\u2019t yet support a type of device you need, or if you already have smart home devices using an older device connectivity scheme such as Zigbee or Z-Wave, you have two options \u2014 coexistence and bridging.\nCoexistence means using what you already have as you add Matter devices. Most home automation ecosystems can simultaneously support Matter, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and other connectivity schemes, so it\u2019s easy to grow your Matter device collection while still using your old stuff. For example, telling your smart speaker to \u201cTurn on the outside lights\u201d can use Matter, while \u201cTurn up the temperature\u201d can use Zigbee, Z-Wave, or some other application protocol.\nBridging is better than simple coexistence because it brings legacy devices into the Matter world \u2014 and it\u2019s part of the Matter core specification. A Matter bridge is a hub that connects simultaneously to your home IP network and to a legacy device ecosystem using native protocols. The bridge translates Matter messages into the appropriate protocol for the legacy system and vice-versa, enabling device-to-device communication between different device ecosystems. We expect to see Matter bridges for Zigbee, Z-Wave, and other ecosystems in early 2023.\nStarting now, it makes sense to buy Matter devices whenever you can get the required functionality. Use bridges to connect Matter to other device ecosystems such as Zigbee and Z-Wave.\n2023 IoT technology trend predictions\nA year ago, I predicted that three technology trends would converge to accelerate growth in IoT products:\nThese predictions came true, for the most part. Matter was the star of the show at CES 2023, Matter-optimized silicon and software platforms from multiple suppliers streamlined device development, and the growth rate for edge analytics stands at about 22% to 38% per year, depending on the analyst\u2019s level of optimism.\nThese three trends comprise a virtuous cycle \u2014 \u201cThe Matter Effect\u201d \u2014 a positive loop that turbocharges smart home growth. Here\u2019s how it works.\nSmarter, simpler products built on standard platforms reduce friction across the CE marketplace, and the cycle repeats. This is how the smart home market transitions from early adopters to mainstream consumers over the next two or three years.\nThis year, I\u2019m doubling down on Matter. I\u2019ll be closely watching these two embedded technology trends.\nAs long as we regard embedded computing as separate and distinct from mainstream computing, IoT industry growth will continue to disappoint, as it has for the past 10 years. Matter is leading the way to a \u201cmainstream embedded\u201d design pattern based on IP networking with a standardized, industry-specific device \u201clanguage\u201d (commands, attributes, and artifacts), a unified security architecture, and a layered interaction model that defines how components interact.\nStandardizing how embedded devices communicate and interact enables the independent development of device platforms, device applications, and higher-level application services \u2014 similar to how we write software for PCs and smartphones.

The multi-day trade event put on by the Consumer Technology Association is set to feature swaths of the latest advances and gadgets across personal tech, transportation, health care, sustainability and more \u2014 with burgeoning uses of artificial intelligence almost everywhere you look.\nThe Associated Press will be keeping a running report of everything we find interesting from the floor of CES, from the most interesting developments in vehicle tech, to wearables designed to improve accessibility to the newest smart home gadgets.\n___\nPLAYSTATION CONTROLLER MAKES A CAMEO APPEARANCE AT SONY ANNOUNCEMENT\nIzumi Kawanishi, president and COO of Sony Honda Mobility Inc., holds up a PlayStation controller before using it to drive an Afeela EV onto the stage during a Sony press conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)\nSony Honda Mobility returned to the CES this year with some updates to its Afeela EV. While the car itself may not be any closer to moving out from being a concept, Sony had some fun with it: they drove it onto the stage with a PlayStation controller.\nPresident of Sony Honda Mobility Izumi Kawanishi was quick to point out that Afeela owners likely won\u2019t be driving cars using controllers in the future.\n\u2014\u2014\nHYUNDAI SEES A FUTURE IN HYDROGEN\nJose Munoz, president and global CEO of Hyundai Motor Company, speaks during a Hyundai news conference before the start of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nHyundai on Monday spotlighted its future plans for utilizing hydrogen energy. Beyond hydrogen-powered fuel cell vehicles, the South Korean automaker pointed to the possibilities of moving further into move further into energy production, storage and transportation -- as Hyundai works towards contributing to \u201cthe establishment of a hydrogen society.\u201d Company leaders say this sets them apart from other automakers.\n\u201cWe are introducing a way to turn organic waste and even plastic into clean hydrogen. This is unique,\u201d Jos\u00e9 Mu\u00f1oz, president and global Chief Operating Officer of Hyundai Motor Company, said in a Monday press conference at CES 2024.\nHyundai also shared plans to further define vehicles based off of their software offerings and new AI technology. With so-called \u201csoftware defined vehicles,\u201d that could include opportunities for consumers to pay for features on demand -- such as advanced driver assistance or autonomous driving -- down the road. Hyundai also aims to integrate its own large language model into its navigation system.\n\u2014\u2014\nSAMSUNG AND HYUNDAI TEAM UP TO ADD AI TO YOUR CAR\nJH Han, CEO and Head of the Device Experience Division at Samsung Electronics, speaks during a Samsung press conference ahead of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/John Locher)\nSamsung has announced that they are collaborating with Hyundai to develop \u201chome-to-car\u201d and \u201ccar-to-home\u201d services to all Kia and Hyundai vehicles.\nWhat that means is that people will be able to use Samsung\u2019s SmartThings service to set your car\u2019s cabin temperature or open its windows, and when you\u2019re in your car, you\u2019ll be able to control your home\u2019s lights and interact with any of your connected smart devices.\nSamsung also announced a team-up with Microsoft to bring more Copilot AI functions to their flagship Galaxy smartphones.\n___\nA \u2018PAWFECT\u2019 COMPANION FOR YOUR PET?\nThe ORo robot dog companion by is displayed during CES Unveiled before the start of the CES tech show Sunday, Jan. 7, 2024, in Las Vegas. The robot is designed to interact with, feed, and distribute medication for pets automatically. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nBusy families with dogs may want to be on the lookout for a new AI-powered robot that promises to play with, feed and even give medicine to your furry best friend.\nConsumer robotics firm Ogmen was at CES 2024 to show its new ORo pet companion, an autonomous robot designed to assist with pet care by feeding, providing medicine and even playing with your dog using a ball launcher built into its chest.\n___\nTRANSPARENT TVs ARE HERE\nThe newly unveiled LG Signature OLED T transparent tv is seen during an LG news conference before the start of the CES tech show Monday, Jan. 8, 2024, in Las Vegas. (AP Photo/Ryan Sun)\nConsumer electronics giants LG and Samsung have unveiled transparent TVs at the show, with LG having just announced its OLED-powered display will go on sale later this year.\nAlmost invisible when turned off, LG\u2019s 77-inch transparent OLED screen can switch between transparent mode and a more traditional black background for regular TV mode.\n\u201cThe unique thing about OLED is it\u2019s an organic material that we can print on any type of surface,\u201d explains David Park from LG\u2019s Home Entertainment Division.\n\u201cAnd so what we\u2019ve done is printed it on a transparent piece of glass, and then to get the OLED picture quality, that\u2019s where we have that contrast film that goes up and down.\u201d\nContent is delivered wirelessly to the display using LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box which sends 4K images and sound.\nWhy would you need a transparent TV?\nWhen not being watched as a traditional TV, the OLED T can be used as a digital canvas for showcasing artworks, for instance.\nSamsung\u2019s transparent MICRO LED-powered display showed off the technology as a concept.\n___\nADS COMING TO SHOPPING CARTS\nFood companies advertise all over the grocery store with eye-catching packaging and displays. Now, Instacart hopes they\u2019ll start advertising right on your cart.\nThis week at CES, the San Francisco-based grocery delivery and technology company is unveiling a smart cart that shows video ads on a screen near the handle. General Mills, Del Monte Foods, and Dreyer\u2019s Grand Ice Cream are among the companies who will advertise on the carts during an upcoming pilot at West Coast stores owned by Good Food Holdings.\nInstacart says a screen might advertise deals or show a limited-edition treat, like Chocolate Strawberry Cheerios. It might also share real-time recommendations based on what customers put in the cart, like advertising ice cream if a customer buys cones.\nInstacart got into the cart business in 2021 when it bought Caper, which makes smart carts with cameras and sensors that automatically keep track of items placed in them. Instacart says it expects to have thousands of Caper Carts deployed by the end of this year.\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Later in the year, it will work across a range of other video services, including Plex, Starz, Pluto TV, Sling TV, and ZDF.\n\u200cAirPlay\u200c allows Apple device users to wirelessly stream video from an iPhone, iPad, or Mac to an Apple TV or another Mac, as well as stream audio from almost any Apple device to any HomePod, \u200cApple TV\u200c, or compatible third-party speaker. Google has a similar equivalent for its Chromecast devices called Google Cast. Both \u200cAirPlay\u200c and Google Cast are proprietary technologies, so Amazon's new feature is designed to be interoperable across platforms.\nApple and Google worked with Amazon on the Matter home standard, but they have not yet announced any plans to support Matter Casting and could choose to remain uninvolved. Nevertheless, it is clearly Amazon's wish to make video streaming apps and TV accessories work together more seamlessly, regardless of their platform.\nGet weekly top MacRumors stories in your inbox.\nTop Rated Comments\nPopular Stories\nNew iPad Air, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air Models Likely to Launch in March or April\nTwo Apple Stores in U.S. Permanently Closing Today\niPhone 7 Users in U.S. Could Receive Up to $349 Payment From Apple\nApple Releasing iOS 17.3 Next Week With These New Features\nApple Releases iOS 17.3 and iPadOS 17.3 With Stolen Device Protection, Collaborative Apple Music Playlists and More\nNext-Gen iPad Air With 12.9-Inch Display and Redesigned Camera Unit Revealed in CAD Renders\nApple Releases watchOS 10.3 With New Watch Face\nNext Article\nGuides\nOur comprehensive guide highlighting every major new addition in iOS 17, plus how-tos that walk you through using the new features.\nJournal app, spatial video recording, Messages sticker reaction improvements, Action button translate option, and more.\nGet the most out your iPhone 15 with our complete guide to all the new features.\nA deep dive into new features in macOS Sonoma, big and small.\nUpcoming\nThe Apple Vision Pro AR/VR headset is available to pre-order now in the U.S., with a launch coming on February 2.

        "raw_content": "Why Matter mattered at CES\nWe round up all the new product announcements and look at what\u2019s next for Matter as companies start to monetize this newfound interoperability.\nBy\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy, a smart home reviewer who's been testing connected gadgets since 2013. Previously a writer for Wirecutter, Wired, and BBC Science Focus.\nShare this story\nIf you buy something from a Verge link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\nFrom Central Hall to The Venetian, Matter was the buzzword throughout CES 2023 this year, with most companies even remotely connected to the smart home loudly discussing their Matter plans (although a few were more subdued). The new smart home standard was featured in several keynotes and displayed prominently in smart home device makers\u2019 booths as well as in Google, Amazon, and Samsung\u2019s big, showy displays.\nMore importantly, dozens of companies and manufacturers announced specific plans. Several companies said they would update entire product lines, while others announced new ones, sometimes with actual dates and prices. And Matter controllers have become a major thing, with at least four brand-new ones debuting at CES. Interestingly, nearly all of them have a dual or triple function, helping banish the specter of seemingly pointless white hubs stuck in your router closet.\nIts undeniable momentum at the biggest consumer tech show of the year is one reason we named Matter The Verge\u2019s \u201cbest in show\u201d for CES 2023. And here, we\u2019ve rounded up all the announcements from the show that, well, matter.\nRelated\nIn case you missed it, Matter is an open-source interoperability standard that allows smart home devices from any manufacturer to talk to other devices directly and locally with no need to use the cloud. This should make the smart home easier to set up, simpler to use, and more reliable to run. Matter works over\u00a0the protocols Thread, Wi-Fi, and ethernet and has been jointly developed by Apple, Google, Samsung, Amazon, and pretty much every other smart home brand you can name, big or small.\nIf a device supports Matter, it will work locally with Amazon Alexa, Samsung SmartThings, Apple Home, Google Home, and any other smart home platform that supports Matter. It will also be controllable by any of the four voice assistants.\nMatter should make the smart home easier to set up, simpler to use, and more reliable to run.\nHowever, Matter is still totally unproven, as there are very few devices anyone can actually get their hands on to test, so there is a lot of speculation still as to just how effective it will be. Plus, the initial Matter rollout since the launch in November has been complicated.\nThe big four have turned on Matter support on their platforms, but Amazon\u2019s approach has been piecemeal, and aside from Apple, nobody supports onboarding devices to Matter on iOS yet.\nHowever, that is shifting: at CES, Amazon announced a full rollout by spring, and Samsung\u2019s Jaeyeon Jung told The Verge that Matter support is coming to its iOS app this month. There\u2019s still no news on Matter support in Google Home\u2019s iOS app. Then there\u2019s the whole competing Thread network issue, although that sounds like it will be resolved sooner rather than later.\nIf all of these companies continue their support of Matter, then these early teething problems shouldn\u2019t be more than that. After all, the rollout of a new wireless standard is never going to be easy. Just ask the Wi-Fi Alliance and Bluetooth Special Interest Group, which both sent representatives to the Connectivity Standards Alliance\u2019s CES Matter party to show their support (and maybe sympathize).\nAnd the following cascade of announcements includes dozens of new products, so the Matter device drought should be over soon \u2014 although, judging by most of these ship dates, not until at least the second half of 2023.\nMatter updates coming to existing products\nNew Matter devices announced at CES\nThis is because Matter doesn\u2019t currently support the type of dynamic lighting effects that are the main feature of the lights. Patrick Miltner of GE Lighting told The Verge that the company might change that plan if and when Matter supports more advanced lighting functions. He also said it could upgrade all of the existing Direct Connect Cync lighting products to Matter with an over-the-air firmware update and will evaluate the benefit of doing that as Matter support rolls out more broadly across the industry.\nNew Matter controllers that launched at CES\nMatter controllers are required to onboard and control smart home devices in Matter. There are already a lot of Matter controllers out there \u2014 including 17 of Amazon\u2019s Echo devices, Apple\u2019s HomePod Mini and Apple TV line, and Google\u2019s Nest Hub smart displays and Nest speakers. Some Matter controllers are also Thread border routers and can onboard Thread devices to Matter; others work over Wi-Fi only.\nWhat\u2019s next for Matter?\nFor Matter to work, it needs mass adoption in the tech industry, and not every company is jumping in with both feet. A few are dipping an early toe in, while others are putting their feet up and waiting to see what the standard can really do for them. A handful have had very little to say at all.\nAlso, some companies that suggested they could offer Matter updates for existing products have walked that back.\u00a0That\u2019s in part because the Matter spec changed and in part because of the complexity of sending a firmware update to customers\u2019 devices that removes existing integrations and makes them have to re-pair it with all of their smart home services (something Eve had to deal with during its rollout of firmware updates last year).\nGE Lighting\u2019s Miltner told The Verge at CES that the company doesn\u2019t see the use in updating existing products to Matter as \u201cit will break their existing functions.\u201d Customers will have to reset devices to work with their favorite platforms. However, looking forward, Miltner sees the value. \u201cIt\u2019s one specification for every single product; it\u2019s the massive piece the smart home has been missing for so long.\u201d Once Matter hits critical mass, he believes there will be plenty of benefits for GE Lighting and its customers.\nA number of companies are taking this wait-and-see approach. \u201cIt benefits Schlage more to wait to see how things are going to come out first,\u201d Paul Wilkie, a spokesperson from lock manufacturer Schlage, told The Verge. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say that there\u2019s not already something in development \u2014 it\u2019s clear that there is something in development. But we are waiting to see how everything congeals over the next year.\u201d\nHe pointed out that it\u2019s one thing for smart lighting and plug manufacturers to jump on a new bandwagon, but for a device that secures your home like a lock, it\u2019s important to make sure people are ready for the new tech.\n\u201cIt\u2019s one specification for every single product; it\u2019s the massive piece the smart home has been missing for so long.\u201d \u2013 Patrick Miltner\nWhile Matter wasn\u2019t designed to leave existing smart home devices behind, it\u2019s appearing more likely the most benefit will be for the future smart home rather than the past or present one. \u201cWe have a go-forward strategy for Matter,\u201d Tobin Richardson, president of the CSA, which manages the Matter standard, confirmed to The Verge. \u201cMoving forward, Matter solves a lot of compatibility issues, but in terms of backward compatibility, not every device will be upgradeable. You may just be doing it through a gateway.\u201d He says that should be a straightforward process if manufacturers upgrade their bridges.\nFor those of you with robust smart home setups that you want to bring into Matter, bridging is going to be the most reliable route for backward compatibility. There aren\u2019t a lot of solutions yet, but a few companies \u2014 including Aqara and Philips Hue \u2014 have announced their platforms will support bridging into Matter.\nIt\u2019s also likely we\u2019ll see dedicated bridges coming out that can bring Z-Wave and other products with proprietary protocols into Matter. Silicon Labs announced a new Unify SDK that will provide both a hardware and software solution for manufacturers to do exactly this.\nOne company for whom bridging would make a lot of sense is Lutron, with its popular Caseta smart lighting line of switches and plugs. Adam Mack of Lutron Electronics told The Verge that while the company is a member of the CSA and is watching the rollout carefully, it has no announcements around adding support for the standard to its product line. Which, to be fair, is one of the most interoperable and reliable smart home products on the market today.\nIt\u2019s also clear that Matter needs to step up its support for more functions and device types. Currently, only basic functions are supported. Lights, locks, sensors, etc., will have basic control capabilities: on / off; lock / unlock; motion / no motion; brighten / dim. But Matter doesn\u2019t support advanced features such as dynamic lighting effects, adaptive lighting, shared access codes for door locks, and energy management for smart plugs.\nThose who want to use those features will need to either choose a platform that supports them (for example, the Apple Home app supports adaptive lighting) or use the manufacturer\u2019s app for that function (for example, the Eve app supports energy management for the Eve Energy plug).\nWe are also waiting on new device types to be supported in Matter. Initially, there will be support for light bulbs and light switches, plugs and outlets, door locks, thermostats, blinds and shades, sensors (motion and contact), bridges, and TVs.\nThe CSA told The Verge that its next release, slated for spring, will include support for battery performance (so you can keep track of battery life or devices such as sensors), white goods home appliances (such as fridges, washing machines), and robot vacuums. But cameras and garage door controllers, which were previously announced as coming next, look like they\u2019re still going to be a while.\n\u201cI have to remind them all that while monetization is important, this is building a market, not a way to shut others out.\u201d \u2013 Tobin Richardson\nThere are also a number of categories in the initial Matter spec with few or no actual products announced, like thermostats, for example. There\u2019s the Nest Thermostat (new) and a couple of radiator options that have been promised. But none of these have been updated yet and no timeline has been given. The Verge spoke with Ecobee CEO Stuart Lombard, who confirmed that its line of smart thermostats will support Matter but wouldn\u2019t give any further details. Previously, the company has said its thermostats could be upgraded to Matter with a firmware update and could support Thread.\u00a0Amazon hasn\u2019t said if its smart thermostat will be upgraded.\nSo, what is the biggest challenge for Matter now that it\u2019s had its big public debut and seemingly passed its big CES test? \u201cThe complexity can be a concern,\u201d Richardson, of the CSA, told The Verge. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is straightforward. How IoT happens can sometimes be so complex and confusing that consumers back away.\u201d\nIf every company continues to be invested in Matter and \u201cdoesn\u2019t back into proprietary shells,\u201d Richardson feels confident Matter will achieve all it set out to do. However, \u201cthe commercial teams are now coming in and looking for the differentiations,\u201d he said. \u201cI have to remind them all that while monetization is important, this is building a market, not a way to shut others out.\u201d\nMatter may not be the solution to the smart home\u2019s challenges that every company wanted. But it is the solution they got. Now, we wait and see if it\u2019s the solution they can actually deliver.\nFord\u2019s new 48-inch digital dashboard is a lot of Android for one car\nApple\u2019s sci-fi thriller Constellation gets haunting first trailer\niOS 17.3 is out, adding Stolen Device Protection for your iPhone\nThe Vision Pro\u2019s first killer app is the web, whether Apple likes it or not\nSamsung\u2019s smart ring might signal the start of a new wearable era\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2023: all the news from the year\u2019s biggest tech conference\nAt CES one company was showing off...an E-Ink headset?\nSix smart home finds from CES 2023 you may have missed\nThe regulatory maze behind health tech vaporware\nToday\u2019s Vergecast: the smart TVs, Matter gadgets, and concept cars from CES\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Matter innovations from CES 2023 at a glance\nAt the annual showcase of the electronics industry in Las Vegas, the Matter standard was part of the freestyle again. However, some supporters held back with announcements this time. They still have to fulfill last year\u2019s obligation: Deliver devices or software updates that were already announced for 2022. Many of the new products for 2023 will also probably not be available until the second half of the year. Here is an overview in alphabetical order.\nOne click directly to: Aqara, Athom, Bosch, Eve Systems, GE Lighting / Cync, Govee, Hisense, Mui Lab, Nanoleaf, Samsung / SmartThings, SwitchBot, TP-Link, Yeelight\nAqara\nAlready during CES 2022, Aqara had announced sensors using the Thread wireless protocol for Matter. This time, the P2 door/window contact and the P2 motion/light sensor were again a topic \u2013 and could be seen at the Google and Samsung booths. Market launch is planned for the \u201ccoming months\u201d, says the current press release. The software update of the Aqara Hub 2, originally planned for December, is also delayed. It is supposed to make the Zigbee hub of the company compatible with the Matter standard \u2013 and with it, a variety of the brand\u2019s devices. While the media initially mentioned January (link), Aqara no longer gives a specific date and generally talks about 2023.\nMore products supporting the Matter standard are expected to hit the market later this year \u2013 including the FP2 presence sensor, the T1 LED light strip and the U100 motor drive for deadlocks. All three work with Zigbee, so require an Aqara hub for connectivity. The G4 video doorbell would get along without this hub because it transmits via Wi-Fi, but for the moment it does not find a connection to Matter because its device class is still missing in the standard. Aqara wants to deliver the support as soon as video doorbells are available as a separate product category in Matter.\nAthom / Homey Pro\nThe Dutch company Athom has brought its brand-new product Homey Pro to the CES. The universal smart home control center can be pre-ordered on the manufacturer\u2019s website (link) and is scheduled for February. It already supports a variety of connectivity options at launch. Devices can be controlled via 433 MHz radio, Bluetooth 5.0, Z-Wave Plus, Zigbee 3.0, WLAN and infrared. But as far as Matter is concerned, it will still take a while: A software update that makes the hub compatible with the standard is planned for the 2nd quarter of 2023. The Thread protocol is to follow in the 3rd quarter. Homey Pro would then probably be the first Matter bridge to support all common, manufacturer-independent connection protocols in the smart home.\nBosch\nBosch used CES 2023 primarily to highlight its expertise in sensor technology and to showcase mobility solutions. Matter was not a topic in this context. However, the smart home division renewed its commitment at the same time: in 2023, the standard is to be gradually incorporated into the company\u2019s products (link). A new smart home controller has already been presented in Europe for this purpose. The second-generation unit works on Zigbee 3.0 and is to receive a software update for Matter during the year. Furthermore, new end devices are planned that support the Matter standard out of the box. However, the company has not yet revealed which devices will be available and when.\nEve Systems\nSince December 2022, three products from the Eve range can be converted retroactively to Matter with a special software update. In Las Vegas, the manufacturer has now announced the start of sales: From March 28, 2023, Eve Door & Window, Eve Energy and Eve Motion will be officially available in stores with the new Matter firmware. Buyers will be able to integrate them into a Matter ecosystem like Apple Home or Samsung SmartThings right out of the box.\nAt about the same time, the manufacturer also wants to deliver software updates for its Eve Motion Blinds. Those who already have roller blinds at home and do not want to purchase new ones from the interior decorator will also have the option of retrofitting: With the Upgrade Kit for Roller Blinds, Eve Systems will offer a tubular motor for existing roller blinds in the future. It can be controlled wirelessly via the Thread protocol and is Matter-compatible, just like custom-made models by a specialist.\nGE Lighting / Cync\nUnder the brand name Cync, GE Lighting already has a number of smart home products on the US market. At CES, the subsidiary of American home technology specialist Savant now announced its support for the Matter standard. The Cync range is to become compatible step by step. The Indoor Smart Plug and the Full Color Direct Connect Smart Bulb \u2013 two Wi-Fi products that work without a bridge \u2013 will make the start in 2023. They are to receive Matter-capable successors. A software update of the models sold so far is not planned, according to the manufacturer (link).\nGovee\nThe trade show highlight from Govee, a sync box for gamers, almost stole the show \u2013 but a novelty from the Chinese manufacturer is also interesting for people who don\u2019t want to synchronize their room lighting with screen content: Govee\u2019s LED strip light M1 gets a successor (link). It is named like its predecessor, but is significantly shorter (2 instead of 5 meters). On the other hand, it is supposed to support Matter from day one and is only the first link in a whole chain of Matter-compatible products. Planned delivery: 2nd quarter 2023.\nHisense\nThe Hisense Group, which claims to be the world\u2019s number two in TVs and household appliances, has positioned itself as a Matter supporter at CES. The Chinese company has joined the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) and wants to make its products compatible with the new standard (link). The group, which also owns brands such as ATAG, Gorenje and ASKO, has not yet announced the nature and scope of its plans. However, the first products that support Matter are to be launched on the market in 2023.\nMui Lab\nCES is a kind of home game for Mui Lab. The start-up from Kyoto has already won two CES Innovation Awards for its concept of a touch-sensitive wooden board \u2013 in 2019 and 2022. This time, too, the Japanese traveled to Las Vegas with their Mui Board 2.0 in their luggage. Like its predecessor, the new edition of the bar-shaped smart home controller lights up when touched and displays changing controls. After use, the LEDs go out behind the wood veneer, leaving an unobtrusive appearance. Mui Lab calls this principle \u201cCalm Tech\u201d. Thanks to Matter, the second generation is said to be significantly more powerful and versatile than its predecessor, which used the IoT platform IFTTT to control devices. The first Mui Board was also practically unavailable. That should be different with the successor. Crowdfunding for the product is to begin on Kickstarter in the summer. Delivery is planned for winter 2023.\nNanoleaf\nGimmy Chu, Nanoleaf CEO, had announced it in an interview last fall: \u201cWe plan to launch a number of new products that will work with\u00a0Matter\u00a0as soon as the new standard is available\u201d. Among the new products, the relaunch of the Essentials light series is still making the least impression. The Nanoleaf Skylight modular ceiling light caused more of a stir in Las Vegas. Consisting of square panels, it can be laid in lines or patterns. And similar to the well-known wall modules from Nanoleaf, the panels glow either in white or colorful with 16 million colors. In addition to scene settings in the Nanoleaf app, there is also a way to synchronize the Wi-Fi-controlled modules with music or screens. Matter enthusiasts will need patience, however: The Skylights are not scheduled to hit the market until the 3rd quarter of 2023.\nThe lighting specialist is using the time till then to integrate another technology alongside Matter, which Nanoleaf has been announcing for some time. As Gimmy Chu called it in an interview: a \u201cmore true version of automation that sits in the background while consumers go about their daily routines.\u201d The key to this is called Sense+. Using integrated motion and brightness sensors, Nanoleaf products capture the behavior of people in the room and report that data to a digital assistant called Nala. It analyzes daily routines and makes suggestions in the Nanoleaf app on how to best automate lighting.\nThe sensors can be integrated into luminaires such as the Skylights, but the manufacturer also wants to offer hard-wired light switches or wireless products with them. The assistant sits in a so-called Nala Bridge, which Nanoleaf has designed as a wireless plug with an integrated night light. Via software update, products like the Nanoleaf Shapes, Elements and Lines, which serve as Thread Border Routers, but will also be able to work as Nala bridges. The system will work with all Matter-compatible fixtures. However, the manufacturer holds out the prospect of additional features to users of Nanloeaf products. The always well-informed Jennifer Pattison Tuohy from \u201cThe Verge\u201d has already found out more (link). Again, products with Sense Plus and the Nala function won\u2019t hit the market until the third quarter of 2023 at the earliest.\nSamsung / SmartThings\nTwo seemingly contradictory developments can be observed at Samsung: On the one hand, the company continues its strategy of making the SmartThings Hub disappear as a separate device with power connection. The function moves to other devices. For example, buyers of the new QLED TVs no longer have to connect a USB dongle to control Zigbee or Thread devices. Samsung will build a SmartThings Zigbee & Matter Thread One-Chip Module directly into its devices starting in 2023 (link).\nOn the other hand, the Korean company presented a new hub at CES \u2013 albeit in a special form. The SmartThings Station disguises itself as a wireless charging pad for smartphones, but serves as a Thread Border Router and Zigbee hub at the same time. Only those who want to connect Z-Wave devices still need one of the classic SmartThings hubs from Samsung or Aeotec. A button on the top can be assigned scenes from the SmartThings system. For example, a short press calls up the good-night scenario at bedtime, and a long one raises the shutters in the morning. Unfortunately, only Koreans and Americans will be able to enjoy this clever combination of devices for the moment. The market launch is planned for February 2023 (link).\nSwitchBot\nSwitchBot products like the namesake button push or the SwitchBot Curtain actuator work with Bluetooth. They have always required a hub for smart home integration. The manufacturer is now replacing this hub to make its Bluetooth products Matter-compatible. The SwitchBot Hub 2 is scheduled to receive a corresponding software update in the first quarter of 2023, followed by the SwitchBot Curtain as the first product to \u201cspeak\u201d Matter. According to the manufacturer, further devices will follow during the year \u2013 including the SwitchBot Lock. Other products in the range that use Wi-Fi as radio standard are to be Matter-enabled directly via update. They will function without a bridge in the future.\nTP-Link\nTP-Link has presented 15 products in the new Matter standard for North America. Experience shows that not all of them will find their way into other markets. For example, the form factor of the compact Tapo P125M adapter plug shown is not suitable for European sockets. It is set to be TP-Link\u2019s first Matter product on the U.S. market \u2013 available from January 2023. A wall dimmer called Tapo S505D will follow in March (link). Furthermore in the pipeline: Multi-socket outlets, LED lamps and radiator controllers, some of which require a Matter-certified hub from Tapo. TP-Link also presented it right away in Las Vegas: The Tapo H900 Homebase is supposed to connect devices via Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Thread and other protocols. With its triangular profile, it can also serve as a base for a tablet with control software (picture). A list of all type designations is given on the company website (link).\nYeelight\nYeelight is not the least to show that many Chinese suppliers welcome the Matter standard. The company announced early on that it would open its Bluetooth-based lighting system Yeelight Pro in the direction of Matter. At CES, this commitment from last year was renewed and a software update for the Pro gateway was envisioned for Q2 2023. Luminaires and illuminants of the brand that are registered on the gateway should then also be able to be controlled via Matter ecosystems. In addition, the manufacturer is planning a series of new products that support the standard out of the box.\nThe first representative of this genre will be the Yeelight Cube modular smart lamp. It consists of three different cube types \u2013 Spot, Matrix and Panel. Depending on the combination, they cast directional light (Spot), display pixel graphics (Matrix) or provide a flat, diffuse brightness (Panel). The user can therefore combine his light object as desired. The manufacturer did not yet provide any information on availability.\nShare this information:\nSponsor / Advertising\nSponsor / Advertising\n\u00a92021 - 2024 matter-smarthome.de"

Learn more\nThe best of CES 2024: Here are the products we\u2019re actually excited about\nCES 2024 has come and gone, leaving a wealth of promising TVs, powerful computers and more AI-powered gadgetry than anyone realistically needs in its wake. The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro\nContent creators have a new trick up their sleeves, thanks to Belkin and Apple. While it may look like a mere fancy MagSafe stand at first, the Auto-Tracking Stand Pro is actually your own personal little cameraperson. Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "CES 2023 Highlight Matter Unlocks the Potential of Seamless Smart Home Connectivity for Manufactures\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2023 was buzzing with excitement and innovation, and one topic that stood out as a clear game-changer for the smart home industry was Matter.\nMatter is a new smart home connectivity standard from the Connectivity Standards Alliance (CSA) that enables seamless communication between smart home devices from different manufacturers and platforms.\nOn the CES show floor, several examples of Matter in action were showcased, including plugs and switches from Schneider Electric, an Ayla customer. The implementation of Matter in smart home devices brings a new level of convenience and ease of use for consumers. It is an exciting time for the smart home industry, and forward-thinking device manufacturers have the opportunity to lead the way in this new era of smart home connectivity. Adopting Matter in smart home devices will set device manufacturers apart from the competition and give them a competitive edge in the market.\nMatter is the beginning, not the end\nHere\u2019s some perspective from a November 2022 article, \u201cMatter\u2019s plan to save the smart home,\u201d in The Verge:\n\u201cBefore Matter, compatibility was a huge selling point for devices. You bought a smart lock largely because it worked with your ecosystem of choice. With Matter, that reason should go away. Now, companies will need to innovate on top of the standard to create reasons ... to choose their devices over the competition.\u201d\nIoT expert Stacey Higginbotham's post-CES report highlighted the exciting advancements and new products in the smart home market that support the Matter standard. She encountered several leading companies that have announced plans to offer Matter-compatible products, demonstrating the growing interest and adoption of this new standard.\nHowever, she also encountered major companies in the smart home market that had no Matter plans to announce, and she noted consumer complaints about the lack of Matter support for existing products.\nAs with any new technology, there will be challenges and obstacles for manufacturers to overcome. Retrofitting existing smart home products to support Matter can be a complex process, and manufacturers may also face compatibility issues beyond the domain that Matter handles.\nSolving the challenges of Matter\nThe implementation of Matter in smart home devices requires dealing with various technical aspects such as cloud access, device management, user management, device schedules, support for non-Matter devices, data analytics, and development of apps to control the smart devices. To achieve success in implementing Matter in their products, manufacturers can benefit from using a comprehensive, end-to-end IoT platform like Ayla Networks.\nWith Ayla Networks, manufacturers can easily and cost-effectively transform any device into a Matter-connected product, deliver custom-built, differentiated products that stand out above generic Matter solutions, retain direct access to insights about product usage and customer interaction, enjoy a one-stop shop for Matter devices, firmware, cloud platform, and a 5-star mobile app and ensure that customer and Matter usage data is secure, thanks to the Ayla platform\u2019s management under regional privacy guidelines and laws, free of geopolitical risks.\nAs Stacey Higginbotham said in another post, \u201cFor buyers of Matter gear who start with Matter and stay there, the road to smart home devices will be so easy that Matter will essentially fade into the background, paving the way for companies in 2024 to launch services on top of the gear making its way into more homes.\u201d\nIt won\u2019t happen instantly, but Matter is the future of the smart home. For device manufacturers that want to be at the head of the pack, now is the time to get serious about Matter, or risk being left behind.\nPut your Matter strategy on the right track.\nThe best way to achieve Matter success is to build your smart home products on a comprehensive, proven, and secure IoT platform.

        "raw_content": "CES 2023: Matter \u2014 Unlocking The Smart Home\nEvery year, after recovering from CES, I take a step back and evaluate the most influential IoT technology trends. This year\u2019s winner is Matter, a new industry standard for smart home connectivity with the potential to change the course of consumer electronics (CE) product development. In this post, I won\u2019t review the hundreds of Matter-enabled products announced at CES \u2014 other tech news outlets cover that in detail. Instead, I\u2019ll look at Matter from a business perspective, explaining what it is, why it\u2019s a game-changer for the CE industry, and how it\u2019s becoming an influential design pattern for IoT connectivity in other vertical industries.\u00a0Click here for a more comprehensive analysis of Matter.\nWhat\u2019s Matter?\nToday, most smart homes use a hodgepodge of incompatible products, protocols, and wireless device networks \u2014 Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Thread, Zigbee, Z-Wave, Lutron, Insteon, and others. I use three device networks in my home, connected to half a dozen home automation ecosystems (Alexa, HomeKit, Google, and others). This setup requires 14 smartphone apps, each with unique user IDs and passwords. Matter cleans up this mess by standardizing three things \u2014 Internet Protocol (IP) device networks, a common \u201clanguage\u201d for home automation, and simple, consistent methods for setting up secure devices. I can buy a Matter device from any manufacturer, install it in a few minutes, and use it with any home automation ecosystem.\nIP networking is the key to understanding Matter. Your PC and smartphone don\u2019t care if you\u2019re browsing the Web, watching a video, or sending an email. That\u2019s the miracle of the internet: standard protocols define how to encode and send content-agnostic messages. Over the past 20 years, a patchwork of smart home device ecosystems evolved using many incompatible protocols and wireless networks. Matter unifies device communication by specifying a common \u201clanguage\u201d that works over widely deployed, IP-bearing networks \u2014 Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread. Messages like \u201cTurn on the patio lights\u201d and \u201cWhat\u2019s the temperature setpoint?\u201d are the same for all Matter-enabled lighting controls and thermostats, regardless of manufacturer or network connection. Matter also specifies how devices join home networks, often with a single tap on a smartphone.\nIn addition to specifying a standard smart home application protocol, Matter tests products in independent labs to validate interoperability across all manufacturers. The Matter logo on a product assures consumers that it is compatible with all other Matter-enabled devices and smart home ecosystems. By making connected CE products easy to buy, install, and use, Matter expands the smart home market beyond early adopters and technology enthusiasts to include all homeowners.\nMatter has mass\nThree years ago, some of the biggest brands in consumer electronics (Amazon, Apple, Google, and more than 200 others) agreed that smart home market growth was consistently disappointing, mainly because products from different manufacturers and ecosystems were incompatible. Instead of competing for a bigger slice of a small pie, these companies agreed to join forces and bake a bigger pie.\nTo address the smart home fragmentation problem, the group created \u201cProject Connected Home over IP\u201d (later rebranded \u201cMatter\u201d) under the auspices of the Connectivity Standards Alliance, the home of Ziggee, and other standards. Since then, the working group invested \u201cHundreds of thousands of person-hours\u201d in the effort, according to Tobin Richardson, CEO of the organization. He\u2019s not exaggerating \u2014 the core\u00a0specification\u00a0is more than 1300 pages. Matter 1.0 is now publicly available, over 550 products are certified or in the certification pipeline, and Matter is one of the hottest topics in the global CE industry.\nStandards rarely deliver commercial results quickly or generate much excitement, but Matter is different for two reasons. First, Matter specifies how to implement, use, and validate proven, widely deployed standards and networks rather than creating new technologies. Specifically, Matter builds on Internet Protocols and IP-bearing networks \u2014 the same ones we use on smartphones and PCs. Second, hundreds of the world\u2019s leading CE, cloud services, and semiconductor companies are fully committed to Matter, and many are already shipping products. Although Matter is still a work in progress, it\u2019s on track to become the dominant smart home connectivity framework over the next two or three years.\nMatter has gravity\nAs touched on above, Matter allows products from different manufacturers to connect seamlessly and operate harmoniously over existing Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Thread networks. Thread is an industry-standard mesh network for small, low-power devices, similar in function to Zigbee and Z-Wave. Although Thread is not as well-known as Wi-Fi, it\u2019s already active in many homes because millions of smart speakers, hubs, and other products from Apple, Google, and Amazon already have Thread or will soon get it via a software update.\nFor consumers, Matter simplifies buying, installing, configuring, and using smart home products, resulting in lower adoption barriers and better user experiences. Homeowners can be confident that all Matter devices are compatible with one another and with Matter-enabled home automation platforms from Amazon, Apple, Google, and others.\nIn addition to improving consumer experiences, Matter is a game-changer for the worldwide consumer electronics industry. Defragmenting the smart home market increases product development efficiency, reduces supply chain friction, and removes many barriers to smart home market growth, leading to larger economies of scale.\nMatter ushers in a new era where the entire home is a platform for plug-and-play products that are easier and less costly to build, buy, install, and use. The first wave of Matter products is already shipping, and product availability will accelerate rapidly over the next few years.\nMatter is solid\nEarly adopters of any new technology should expect a rough spot or two. However, early feedback on Matter user experiences is overwhelmingly positive. Good results aren\u2019t surprising, given the thorough testing over the past year by big companies with a lot at stake. The first wave of Matter devices is limited to these seven device categories:\nWe won\u2019t have to wait very long for this list to grow. The Connectivity Standards Alliance plans to release new types of devices on a regular six-month cadence, starting with these categories:\nIf Matter doesn\u2019t yet support a type of device you need, or if you already have smart home devices using an older device connectivity scheme such as Zigbee or Z-Wave, you have two options \u2014 coexistence and bridging.\nCoexistence means using what you already have as you add Matter devices. Most home automation ecosystems can simultaneously support Matter, Z-Wave, Zigbee, and other connectivity schemes, so it\u2019s easy to grow your Matter device collection while still using your old stuff. For example, telling your smart speaker to \u201cTurn on the outside lights\u201d can use Matter, while \u201cTurn up the temperature\u201d can use Zigbee, Z-Wave, or some other application protocol.\nBridging is better than simple coexistence because it brings legacy devices into the Matter world \u2014 and it\u2019s part of the Matter core specification. A Matter bridge is a hub that connects simultaneously to your home IP network and to a legacy device ecosystem using native protocols. The bridge translates Matter messages into the appropriate protocol for the legacy system and vice-versa, enabling device-to-device communication between different device ecosystems. We expect to see Matter bridges for Zigbee, Z-Wave, and other ecosystems in early 2023.\nStarting now, it makes sense to buy Matter devices whenever you can get the required functionality. Use bridges to connect Matter to other device ecosystems such as Zigbee and Z-Wave.\n2023 IoT technology trend predictions\nA year ago, I\u00a0predicted\u00a0that three technology trends would converge to accelerate growth in IoT products:\nThese predictions came true, for the most part. Matter was the star of the show at CES 2023, Matter-optimized\u00a0silicon\u00a0and\u00a0software\u00a0platforms from multiple suppliers streamlined device development, and the growth rate for edge analytics stands at about 22% to 38% per year, depending on the analyst\u2019s level of optimism.\nThese three trends comprise a virtuous cycle \u2014 \u201cThe Matter Effect\u201d \u2014 a positive loop that turbocharges smart home growth. Here\u2019s how it works.\nSmarter, simpler products built on standard platforms reduce friction across the CE marketplace, and the cycle repeats. This is how the smart home market transitions from early adopters to mainstream consumers over the next two or three years.\nThis year, I\u2019m doubling down on Matter. I\u2019ll be closely watching these two embedded technology trends.\nAs long as we regard embedded computing as separate and distinct from mainstream computing, IoT industry growth will continue to disappoint, as it has for the past 10 years. Matter is leading the way to a \u201cmainstream embedded\u201d design pattern based on IP networking with a standardized, industry-specific device \u201clanguage\u201d (commands, attributes, and artifacts), a unified security architecture, and a layered interaction model that defines how components interact.\nStandardizing how embedded devices communicate and interact enables the independent development of device platforms, device applications, and higher-level application services \u2014 similar to how we write software for PCs and smartphones.

The partner representatives spoke about connectivity protocols, smart solutions and shared joint Tuya case studies.\nAlex Yang, Co-Founder and COO of Tuya Smart, hosted the first panel discussion on Matter's ecosystem. Speakers shared how ecosystem players can promote Matter via partnership.\nChris Lapre, Head of Technology of the Connectivity Standards Alliance (the Alliance), said, \"The continuous evolution and upgrading of Matter, the expansion of its application scenarios and new markets are contributed from the collaboration of the Alliance members including smart device manufacturers, security certification enterprises and others. Building and maintaining the Matter ecosystem is also key to the development of Matter. Alliance members like Tuya, play an active and crucial role in the promotion and application of Matter. They will attract more customers to join the Matter ecosystem and innovate Matter from customers' feedback through a variety of real-world implementations.\"\nRob Alexander, Principal Product Manager of Silicon Labs said, \"The market for smart, connected devices holds unprecedented opportunity, but challenges remain. Open standards, like Matter, can help everyone in the industry adopt the same protocols without expensive licensing. Tuya's role is important for global developers. Tuya chose Silicon Labs MG24 SoC as one of the chips, jointly enable customers to quickly get mass production of Matter devices and support consumers to mix and match among ecosystems like some of the ones you'll see today including Amazon, Apple, Google, Samsung, and the countless intelligent, connected devices from locks to lightbulbs and beyond.\"\nKevin Po, Group Product Manager at Google, shared with audiences their recent product updates to support Matter. Now, consumers can use existing Nest devices like the Nest Mini and Nest Hub to control Matter devices, and use Android Fast Pair to setup Matter devices. Moreover, Google will Matter-enable more Nest devices in 2023 and release Google Home App iOS support too. Tuya has been an early access partner with Google Home and will continue working together to grow the Matter vision of interoperability, choice and openness in the home with users and Tuya's partner ecosystem.\n\"If smart devices are to scale, it's crucial that they are secure, reliable and seamless to use,\" said Chloe Ma, VP of China GTM, IoT Line of Business at Arm. \"Standardization will drive the advancement of IoT and we are working closely with the Alliance and partners such as Tuya, to ensure the Arm ecosystem is ready to support developers in building Matter-compliant devices.\"\nLater in the day, Tina Yu, General Manager of Eurasia and North America of Tuya Smart, hosted the second panel discussion on the commercialization of Matter. Speakers shared their thoughts on the future application scenarios of Matter devices. They also talked about the future of intelligent interconnection of consumer electronics.\nJon Harros, Head of Certification and Testing Programs at the Connectivity Standard Alliance first described the blueprint of Matter in 2023, and said, \"People can reach the Alliances' official website, and see there are more than 500 products listed that are either being certified or have been certified by the Alliance. These include a range of products, software components, apps and more. They constitute our 'universe' of Matter applications. As an early participant of Matter, Tuya has been actively promoting the use and implementation of Matter. Its Tuya-enabled hardware ecosystem and development platform will enable more manufacturers to quickly penetrate the smart home and smart device markets, and attract consumers.\"\nJustin Miller, Founder and CEO of CLEANLIFE, said: \"Since our collaboration with Tuya in 2017, Tuya continuously supports us with product development, and they always share us with new ideas and opportunities. This mutual partnership has been extremely beneficial in helping us become an industry leader in smart lighting. Now, Matter gives our brand and products more credibility to be able to work with the prominent brands that are a part of the Alliance through shared interoperability and also allow easier integration with mainstream smart device systems such as Apple Home, Samsung Smart Things, etc. And with Tuya's help, we strongly believe that we can easily and quickly pivot our plans to Matter compatible. We expect Matter to help expedite the path to market and enhance user experience for the whole industry and provide a platform for all 220+ brands in the Alliance to succeed together.\"\nRyan Maurice, CEO of BARDI, said, \"Thanks to our collaboration with Tuya, BARDI has grown very fast. We are at equal playing grounds with other Tuya-enabled brands in Indonesia thus being able to focus on competing in quality of product and service. While Matter joined in, it unlocks the pool of opportunity for BARDI as now the competition is not only on our quality of product and service but also competition on the platform supporting us. Compared with other local brands, our Tuya-enabled devices have a faster response time to voice commands than other platform-enabled devices. Moreover, the accuracy and speed that Tuya's engineering team delivered to us are praiseworthy.

CES is owned and operated by the Consumer Technology Association, otherwise known as CTA for short.\nCTA will organize CES 2024 to include suppliers, producers, and developers in the technology industry. Besides creating an annual event for those in the tech industry, CES also invites business leaders and entrepreneurial thinkers to speak at the annual event to inspire those in the tech industry in the midst of relevant, global issues \u2013 such as climate change and sustainability.\nSome examples of companies in the tech industry that are eligible to attend CES 2024 include companies working in:\n\ud83d\udc49 Specific examples of featured companies set to attend CES 2024 include Amazon, Samsung, Google, Hyundai, Sony, and Panasonic.\nQuick Recap: What is the Tech Industry?\nThe tech industry refers to the wide-variety of companies which develop, create, or sell any kind of electronic devices \u2013\u00a0such as computers, appliances, video games, or software.\nThink of the last time you went to see a movie at the cinema \u2013 have you ever thought twice about how much work goes into creating a production like that? It requires lighting, sound check, several camera angles, and then even more is completed in the editing process \u2013where music, sound effects, and visual aids are added to amplify the viewers' watching experience.\nAll of the steps mentioned all require the same thing to create an end product: technology.\n\ud83d\udc49 A fridge that tells you the temperature of its filtered water, a 3D video game with effects that are all too surreal, or an app that helps you figure out which song is playing in the coffee shop \u2013 are all thanks to technology.\nSince technology is used so widely in today\u2019s society, the tech industry has become an appealing field to study in college and to help graduates find a well-paying job that can also open them to several different career paths. For instance, someone who designs graphics can hop from the world of video games to the world of film with ease.\nHowever, one of the many challenges that companies in the tech industry face is how to adjust their business models to become more environmentally friendly and reduce electricity consumption. This can prove challenging, as the technology developed in these companies often requires extensive amounts of power to execute the trial and error processes necessary to acquire the end product to be put on the market.\nWhile this process is important for the final product, the tech industry is known to be energy intensive and to leave a large carbon footprint behind \u2013 raising the question of how these companies can alter their activities in technological advancements while still maintaining the state of the environment and preventing further pollution.\n\ud83d\udc49 This is why CES 2024 can prove beneficial, as CES 2024 can step in and help to provide companies in the tech industry with new ideas on how to implement sustainability into their business models.\nWhat is sustainability?\nSustainability is the effort made to achieve the same end goal without the use of finite resources or putting the planet in more environmental danger. Sustainability is often best understood when discussing the three pillars of sustainability \u2013 which include economic sustainability, social sustainability, and environmental sustainability.\n\ud83d\udc49 Any business, including those in the tech industry set to attend CES 2024, should seek to make progress in all three pillars of sustainability in order to achieve maximum success in their business. All three pillars of sustainability are important for any business looking to achieve long-term success.\nWhy does sustainability matter for the tech industry and CES 2023?\nFor instance, the transportation industry accounts for over a quarter of emissions emissions in the U.S. \u2013 holding responsible for 28% of greenhouse gas emissions produced in 2021. If a sector like the transportation industry were to reduce their annual emissions by even something as small as five percent \u2013 it would help the nation as a whole to reduce their carbon footprint.\n\ud83d\udc49 The same goes for the tech industry, and it remains even more imperative as their impact is on a more colossal, global scale.\nThink of it this way: it takes an enormous amount of technology to manufacture and continue powering the operations of many new vehicles. Those fancy new cars that have completely eschewed the need for a key have made use of technology. The bluetooth connection that allows phones and maps to be synced with car systems makes use of technology. The beeping sound your two front mirrors make if you\u2019re about to hit someone uses technology.\nIt\u2019s true that the tech industry isn\u2019t doing as much damage as industries like oil, gas, or electricity. However, the biggest reason why tech should recognize their importance in implementing sustainability is because of their impact across all other industries.\nSeveral operations integrated into many items we use in our daily lives, such as cars or phones, make use of technology. In fact, even after the CTA shared their upcoming estimations for prediction for consumer sales in technology in the U.S. \u2013 they continued to raise their predictions in order to surpass previous U.S. consumer spending records on technology.\nEven more so, more and more Americans are favoring remote work following the pandemic \u2013 spiking another uptick in the use of technology on a frequent basis. Therefore, seeing as so many items make use of products, business models, and services provided by companies in the tech industry \u2013 it is fair to say that the tech industry has the potential to help other industries reduce their emissions and create a ripple effect of environmental change and newfound awareness towards the importance of sustainability.\n\ud83d\udc49 CES 2024 has the opportunity to help companies in the tech industry get a jump start on the inspiration they need to incorporate new sustainability tactics into their business models.\nHave previous CES events been successful in encouraging the importance of sustainability?\nAlthough CES consistently takes place every year in January, whether previous CES events have been successful or resulted in any key progress for tech companies that have attended in the past is often subjective.\nCES 2024, or the Consumer Electronics Shows of 2024 \u2013 is expected to draw in over 130,000 people, meaning its potential to impact a large audience is viable. However, many argue that events like CES 2024 are nothing more than a grown up version of \u201cshow-and-tell\u201d where new companies can reveal their latest products to guests \u2013 many of which will attend CES for the sole purpose of discovering the latest technology about to be released.\nNevertheless, CES deserves credit for its strategic timing and operations \u2013 seeing as winter allows potential business partners to purchase products in bulk at a reduced price following the price surges in the fall and winter during the holiday season. This could be viewed as one of the biggest pros for tech professionals to attend CES 2024, as deals like this may only be presented whilst attending a CES event.\nAnother benefit of CES events is that allows distributors to receive live feedback from others in the tech industry on the product before it hits the market. In turn, just as this feedback is helpful for the company seeking outside expertise \u2013 it is also beneficial for the tech professionals who attend a CES event, so that they can determine which ideas they would like to use for their own upcoming products and services.\n\ud83d\udc49 Many products shown at CES events will pertain to other avenues dedicated towards sustainability, such as health and sports technology like smart workout machines or fitness bands.\nUltimately, it\u2019s difficult to measure the success of an event like CES 2023. However, while it\u2019s difficult to determine if CES 2024 will help influence tech companies to be more sustainable, there\u2019s one thing for sure \u2013 events like CES 2024 can\u2019t hurt.\nWhat about Greenly?\nIf reading this article about CES 2024 and why sustainability matters for the tech industry has made you interested in reducing your carbon emissions to further fight against climate change \u2013 Greenly can help you!\nIf you\u2019re trying to determine if an event like CES 2024 is worthwhile for your company to attend, but can\u2019t decide!
