It is reported that this conference is aimed at promoting the high-quality development of the shared energy storage power industry, closely focusing on the theme of \"win-win future for all in the year of the rabbit\", and jointly with authoritative experts in the industry and outside the industry, industry elites, technology giants, and key customers, to conduct in-depth exchanges and discussions on the hot topics such as the opportunity of the era of energy storage power, and the promotion of industrial upgrading by technological transformation. Besiter Chief Executive Officer Pan Liangchun, Vice President of Research and Development Dong Xinhua, Vice President of Commerce Wang Likun and other major leaders attended the global conference, attended the ceremony and delivered important speeches with heavyweight guests: \"Stand together at the age of the venture and open a new subdivided circuit of shared energy storage power.\"\nThis conference not only successfully publicized Besiter's first new product of shared energy storage power supply in the world, but also won wide recognition and praise from insiders and insiders.\nAs early as 2021, the China Development and Reform Commission and the China Energy Administration officially issued the Guiding Opinions on Accelerating the Development of New Energy Storage , clarifying the independent market dominant position of new energy storage, and making specific plans for the installed scale of new energy storage. Besiter, as an advanced solution provider of shared energy storage power supply in the industry, actively responded to the call of the government, fully implemented the national strategy, relied on scientific research to deepen the subdivision of the shared energy storage power supply circuit, continued to consolidate the product innovation and brand influence, and achieved a stage victory.\nFigure 1\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7987/157691_05ec0f3ef4b43866_001full.jpg\nAt the expert round-table forum of the conference, the guests discussed \"whether the shared energy storage power supply is a golden opportunity\", \"whether the Besiter shared energy storage power supply can continue the glory of the shared charging bank 10 years ago\" and other issues. Many authoritative experts in the industry said: Besiter's shared energy storage power supply has three advantages: multiple advantages, economic advantages, and win-win mode. The first is more efficient dispatching operation, more controllable safety and quality, and more prominent economic benefits. The second is the large-scale procurement of energy storage equipment and construction to reduce the initial investment pressure and future operational risks. The third is the sustainable commercial operation path, stable sharing of energy storage revenue sources, and will achieve win-win efficiency mode. The following conclusions are drawn from data and industry cases: The shared energy storage power supply is in the era of rapid development. In the future, it will continue to share the brilliant achievements of the power bank 10 years ago, and continue to create a new model and charm.\nBesiter's new products of global shared energy storage power supply can achieve a win-win situation by building a closed-loop ecological development circle. Consumers can enjoy convenient and easy-to-use energy storage power, saving money, time and cost.\nIn addition to setting up leaders' speeches and round-table forums, the global press conference also opened up a special question and answer channel for journalists. Besiter's responsible person explained in detail the questions of many media reporters on the spot. Besiter's precise industry insight, as well as its strong confidence and confidence in R&D products, stems from the strong strength of this shared energy storage power supply.\nBesiter Chairman Pan Liangchun said: \"Besiter has established an altruistic outlook on life and determined the corporate mission of altruistic culture. While pursuing the material and spiritual well-being of all Besiters, we provide high-quality products and services for customers, and make contributions to the popularization and convenience of shared charging for mankind. We hope to make changes in the subdivided field of shared energy storage charging, so that the charging cost of the common people is as cheap as drinking water, and everyone can afford it. So we take the lead in breaking through the mutually beneficial business model of realizing rental income through personal purchase. With the help of Besiter sharing platform, consumers can not only meet their own needs, but also supply idle resources to others' needs, and potentially earn rental fees from it. \"\nFigure 2\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7987/157691_05ec0f3ef4b43866_002full.jpg\nWang Likun, Vice President of Besiter Business, believes that: \"In recent years, the demand for convenient energy storage products in the world has been vigorous.

With only a blueprint and no framework to follow or only ideas and no samples to learn from, you can only feel your way across the river. Everything depends on the deep technical accumulation of the R&D team, combined with various pain points of traditional products, to conceive new products, innovate design, carefully polish, repeatedly test and continuously improve. After several years and thousands of tests, the world's first new product was finally presented to the public confidently. \"\nFigure 4\nTo view an enhanced version of this graphic, please visit:\nhttps://images.newsfilecorp.com/files/7987/157691_05ec0f3ef4b43866_004full.jpg\n2023 is the first year to fully implement the spirit of the 20th CPC National Congress.
