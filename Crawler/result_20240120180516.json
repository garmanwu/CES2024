        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Solar-powered headphones, city car and rooftop tent shine bright in Las Vegas\nSolar-powered devices and gadgets are making massive strides for a more sustainable future. Here is our pick of those turning heads at CES 2024.\nSustainability is, as ever, an increasingly dominant theme at all technology conferences, and the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) this year is no different.\nBut rather than just electric vehicles (EVs) on display, as well as hydrogen offerings, solar power also demonstrated its prowess in Las Vegas.\nHere is how solar energy stole the show.\nAmbient Photonics: Constant power to indoor and outdoor electronics\nThe US start-up Ambient Photonics showed off its new solar cell, which can provide constant power from indoor and ambient outdoor light, which the company says can deliver three times more power than existing technologies.\nThe tech could be used to replace billions of batteries in home gadgets, like TV remotes and wireless keyboards.\n\"Batteries are dead and indoor light is the future power source for billions of connected devices,\" the company said.\n\"Ambient photonics cells are built for real-world, low-light applications. They use revolutionary new molecules and manufacturing processes to harness indoor and outdoor ambient light and create an endless power source\".\nPowerfoyle: Solar-powered headphones\nThe Swedish clean technology start-up Exeger unveiled its new solar cell technology, which uses a light material to convert all types of light, even ambient light, into energy.\nThe material, called Powerfoyle, is the world's only fully customisable solar cell and it can be used in almost everything.\nExeger partnered with Adidas and Philips to deliver solar-powered headphones, which use the solar material on the headband and you never need to charge.\nThe company even made a stylish bag made of Powerfoyle, which can charge devices when put inside. The bag is not available for purchase but shows the potential of what the technology can do.\nThe Swedish company also showed off a powerful ear protector in a pair of headphones in its partnership with 3M.\nIt works using solar cells on the headband and is useful for those working in noisy environments, such as oil rigs and construction sites. It costs around \u20ac700, the company said.\n\"The perception of available energy is changing, how by light. It is everywhere and it is around us and we\u2019re dependent on that,\" Exeger founder Giovanni Fili told Euronews Next.\n\"And now we\u2019re going to use it to power our devices too. So this is a big year for Exeger\".\nThe Squad: Solar-powered city car\nWhile no one has cracked designing a car powered entirely by solar, one company from the Netherlands is offering a promising alternative.\nThe Squad, a solar city car by Squad Mobility, costs only around \u20ac8,500 and is a very compact car to drive in cities.\nIt can drive around 30 km a day in a sunny city like Las Vegas without needing a charge but also uses electric energy.\nThis is particularly useful if you live in cities with fewer hours of sunlight; in these places, the car can drive about 22 km without needing to be charged.\n\"In Holland, the winter is pretty bad for solar energy, so in winter you, you have to charge now and then, and in the summer you probably don't have to,\" Robert Hoevers, CEO and co-founder of Squad Mobility told Euronews Next.\nThe compact car weighs 350 kg and can reach speeds of 40 km/h.\n\"We get a lot of requests from food delivery companies servicing repair companies and medical companies that are looking for inner city mobility solutions for easy parking and easy charging,\" said Hoevers.\nJackery: The solar rooftop tent\nCalifornian solar company Jackery unveiled its Solar Generator Rooftop Tent and, as the name suggests, it looks like it could be used on another planet.\nIt is an automatic sunflower-shaped solar tracker with 600 W retractable solar wings that fits onto your car.\nThe idea is that if you spend time off the road, you can harness the power of the Sun to power up your coffee-making devices, air fryers, microwave ovens, and so on.\nYou can also turn it into a tent after you fold away the solar panels.\nYou can get up to 1,000 W of solar power per day, according to Jackery.\n\"It's more to help with the off-road lifestyle. Companies don't have the technology to create a fully solar-powered car yet. But right now, this is for an off-grid lifestyle,\" Kevin Chen, content manager at Jackery told Euronews Next.\nThe product is a concept for the moment, but Jackery says it could go into production at the end of this year.\nYou might also like\nAn iPhone survived a 4,500-metre fall from a plane intact.

The land is currently undeveloped, and the filings don\u2019t detail how many buildings the company would be looking to construct. The commission is due to meet to discuss the proposal later this week.\nThe application was submitted by DuPont co-founder Lammot J. du Pont and Vizsla Ventures LLC and includes references to a company known as Vu Ventures LLC. However, a now-removed internal company magazine from engineering firm Gordon Inc. -- which is featured in the planning documents as involved in the project -- notes the connection between the Dulles Berry project and CloudHQ.\nAs part of the original 2018 proposal for data centers on the site \u2013 seemingly filed by an affiliate of QTS \u2013 the owners dedicated a 100-foot wide corridor along the eastern boundary line of the Property immediately adjacent to the Board Run to the county.\nPlans for a Dulles Berry campus have seemingly been in the works since around 2018, according to other filings with the county; it has undergone several revisions involving the site's visual and environmental impacts.
