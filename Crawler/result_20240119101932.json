Here\u2019s how it works.\nMy favorite thing at CES 2024 is the eVTOL Flying Car \u2014 you've got to see this thing transform\nIt's like a real-life Autobot\nSince I got a kick out of playing with Transformers as a kid, I couldn't help but get a pang of nostalgia and futuristic excitement all wrapped into one as I came across the Xpeng Aeroht booth at CES 2024.\nThis supercar concept doubles as a flying car, thanks to propellers that emerge from the back of the vehicle. The eVTOL Flying Car is designed to allow for \"effortless navigation through congested areas and obstacles when conditions permit.\" The last part of that sentence is doing some heavy lifting there, but I at least love the concept of being able to avoid that traffic jam by soaring above it.\nXpeng Aeroht, which claims to be the largest flying car company in Asia, says its eVTOL Flying Car addresses the demand for short-distance, low altitude travel. Speaking of low, the propellers don't sit that much higher than the vehicle itself, so you definitely don't want to have a passenger hop in after this thing starts spinning.\nWhile this flying car didn't fly at CES, the company did demonstrate how the the vehicle opens is arms, which is supposed to facilitate vertical take-offs and landings \u2014 just like the best drones.\nThe whole process wasn't exactly quick, but I was mesmerized as the propellers raised from the back of the supercar and then spread out. They even spun slightly as if to tease the audience.\nInside the eVTOL Flying Car is a dual-mode cockpit that seats two. Sorry, no room for the entire family \u2014 the flying components take up too much room. And there's a both a square steeling wheel/yoke and a joystick for controlling the vehicle.\nAs reported by The Sun, co-founder, vice president, and chief designer of Xpeng Aeroht, Wang Tan, said that, \"Everybody wants to fly actually and to have another view, another angle, to see the gorgeous view.\"\nTan also said that users will be able to beat traffic and fly out of congestion zones. Given the mess that is our air traffic control system \u2014 not to mention how many crashes on see on my NJ to NYC commute during a given week \u2014 I don't know how far away this dream is.

[Courtesy: XPeng AeroHT]\nAt this week\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 in Las Vegas, it was a Chinese company that stole the show with a pair of outlandish concepts that it terms \u201cflying cars,\u201d though the use of the term stretches the definition for one of them.\nManufacturer XPeng AeroHT, a subsidiary of Chinese automaker XPeng Motors, unveiled its \u201cLand Aircraft Carrier,\u201d a lunar rover-looking vehicle that actually consists of two vehicles: a ground module and an air module that deploys from the ground module for flight. The company said customers will be able to preorder the vehicle in the fourth quarter of this year, with deliveries starting in late 2025.\nAlso at CES, AeroHT made the international debut of its electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) flying supercar concept, demonstrating the aircraft outside China for the first time. Production and delivery of that model will happen after the Land Aircraft Carrier takes flight, the firm predicted in October.\nBilled as \u201cthe most powerful tech event in the world,\u201d CES is an annual U.S. trade show that offers a forum for groundbreaking technology built by companies worldwide. All sorts of mind-blowing innovations were featured at the event. But AeroHT\u2019s eccentric Land Aircraft Carrier may have taken the cake.\nAnnounced in October, the design looks a bit like Tesla\u2019s recently unveiled Cybertruck, with sharp lines and a sleek exterior. But stowed in its rear is a drone-like aircraft, which users could theoretically deploy and fly in a variety of settings.\nThe Land Aircraft Carrier is a two-part design, with an air module for vertical takeoff and low-altitude flight and a ground module for driving and storage of the compact aircraft. In addition to personal use, AeroHT envisions the vehicle being used for public services such as emergency rescue.\nThough the final design is still under development, the \u201cmodular flying car,\u201d as the company describes it, already features a futuristic, \u201ccybermechanical\u201d exterior. According to AeroHT, all key tests in the vehicle\u2019s research and development validation phase are complete, and it is in the \u201cpreparation stage\u201d for mass production.\nThe vehicle\u2019s ground module is built for four to five passengers, driving on six wheels and three axles. That configuration enables 6\u00d76 all-wheel drive and rear-wheel steering. In addition, an extended-range electric powertrain can be used to recharge the air module on the road.\nThe vehicle\u2019s aerial component is fully electric, designed for a pilot and one passenger. It includes both manual and automatic driving modes, AeroHT said, as well as a 270-degree cockpit window for a wide field of view. And fortunately, getting it ready to fly is anything but a hassle.\n\u201cThe automated system streamlines the separation and combination of the air and ground modules just like the Transformers [action figures], making flying more accessible and extending the user\u2019s travel experience from the ground to the sky,\u201d AeroHT said in a previous release.\nThe air module uses distributed electric propulsion to meet single point of failure safety requirements. Should one of its six rotors fail, the aircraft\u2019s flight control system will automatically make adjustments, allowing it to fly safely even with only four propellers spinning. In addition, AeroHT in October tested a multi-parachute rescue system, which can be deployed at altitudes as low as 50 meters agl.\nAeroHT this week also showcased its latest eVTOL flying car concept to an international crowd for the first time. The design, described as a supercar, was revealed in October alongside the Land Aircraft Carrier. CES attendees were treated to a live demonstration of its transition from land to flight mode.\nUnder development for more than two years, AeroHT\u2019s flying supercar builds on the company\u2019s early prototypes.\nOn the road, the vehicle really does look just like a car\u2014its flying components, such as manipulator arms and rotor systems, are folded and stored inside the vehicle in land mode. Those parts unfurl in flight mode, allowing the supercar to take off and land vertically. An \u201cintelligent cockpit\u201d discerns between the two modes, adapting components such as the steering wheel or dashboard based on the user\u2019s selection.\n\u201cThis functionality allows for intuitive navigation through congested areas and obstacles when conditions permit, effectively addressing the demand for short-distance, low-altitude travel,\u201d AeroHT said.\nThe implication there is that users, when faced with traffic, will be able to switch to flight mode and bypass it through the air. That contrasts with other flying car designs that intend to limit takeoffs and landings exclusively to airfields, such as Aska\u2019s A5.\nIn 2022, AeroHT tested a flying supercar prototype weighing about two tons. The company said mass production will follow as soon as policy, regulations, and application scenarios \u201cbecome more mature.\u201d\nThat day may be fast approaching. By AeroHT\u2019s estimate, Chinese state and local authorities in the first half of 2023 released more than 120 policies related to the low-altitude economy, China\u2019s equivalent to the FAA\u2019s advanced air mobility (AAM) moniker. These include strategies such as the Outline for the Development of Green Aviation Manufacturing (2023-2035) and plans to set aside dedicated airspace for low-altitude operations.\nChina predicts the low-altitude economy will add hundreds of billions of dollars to its national output in the coming years. The industry kicked off in earnest with the first commercial electric air taxi flight in December, completed by manufacturer EHang.\nElectric air taxis have not yet launched in the U.S., though the initial cohort of aircraft is expected to enter service in 2025. However, personal eVTOL designs, such as Pivotal\u2019s Helix, are now beginning to hit the U.S. market.\nThere are also several U.S. firms billing themselves as \u2018flying car\u2019 manufacturers, and AeroHT could present some competition. In addition to Aska, Oregon-based Samson Sky is developing the Switchblade flying sports car, while California-based Alef Aeronautics is building the Model A drive-and-fly vehicle.\nAlef intends to open vehicle sales in 2025, while Aska and Samson Sky have not yet announced entry into service dates.\nLike this story?

        "raw_content": "This flying car at CES is something you need to see\nCES 2024 attendees this week couldn't help but notice a spectacular flying car concept screaming for attention on the convention floor: the Xpeng AeroHT eVTOL Flying Car.\nIs this mean machine created by Guangzhou Xiaopeng Motors Technology Co., Ltd. (also known as Xpeng) about to whiz around the skies of American cities? That's not at all clear, but it was there, and boy was it cool.\nXpeng's secret weapon for commanding attention seems to have been a sort of attainable narrative about how this thing could fit into the life of an actual (probably very rich) human being. Let's not abuse the term \"practical\" here, but it makes more sense than your average flying car concept or personal eVTOL. With the propeller arms folded in, someone can drive it around in the normal manner, or at least as \"normal\" as driving a Lamborghini-style supercar EV gets. And when the driver hits traffic, they can open up the flying apparatus and take to the skies \u2014 local aviation regulations permitting.\nPlus, the drone-style eVTOL propeller orientation suggests that piloting this flying car would be relatively simple, unlike other car-aircraft transformer concepts from the recent past, like the Klein Vision Air Car, which starts out as a car, and essentially turns into a plane. That seems like a blast for fully instrument-rated pilots, but not so much for average slobs like me.\nDid CES play host to this beast's first public flight? Not so much \u2014 it remained on terra firma for the duration. What's more, it's not immediately clear that Xpeng has even finished the \"concept\" part of this project. \"Xpeng AeroHT\" is the name of the company division, and \"eVTOL\" is an industry term that means \"electric vertical takeoff and landing.\" That means this thing's name is ultimately just \"Flying Car.\"\nBut that doesn't mean the exhibit wasn't an impressive display of tech imagination and engineering bravado. It's certainly not for nothing that attendees witnessed those propellers folding up and disappearing into the roof of the car right there on the convention floor:\nWhat might something like this cost? How could it ever be legal? When will it be available? These are questions for another time. The more important question this week in Vegas was, gee whiz, did you just see that?\nTopics\nCES\nElectric Vehicles"

The eVTOL flying car is designed for future three-dimensional transportation, with the company proceeding to mass production once related policy, regulation and application scenarios become more mature.\n\u201cXPENG MOTORS is at the heart of a revolution in mobility,\u201d said Dr. Brian Hongdi GU, Vice Chairman and President, XPENG MOTORS. \u201cThe future of mobility goes beyond cars. Whether people want to travel by cars, air or other ways, we aspire to change what\u2019s possible.\u201d\n\u201cIn 2013, we started AEROHT, dreaming of flying cars,\u201d said Tan WANG, co-founder, XPENG AEROHT. \u201cFast forward to 2024, and that dream has become a reality. Today, we're thrilled to unveil our two latest innovations which will take everyday folks from driving on roads to soaring through the sky.

        "raw_content": "XPeng AeroHT\u2019s \u2018modular flying car\u2019 will enter mass production, pre-orders begin in Q4\nDuring a press event held during CES in Las Vegas, XPeng\u2019s electric aviation business arm AeroHT shared new details regarding two of its \u201cflying cars.\u201d In addition to live demonstrations of its eVTOL flying supercar, XPeng AeroHT shared that its modular \u201cLand Aircraft Carrier\u201d will enter mass production.\nAeroHT is an eVTOL-focused entity of XPeng Inc., majority-owned by the company and its founder He Xiaopeng. Since 2013, AeroHT has conducted tens of thousands of safe flights en route to developing and implementing electric flying vehicles at scale.\nIts mobility sibling, XPeng Motors, has delivered some impressive technology in its own right, but many would argue that AeroHT\u2019s technology is even more exciting. During XPeng\u2019s annual 1024 Tech Day event in 2022, AeroHT introduced its seventh generation flying car. Others have used that term loosely, but this prototype is a genuine EV that drives, deploys propellers, and can take off into the sky.\n2023\u2019s Tech Day brought the debut of two new \u201cflying car\u201d designs, including a revamped version of the flying supercar mentioned above. New to the AeroHT family was a 6\u00d76 all-wheel drive EV that houses an eVTOL aircraft in its rear. That vehicle has come to be known as the \u201cLand Aircraft Carrier,\u201d and according to news from XPeng and AeroHT in Vegas today, will enter mass production in 2025.\nXPeng AeroHT\u2019s flying car carrier to begin pre-orders in Q4\nDuring a press event held live at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, XPeng AeroHT shared significant updates on the progress of its \u201cflying car\u201d technology. First, the Land Aircraft Carrier in the featured image above has been slotted for scaled production in 2025.\nBefore then, however, the company will open pre-orders for the modular EV/ eVTOL combo beginning in Q4 of this year. Described by its makers as \u201cnot another mere concept,\u201d AeroHT shared that the Land Aircraft Carrier has already completed all necessary tests during its R&D validation phase and has now begun the preparation stage for mass production.\nWhile XPeng AeroHT states the final design of the \u201cflying car\u201d is still in development, it should feature the following specs if and when scaled production begins:\nDespite pre-orders in the pipeline, XPeng AeroHT is not sharing precisely what its Land Aircraft Carrier \u201cflying car\u201d will cost. XPeng founder He Xiaopeng said the carrier would be priced in the RMB 1 million segment ($140,500). We will learn more concrete pricing once the company debuts its final design.\nIn addition, the scaled production of the eVTOL carrier, XPeng AeroHT, also wowed the CES crowd with its international debut and a live demonstration of its flying supercar. The EV transitioned into flight mode \u2013 deploying its rotor-equipped arms before completing a successful vertical takeoff and landing.\nWhen XPeng AeroHT introduced the sixth generation of the flying car during 1024 Tech Day 2021, it was expected to arrive sometime in 2024 and cost less than RMB 1,000,000 (~$156,600). However, that no longer seems to be the targeted arrival as the electric aviation arm\u2019s production focus appears set on the Land Aircraft Carrier, at least for now.\nThat isn\u2019t to say we won\u2019t see this genuine flying EV reach production someday, and given today\u2019s live demo, it appears more feasible than ever. For now, however, our sights are set on Q4 2024, when Land Aircraft Carrier pre-orders begin.\nFTC: We use income earning auto affiliate links.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: China EV maker Xpeng accepts pre-orders for flying car but notes urban use is far off\nThe company\u2019s subsidiary AeroHT presented two types of flying cars at CES 2024 in Las Vegas on Tuesday. Its modular Land Aircraft Carrier will start taking pre-orders in the fourth quarter this year, with deliveries to start a year later. The sportier AeroHT eVTOL (electric vertical take-off and landing) car made its international debut at the show, having previously conducted flying tests in China.\nThere is no information on pricing or availability for the AeroHT, which has propellers that pop out of the back. It has been demoed for flying in China, but it did not take flight at CES. Brian Gu Hongdi, vice-chairman and president of Xpeng, suggested it could launch before regulations are in place for city use, but that people could eventually buy one and fly it in areas where the use of aircraft is not regulated.\nHisense and TCL push AI in TVs, chase industry trends like smart cars\n\u201cThe design of our vehicles is not targeted for urban transportation \u2026 [which] requires an extensive regulatory approval process,\u201d Gu said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re targeting a consumer market, for people to first enjoy the experience of flying and then obviously with the regulatory framework in place, we gradually can move towards urban transportation.\u201d\nWhile Gu said it was too early to say what pricing might be, he expects it to be \u201csimilar to buying a luxury performance car\u201d.\nXpeng distanced itself from the EHang comparison, saying its products are different and target different buyers. The EV company, which made its debut at CES two years after EHang with its first car, noted that EHang\u2019s products are just aerial vehicles without the ability to be driven on roads. EHang is also targeting enterprise use, while Xpeng is targeting a wider consumer base.\n\u201cWe are targeting the consumer market, which is very different,\u201d Gu said. \u201cI don\u2019t see another company that\u2019s doing that right now.\u201d\nWhile Xpeng has also highlighted how the Land Aircraft Carrier could be used for public services like emergency rescue, the new eVTOL car is a more stylish option that can conceal its rotors. This will presumably make it more appealing for people to buy, whenever it becomes available, even if they cannot fly it to work every morning.\nAI to dominate CES 2024, with glasses for blind, shoes to walk faster\nGu said the company is already in talks with regulators in China but international expansion \u201ctakes time\u201d.\nXpeng\u2019s ambitions could face some challenges with current geopolitical tensions, though. Chinese drone tech has been caught in the cross hairs before. Washington put DJI, the world\u2019s largest consumer drone maker, on its Entity List that bars US companies from doing business with it without express approval.\nWhen asked whether this could present some hurdles, Gu said, \u201cI\u2019m not even thinking about that right now \u2026 This business is purely focused on the China market right now.\u201d"

This year, the XPENG AEROHT Low-Altitude Air Mobility Explorer is demanding the attention of George Jetson fans everywhere.\nYou may not have heard of XPENG but this is the great thing about CES \u2013 we get to see the brands behind the brands. XPENG is exactly this type of brand. Engineers at heart, the team at XPENG are at the pointy end of behind-the-scenes electric vehicle manufacturing.

Think less James Bond style flying Aston Martin and more Hilux ute with a drone on the tray.\nDetails of exactly how it works are limited but is basically a regular car carrying an enormous drone. This might sound strange, but in the case of the XPENG AEROHT it is beautifully and fully integrated.\nThe realities of personal drone transport are tricky to get your head around. Ultimately, I really doubt the flying car concept will ever get off the ground, literally! Instead, enjoy it for what it is \u2013 an engineering showcase.\nAs a concept, it is a lot of fun.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Flying Cars, Artificial Intelligence, and Parallel Parking\nThese things should solve all our transportation problems.\n2024 started off with a bang at CES, a show that has become by default the biggest car show of the year. Even though General Motors, Ford, and Stellantis\u2014the former Big 3\u2014all skipped the event this year, eager, tech-talking contenders from Germany, Japan, China, Vietnam, and Korea all showed up ready to innovate.\nSome of the tech we saw was pure pie-in-the-sky, and you couldn\u2019t help but think some companies were just using CES to raise money for projects that will never come. Other projects that were presented, even from long-established, successful carmakers, seemed like they were just too cool to ever see mass production.\nBut some of what we saw might make its way into our future everyday lives. So, let us consider the Best of CES for 2024. And the worst. Which was which? We report, you decide.\nVarious Flying Contraptions\nThe so-called \u201cFlying Car\u201d has more or less gone away, given over to various multi-nacelle pod thingies of various funding and/or provenance.\nLeading the flock is surely the Hyundai Supernal S-A2, which promises seating for five, a cruising speed of 120 mph, and 20 to 40 miles of range. Lift and forward movement will come from eight \u201call-tilting rotors.\u201d And it will be powered by electricity alone, eliminating emissions and cutting noise down to what Hyundai promises will match that of a dishwasher. Look for them in the skies over your city by 2028, shuttling the lucky few over traffic at 1500 feet.\nThere were many other intriguing contraptions. The Helix eVTOL seats one, offers eight rotors (but can still fly on six), an eight-kWh battery good for a range of 20 miles (\u201cor more\u201d) and a parachute in case things go horribly wrong. Prices start at $190,000. Also: Made in the USA!\nThe Xpeng Aeroht Ground Module and Air Module need to be in a Bond movie.\nChinese carmaker Xpeng has an aviation subsidiary called Xpeng AeroHT. AeroHT introduced two different flying phenomena at CES. One is a cool six-wheeled megavan called the Ground Module that is similar (in my memory) to the 1992 Italdesign Columbus concept (but you\u2019d have to be real old to remember that).\nThe Ground Module carries inside it a five-seater flying phone booth called the Air Module. The latter retreats from the former and off it flies. So cool. It can fly autonomously if no one has a helicopter license. Customers in China will get these by the end of the year, Xpeng says. We might get it sometime, but no plans were announced.\nSecond, XPENG AeroHT also showed off the eVTOL flying supercar. Xpeng says the flying supercar has \u201cthe driving experience of a supercar, but can transition effortlessly from land to flight mode, allowing drivers to take to the air.\u201d Looks like eight rotors with two on each of its four arms. The arms fold in for supercar duty, flip out for flight. No indication how many it seats, looks like at least two. Xpeng says it successfully test-flew a two-ton prototype in Dubai in 2022.\nThe Increasing Presence of AI\nThere is no hard-and-fast, legally binding definition of artificial intelligence. Saying a product is driven by AI is like saying something\u2019s \u201corganic,\u201d or \u201cworld-reknowned!\u201d Thus, the term has been exploited by some startups eager to draw in investors who don\u2019t know that AI isn\u2019t always A or even I.\n\u201cArtificial intelligence is a machine\u2019s ability to perform the cognitive functions we usually associate with human minds,\u201d says consulting firm McKinsey & Co.\nGenerally, AI is helpful. So while you may be right that Mark Zuckerberg wants to control your brain, AI could just as easily make driving, and many things associated with driving, easier and safer, like directing you to your favorite taco stands with an EV charging station outside that are on the route you\u2019re already taking.\nWhile every entity that could crank out a press release claimed to have \u201cgroundbreaking advances in AI,\u201d let\u2019s look at AI-enabled advancements from Marelli, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, and BMW at CES.\nGlobal component supplier Marelli showed its \u201cSoftware-Defined Interior,\u201d the next-gen version of its HorizonView pillar-to-pillar display. It supports up to four \u201cZone Control Units\u201d that can each be personalized by vehicle occupants. In addition, a holographic display hosts Marelli\u2019s \u201cVirtual Assistant\u201d (one of many so-named features from carmakers at CES this year). It\u2019s an advanced human-machine interface that Marelli says \u201cacts as an in-vehicle co-pilot, creating a unique driving experience and transforming the interaction between the car and its occupants.\u201d It looks cool in the photo.\nVolkswagen partnered with Cerence to bring Chat GPt to all MEB and MQB models later this year: That includess all the ID EVs, as well as the Tiguan, Passat, and Golf.\n\u201cThe IDA voice assistant can be used, for example, to control the infotainment, navigation, and air conditioning, or to answer general knowledge questions,\u201d VW said. \u201cIn the future, AI will (be) enriching conversations, clearing up questions, interacting in intuitive language, receiving vehicle-specific information, and much more\u2014purely hands-free.\nBMW has partenered with Amazon for its Alexa Large Language Model, which will \u201cenable human-like interactions and dialogues.\u201d BMW says to look for improvements with the next generation of the BMW Intelligent Personal Assistant, over the course of the year in vehicles with BMW Operating System 9.\nMercedes used the North American debut of its Concept CLA to show the next step up for its MBUX Virtual Assistant. The new system will offer helpful suggestions based on learned behavior and situational context in a new, more natural voice that even has \u201cempathy\u201d (a German first!).\nThe dialogue will be accompanied by visual feedback in the form of a colored shape made of advanced 3D graphics from the Unity game engine. In the new MBUX Virtual Assistant, a so-called \u2018living\u2019 star avatar \u201cuses animations to express different moods and states of being.\u201d Hug me, Gunther!\nSony Honda Mobility Afeela, Again!\nSony Honda Mobility, the joint venture between two corporate giants, drove its AFEELA prototype onto a Las Vegas stage using only a Sony Playstation 5 controller. That part was just for show\u2014you won\u2019t be able to drive your car using a PlayStation 5 controller. The car is pretty much the same as what debuted at CES in 2023.\nIt can operate at Level 3 autonomy in certain conditions and \u201cLevel 2+\u201d the rest of the time, which will give you time to play video games on your PlayStation 5 and watch movies using Sony RIDEVU, which plays movies in your car. Perhaps you should watch the Sony movie Gran Turismo. Look for pre-orders of the AFEELA next year and deliveries in 2026, SHM said.\nMobion Crazy Concept Car from Hyundai\nHate parallel parking? Check this out.\nThere have been versions of something like this before, from that black-and-white film from the 1930s of the car with the spare tire that drops down from the trunk to help slide the rear of the vehicle into a parking space, to the GMC Hummer EV doing parlor tricks in a dirt lot. The problem with high articulation of wheels is that the wheels are often attached to suspension links and drive shafts.\nHyundai\u2019s parts group Mobis made this party trick of an Ioniq 5 EV by incorporating hub motors at all four wheels, freeing up each wheel from any normal links. Thus, each wheel can rotate 90 degrees and spin in either direction. This not only makes parallel parking a breeze, it makes you the king\u2014or queen\u2014of the street takeover.\nAnd, Finally\u2026\nMoonwalkers are like strap-on six-wheeled roller skates powered by AI and electric motors. Specifically, according to maker Shift Robotics, they are \u201crobotic shoes that use AI software to measure a user\u2019s stride 100 times a second, thus enabling each shoe to adjust to the gait cycle of each individual, thereby maximizing safety, enjoyment, and performance while walking.\u201d\nEach step you take is multiplied 3x by the rollers. Because the wheels move only when you do, Shift Robotics assures us they are safe, and numerous demos suggested as much. The suggested use is to improve the productivity of warehouse workers, but you can use them for whatever you want.\nPrice? Only $1400.
