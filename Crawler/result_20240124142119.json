        "raw_content": "NEWS\nH+K - A story 50 years in the making\nH+K International is a leading supplier of stainless steel kitchen equipment to the food service industry. We provide total restaurant solutions, incorporating manufacturing, logistics, after sales service and project management with over 1,600 employees world-wide with operations in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, China, Indonesia, Ireland, Japan, Mainland Europe, Mexico, Middle East, New Zealand & South Africa.\nThe H+K story started in Canada in 1971 initially as a small company called Modular Architectural Components. In 1975 Bill Griffiths, a contractor of McDonald\u2019s bought the company and renamed it to \u201cH+K Equipment\u201d, standing for \u201cHospital & Kitchen Equipment\u201d.\u00a0 Three years later, McDonald's wanted to expand into Europe in 1978, at a time when a McDonald's restaurant was something of a rarity in Europe. Importing kitchen equipment from North America wasn't an attractive prospect, so McDonald\u2019s offered Bill an opportunity.\nA couple of his people went to London and scouted the surrounding area. Then the IDA (Industrial Development Agency in Ireland) heard about their search and went into overdrive, bringing them across to Dublin and offering support if they set up in Ireland. Thus, a small factory was established in Ballyfermot (Dublin region) employing around 50 people and fabricating complete stainless steel kitchen packages for McDonald's in Europe.\nInitially the U.S. market was supplied from Canada and in 1981 a production facility was set up in Dallas, Texas to support the growing demand in North America.\nWith the European increase in activity, especially in the United Kingdom, H+K set up a plant in Rugby in June 1986 in central UK, which quickly became H+K's main European production facility.\nIn 1991, McDonald\u2019s once again was moving into a new market in Latin America and H+K decided to set up a plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico the same year. This location had multiple advantages, proximity to the US, low cost, well-situated to support Latin America...and many more.\nH+K has always been very proactive in looking at ways to better serve our customers and in 1998 the company purchased Norwood Motor Electric & Supply Company, Inc. outside of Detroit which specialized in resupply smallwares activity.\u00a0 It was later renamed H+K Norwood and is now H+K Resupply which moved from the Detroit area in 2013 and is now based in Aurora outside Chicago with 40 employees.\nIn 1999, nearly 24 years after supplying the first kitchen in Canada, H+K was asked by McDonald's to look at setting up an operation base in Australia to support their expansion. It has been a great success and today the Australian company in Sydney employs 70 people and has been utilized as our centralized headquarters for our Asia Pacific market.\nIn 2002 Brian Ranalow, CEO led a management buyout which resulted in an exit from the Griffiths family. This buyout allowed the distribution of ownership to the senior management group which was mainly Dublin-based. David Bobbett succeeded Brian Ranalow as CEO and following further restructuring of the ownership over the next few years, David became the majority shareholder.\nThe Mexican production facility has proven to be a great success and in 2007, in line with the forecasted expansion plans of our customers, H+K decided to increase the manufacturing capacity and the plant was expanded. San Luis Potosi continues to offer a great level of flexibility for global operations.\nHKI Online, the online smallwares, spare parts & equipment ecommerce platform was launched in 2009 and allows customers to browse & order 24/7.\u00a0 Also, H+K's online project management tool followed shortly, originally known as IPM, Integrated Project Management, and it is now widely used for rollouts and allows fast and seamless execution of projects.\nOver the years H+K has always looked at ways to innovate, not only in fabrication of the equipment but also in the overall support and business management fields. eTech, a custom-built software package, was developed to manage all aspects of reactive & planned service repairs events in restaurants.\nIn 2010 at the request and in partnership with McDonald\u2019s due to significant expansion plans in Asia, H+K setup distribution facilities in Beijing, China and shortly thereafter a distribution facility in Osaka, Japan.\nIn 2014 the European team migrated the Rugby logistic and distribution center to a new 12,000 sqm location in anticipation of business growth in Europe.\nIn 2016, following significant growth in the Asia Pacific region, H+K purchased a manufacturing facility in Jakarta, Indonesia. Following significant investment & training, this facility now proudly services the Asia Pacific region with quality fabrication and minimal freight times. This same year H+K also purchased LAUK, a leading UK lighting design and supply company who specialise in creating lighting solutions for the UK Restaurant and Retail sectors.\nIn 2019, Deloitte & McDonald\u2019s selected H+K as the sole KES for all of Japan. H+K is also very proud to have received numerous awards over the years for our global performance in recognition of the hard work, excellence, and dedication of the H+K employees.\nStarting from humble beginnings in Canada in 1971 H+K has grown, to:\nH+K takes pride in providing exceptional customer service to all our customers on a global level. We continue to support and expand our international customers and through our core strengths, including focus, flexibility, and innovation we will exceed our customers\u2019 expectations and deliver to meet their ever changing needs.\nH+K'S Business Combines Manufacturing & Logistics\nBased on our customers\u2019 increased needs we are utilizing the Integrated Project Management model to actively develop new competencies in areas of field data collection and in the creation of architectural engineering drawings. This in turn translates into site execution while monitoring suppliers manufacturing schedules and influencing their inventory management. This extended role is particularly valuable in more mature markets with significant numbers of rebuilds and relocations.\nNavigation\n\u00a9 2021 H+K International\nFooter\nCommon links"

Founded in Canada in 1975, they've grown exponentially, now having a significant global presence in the UK, US, China, Ireland, Mexico, and Australia. H+K appliances are found in restaurant chains such as McDonald's, Subway, and hundreds of others.\nFor 12 years, Icreon has been H+K's trusted partner, providing innovative digital solutions that have streamlined operations, accelerated their online shopping program, enabled more efficient order management for employees, and ultimately fueled H+K's growth.\nTransformation Towards Omnichannel Retailing\nThe Challenge: Updating Legacy Systems and Enhancing Customer Service\nH+K International had an outdated ordering process that was slowing their ability to grow. Despite having online ordering available, their outdated online ordering experience and legacy ERP system was causing the majority of their clients to make orders over the phone. The company decided to enhance their online ordering process and overall digital experience to encourage customers to make online orders. After a competitive RFP, Icreon emerged as their digital partner.\nThe Solution: Building an Enterprise Omnichannel Retail Experience\nTo overcome these challenges, H+K collaborated with Icreon. Icreon\u2019s team\u00a0 \u00a0worked closely with H+K to modernize the outdated ERP system, which contained huge volumes of product data, with the latest tech stack. This massive database migration helped the company run their backend operations flawlessly. Along with scaling the capacity of the underlying backend system with new technology upgrades, Icreon developed a web-based enterprise solution that allowed H+K staff to manage clients, maintain product catalogs, manage inventory, and process orders received more efficiently than ever before. Icreon provided H+K with the right digital tools and custom automations in areas like freight management, enabling them to process orders faster, with less steps, and an improved accuracy of orders delivery.\nSimultaneously, Icreon expanded H+K\u2019s digital capabilties by creating an online storfront, which is available in 9 languages, enabling them to extend and respond to the increased demand. The digital storefront was equipped with a comprehensive reporting engine, offering H+K better insights into their products and client behavior. Icreon helped H+K transition to multiple payment solutions and introduced recurring orders, that triggered personalized messaging making it easier for clients to reorder and increased sales.\nLeveraging machine learning, the b2b ecommerce website enhanced product search accuracy, delivered personalized user experiences, and introduced a user-friendly one-click quick order feature.\nThe Result: H+K's Remarkable Operational Improvement and Enhanced Shopping Experience\nIcreon transformed H+K International's outdated ERP system and built an online storefront to improve the ordering process and driving a significant increase in online orders. With enhanced user-friendliness and a streamlined digital experience, customers now prefer online orders which resulting in reduced operating costs and an significant increase in incremental revenue.\nMaking Online Order Processing Convenient through Handheld Devices\nThe Challenge: Beyond WiFi: Streamlining Online Orders in a Diverse Digital Landscape\nH+K International was confronted with another obstacle.\nA considerable number of H+K\u2019s retail locations not only lacked WiFi, but also lacked access to an online portal where employees could place orders for customers. This lack of\u00a0 a digital expereince for customers visiting H+K\u2019s retail locations resulted in missed sales and lost revenue. H+K saw this as a chance to unlock new revenue. To overcome these challenges, they wanted to provide an order portal for retail employees, ensuring that all their stores could place customer orders quickly and efficiently. They also wanted to optimize the mobile experience for customers visting thier retail locations, helping customers understand thier solutions, make buying decisions, and easily place orders. This vision lead to an omni-channel experience, enabling customers to transition seamlessly between web experiences and moble apps and different devices, from desktop to mobile to tablet, without loosing thier personalized customer journeys or shooping cart information.\nThe Solution: Delivering Seamless Mobile Ordering Experiences\nTo achieve these ambitious goals, H+K partnered with Icreon to develop a seamless mobile ordering experience. Acknowledging the global variations in smartphone and tablet usage, as well as differing download speeds across stores, Icreon engineered robust and high-performing mobile and tablet apps capable of delivering optimal performance even on lower cellular connections like 3G and Lite. The collaboration led to a user-friendly, efficient, and accessible platform that enables H+K's client store users to place, reorder, or add parts to an exsiting order with just a few taps.\nOn the digital business optimization front, Icreon utilized advanced APIs to construct a seamless data exchange between the newly developed mobile apps and H+K's robust enterprise system. This step was critical, as it fostered an environment of interconnectedness that directly translated to streamlined operations. The integration simplified the ordering process, making it smoother and more efficient. In essence, it was the digital equivalent of greasing the gears, ensuring that all interal operations moved in harmony to enhance user experience. Regular maintenance and updates are carried out on these native apps, ensuring they remain up-to-date with the backend system and providing users with the best possible ordering experience.\nThe Result: Enhanced Customer Experience and Business Growth\nThe implementation of this solution brought significant improvements. Not only did it extend online ordering capabilities to all stores, but it also streamlined the ordering process, resulting in quicker and more efficient transactions. Introducing the omni-channel experience ensured customers could switch between devices seamlessly without loosing thier personalized experience. Since the implementation of the new solution, hundreds of thousands customers are now using smartphones and tablets for their online orders. This drove a 50% increase in online orders.\nIcreon initiated the modernization of H+K's legacy systems with a comprehensive enterprise architecture strategy. This strategy aimed to streamline operations and set the stage for a web-based enterprise solution. This solution optimized client management, product cataloging, inventory control, and order processing.\nIcreon crafted a sophisticated, web-based enterprise solution to optimize product catalog management, inventory tracking, and order processing. This innovation streamlined H+K's internal backend operations, ensuring faster, more accurate online order processing.\nIcreon expanded H+K's digital capabilities by creating a multilingual online storefront to accomodate increased customer demand. It included a robust reporting engine, multiple payment methods, recurring orders and machine learning-powered product searches, simplifying and improving the shopping experience.\nIcreon developed robust, high-performing mobile and tablet apps that enabled H+K's client store users to order or reorder parts swiftly and efficiently, even under lower cellular connections.
