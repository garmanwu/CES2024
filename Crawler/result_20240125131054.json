        "raw_content": "News\n15 March 2023\nLight-powered Eco-Drive models with a new movement -\n365 days of running time powered by clean energy\nNew Eco-Drive 365 models with innovative new designs\nIn an era of environmental change and diversifying values, CITIZEN Watch aims to offer an even more enjoyable experience of time to even more people around the world. As part of these efforts, CITIZEN has developed the new Caliber E365 Eco-Drive*1 movement (Cal. E365) featuring a running time of 365 days on a full charge. These three new Eco-Drive 365 models offer fresh, new interpretations of designs from the CITIZEN Design Archive along with the new Cal. E365 movement. All three models, including a limited-edition model, will be released in Fall/Winter 2023 as part of CITIZEN\u2019s Global Collection.\n* Price and launch date may be subject to change.\nCITIZEN Eco-Drive 365/BN1015-52E\nEco-Drive watches for everyone, everywhere\nThe light of the sun shines down equally on everyone, no matter where we are in the world. This light is freely available to all and powers all of CITIZEN\u2019s Eco-Drive watches, perfectly encapsulating CITIZEN\u2019s corporate philosophy of \u201cLoved by citizens, working for citizens.\u201d\nIn the early 1970s, the world was in the midst of an energy crisis, and the engineers at CITIZEN looked to sunlight as an innovative, non-polluting clean energy source. This was the genesis of Eco-Drive, grounded in CITIZEN\u2019s determination to provide the world with environmentally-friendly watches that do not need regular battery replacement. The world\u2019s first light-powered analog watch was launched in 1976. Since the launch of this groundbreaking model, CITIZEN has continued to pioneer light-powered watch technologies, advancing them to the point where even small amounts of light can be converted into electricity to power Eco-Drive watches. CITIZEN has also worked to enhance the functionality and aesthetic appeal of each subsequent Eco-Drive model, and Eco-Drive watches are now worn by people in 140 countries and regions around the world.\nOur world is changing rapidly as we face a range of environmental issues including climate change and natural disasters, and our values and ways of thinking are becoming more diverse. CITIZEN is adding these new Eco-Drive 365 models to its global line-up to emphasize the appeal of Eco-Drive watches powered by clean energy to everyone who wants to build a brighter future.\nUniquely beautiful, innovative new designs\nThe Cal. E365 movement inside these Eco-Drive 365 models further enhances the advantages of CITIZEN\u2019s proprietary Eco-Drive - low power consumption and long running times - allowing each watch to run for 365 days on a full charge. The movement maintains the standard 27 mm diameter with even higher power generation efficiency. The pulses used to move the hands have also been refined to allow new and exciting design possibilities.\nThe designs of the watches are inspired by a quartz watch model with an eye-catching original design launched by CITIZEN in 1973. This iconic design from half a century ago was carefully studied, adapted, and given a fresh, new interpretation. The iconic lines of the new case utilize CITIZEN\u2019s stainless steel processing and polishing know-how. The dial, used to generate power for the watch, has also been updated using the latest manufacturing techniques. The limited-edition model features lab-grown rubies*2, echoing back to the indices of the original 1973 design. The leather strap is produced by an LWG-certified*3 tanner. After 50 years, CITIZEN\u2019s iconic 1973 quartz model has been reborn as an Eco-Drive watch, reflecting new potential and evolutionary possibilities for watches in a new era.\n\u25a0 Regular Models\nThe BN1015-52E offers a modern, streamlined look with an all-black color scheme, and the BN1014-55E features the distinctive silver tones of stainless steel.\nThe stainless steel case of these distinctive models combines clean, straight lines and flat surfaces with ridgelines at 12 and 6 o\u2019clock that integrate smoothly with the lines of the bracelet.\nThe latest manufacturing techniques were used to create the sparkling dial that generates power for the watch. Four types of glittering accents with different colors and sizes were combined to create a surface inspired by an endless starry sky and the innate beauty of our planet. The metal indices are located on the outer ring rather than the dial to give the dial surface a sense of depth and breadth. The vertical lines on the case are accented by the stylish facets on each side and the sleek brass hands.\n\u25a0Limited-edition Model\nThe visually appealing ridges of the unique case, the ruby red indices on the eye-catching dial, and the leather strap hark back to the distinctive look of the CITIZEN Quartz EFA, released in 1973. The indices are accented by four CRESCENT VERT*4 lab-grown rubies. Each gemstone has superior purity and transparency and a vivid red color with a slightly purplish hue shared by the finest natural rubies. The strap uses LWG-certified leather.\nAfter 50 years, CITIZEN\u2019s iconic 1973 quartz model has been reborn as an Eco-Drive watch, reflecting new potential and evolutionary possibilities for watches in a new era.\n<About CITIZEN>\nCITIZEN WATCH is a true manufacture d'horlogerie with the capabilities to carry out the entire watch manufacturing process in-house, from creating a watch\u2019s individual components to its final assembly. The company operates in more than 140 countries around the world. Since its founding in 1918, CITIZEN has held the belief of \u201cBetter Starts Now\u201d \u2014 that is, no matter who you are and what you do, it is always possible to make something better, and now is the time to start doing it. Sharing this belief, we have made watches, invented and improved technologies and explored the future of watches such as our proprietary light-powered Eco-Drive technology.\nMore Information\nCITIZEN New Product Announcement\nEco-Drive 365\nCopyright Citizen Watch Co., Ltd.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "News\n10 June 2020\nCITIZEN announces a limited-edition model commemorating\nits 50th anniversary of titanium technology\nCITIZEN celebrates its 50th anniversary this year of the release of the world's first titanium watch. In commemoration, the company announces the new SATELLITE WAVE GPS F950 \u2014 CITIZEN Titanium Technology 50th Anniversary Limited Model \u2014 a testament to its superior titanium processing technology.\nCITIZENTitanium Technology 50th AnniversaryLimited Model\nSATELLITE WAVE GPS F950CC4025-82E\n[Overview]\nTitanium was the favored construction material used in the Apollo spacecrafts in the 1960s due to its lightweight and rust-resistant properties. The material is also uniquely biocompatible and less likely to cause metal allergy reactions to the human body. CITIZEN quickly realized the potential of the material for a new generation of watches, and created the X-8 Chronometer model in 1970, which became the world\u2019s first titanium watch. While titanium material offers many advantages in watch construction, the metal is prone to stick to the mold when subject to pressure of a hundred or more tons, resulting in deformation, and has a softer surface than stainless steel which is easily scratched.\nIn 2000, CITIZEN overcame these challenges by developing Super Titanium\u2122*1 \u2013 its own surface treatment and titanium processing technologies that offered nearly five times the surface hardness of stainless steel and smooth, mirror-like finish.\nMarking the 50th anniversary since the release of the world\u2019s first titanium watch, CITIZEN proudly announces the 50th Anniversary Model of CITIZEN Titanium Technology as a culmination of titanium innovation.\n[CITIZEN Titanium Technology 50th Anniversary Limited Model]\nThis model inherits the \u201cspace\" design concept of the \"SATELLITE WAVE F100\" released in 2014 and \"SATELLITE WAVE GPS F900\" in 2015, respectively, while making full use of CITIZEN's exclusive titanium-processing technologies to further advance innovation. The case and band feature pronounced three-dimensional surfaces with edgy, straight lines that create a symmetrical profile shape of angles and shadows. The black dial comprises a multi-layered structure with six parts stacked on top of one another, evoking the image of the endless depths of outer space. The case conveys a sense of refinement by combining two parts from CITIZEN's unique surface hardening technology, \"Duratect*2 DLC\" and \"Duratect Sakura Pink\u201d.\nCaliber F950 is featured in this top-of-the-line movement Eco-Drive GPS SATELLITE WAVE*3. With reception of exclusive time signal, this advanced movement has the ability to receive GPS satellite signals at the world's fastest speed of within 3 seconds, and offers remarkably fast watch hand movements through a high-speed twin-coil motor that\u2019s capable of rotating the second hand 360\u00b0 forward or reverse in a single second. This unprecedented speed streamlines the process from reception to completion seamlessly.\n[Main features]\n\"Space\" design theme\nThe new model utilizes SuperTitanium\u2122, which is the same material that will be used in Japan\u2019s\nlunar exploration project, \u201cHAKUTO-R*4\". While inheriting the design concept \"Space\" from the 2014 SATELLITE WAVE F100 and the 2015 SATELLITE WAVE GPS F900, the new design idea is further advanced through the use of CITIZEN\u2019s proprietary titanium processing technologies to create a multi-layer, six-part stacked dial that envisions the depth of the endless universe.\nEdgy, linear design lines for case and band\nCentering on CITIZEN\u2019s titanium-processing technology cultivated and advanced over decades, the case and band feature edgy, straight lines that form a three-dimensional surface, creating a stunning sculpted shape of angles and shadows.\nCohesive color combination inspired by Duratect\nRepresenting the 50th anniversary of the world\u2019s first titanium watch, the new F950 model features a combination of Duratect DLC and Sakura Pink that produces a cultivated finish. The dual-case structure is the result of precision processing technologies developed over decades of innovation.\nEquipped with top-of-the-line movement F950 of Eco-Drive GPS SATELLITE WAVE\nCal.F950 is the top-of-the-line Eco-Drive GPS SATELLITE WAVE movement using light as a power source and an innovative satellite reception technology that was pioneered by CITIZEN. With exclusive reception of time data, this advanced movement has the ability to receive GPS satellite signals at the world's fastest speed of within 3 seconds, and offers remarkably fast watch hand movements through a high-speed twin-coil motor that\u2019s capable of rotating second hand 360\u00b0 forward or reverse in a single second. This unprecedented speed streamlines the process from reception to completion seamlessly.\n[Product specifications]\n[History of titanium watches]\n1970 - World\u2019s first titanium wristwatch releasedX-8 chronometer\nThe world's first titanium watch used titanium with a purity of 99.6% for the case. The \u201cX-8\u201d product name comes from a combination of \u201cx\u201d signifying the \u201cunknown\u201d and \u201c8\u201d, the infinite symbol of \u201c\u221e\u201d turned sideways to portray infinite possibilities of titanium.\n1987 New technology development with soft brillianceATTESA first model released\nThe first model \"ATTESA\" elevated the texture of titanium to a new level. Known to be difficult to polish to a mirror-like shine, titanium metal is normally used for outdoor watches for a rough, matte surface texture look. ATTESA is the first genuine business watch to introduce the new surface treatment process that creates a refined, polished look with a beautiful luster. It is also hypo-allergic.\n2000 Birth of Super Titanium\u2122ASPEC World Time\nThe first model to use Super Titanium\u2122, which utilizes CITIZEN's proprietary surface-hardening technology \u201cDuratect\u201d.\n2006 First model to adopt dual-surface hardening technology \"Duratect MRK + DLC\"Promaster Eco-Drive radio-controlled watch\nThis is the first model to adopt \"Duratect MRK + DLC\", which is made by applying \"Duratect MRK\" to harden the surface of the material itself and then overlaying \"Duratect DLC\" to coat the surface with low-temperature plasma technology. This combination results in reinforced durability that\u2019s highly resistant to scratches. It is also hypo-allergic.\n2018: Super-thin 3.53 mm model using Super Titanium\u2122Eco-Drive One\nThis model features Eco-Drive \u2014 CITIZEN\u2019s light-powered technology with the world\u2019s thinnest movement of only 1.00 mm thickness \u2014 housed in a Super Titanium\u2122 case just 3.53 mm in total. Despite being ultra-thin, Super Titanium\u2122 achieves remarkable durability and robustness required for watches.\n[SuperTitanium\u2122 characteristics]\nSuper Titanium\u2122 is the amalgamation of CITIZEN's original titanium-processing and Duratect surface-hardening technology.\n1.\tResistant to scratches\nFive times the hardness of stainless steel, Super Titanium\u2122 is highly resistant to scratches that may occur during daily wear, and continues to retain its original brilliant luster even after 10 years of usage.\n2.\tLightweight\nWeighing only 60% of stainless steel, the material is surprisingly lightweight and feels like a part of your body, allowing you to wear it all day long without fatigue or stress.\n3.\tGentle on the skin\nTitanium is a metal-allergy-resistant material that is gentle on the skin. By applying proprietary surface-hardening technologies instead of traditional metal-coating technologies, all of titanium\u2019s inherent positive qualities are brought to life.\n4.\tRust-resistant\nSuper Titanium\u2122 will not rust from contact with fresh water, seawater, or sweat. Since there is no worry about rust or loss of its natural shine, outdoor enthusiasts and wearers who work with water can use it with peace of mind.\n5.\tRich color variations\nUnlike untreated titanium, Super Titanium\u2122 enables the creation of a wide variety of color tones such as silver, black, gold, and even pink gold. The design possibilities for watches are now virtually infinite.\n<About CITIZEN WATCH>\nCITIZEN WATCH is a true manufacture d'horlogerie with a comprehensive manufacturing process that extends from creating a watch\u2019s individual components to its final assembly. The company operates in more than 140 countries and regions around the world.

CITIZEN L watches\nare at the forefront of sustainable manufacturing, and the new models to be released from the signature\nAMBILUNA collection convey the message that human beings are one with nature. The designs of the four new\nmodels are inspired by the Four Elements \u2013 Earth, Water, Fire, and Air \u2013 reflecting the beauty\nof our planet and its ability to give life to countless plants and animals.\nThe design process for these new models was supervised by biologist Dr. Shin-Ichi Fukuoka. The\ndesigns incorporate biomimicry - lessons learned from the structures of living things and the beauty of\nnature \u2013 to create even better watches that are both aesthetically appealing and comfortable to wear.\nThe lightweight and comfortable knitted watch band dissipates sweat easily thanks to a design\nthat mimics the porous structure of sea sponges. The band incorporates a polyester material called\nECOPET\u00ae*4 made from recycled clothing and plastic bottles. Bands are knitted using\nWHOLEGARMENT\u00ae*5, producing a hand-washable fabric with a porous structure that delivers\nsuperior stretch and durability.\nThe innovative dials feature a new technology called structural color ink*6, developed by FUJIFILM Corporation, which recreates the structural\ncoloration phenomenon seen on the wings of Morpho butterflies and other animal species. The colors on the\nwatch dials are not printed with conventional pigments - they only appear when light is reflected by the\nmicrostructures on the surface, creating a breathtaking array of colors on the dial.\nThese new models will be released to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the CITIZEN L brand of\nsustainable watches.\u3000Each model integrates lessons learned from nature, reflecting the incredible natural\nstructures and beauty found on our planet.\n[Product Features]\n\u25a0Four sustainable watches inspired by Earth, Water, Fire, and Air\nThe signature AMBILUNA collection from the CITIZEN L brand incorporates a sustainable\napproach to manufacturing.

The colors appear when microstructures reflect specific\nwavelengths of light. The effect is produced by structural inks developed by Fujifilm, and this is the\nfirst time that this special ink has been used in the watch industry. The innovative watch dials, which\nproduce colors when light is reflected by the surface, were developed jointly by Fujifilm and CITIZEN.\nEach model expresses one of the Four Elements \u2013 the bounty of the earth (EM1003-48X), the flow of\ncool water (EM1005-42L), the sun emerging from the horizon (EM1007-47E), and a refreshing breeze\n(EM1006-40A) The watches keep time with the power of light and the dials reflect light to produce an\narray of beautiful colors found in nature. All models feature lab-grown diamonds*8 on the dial. The limited-edition global model has additional special\nfeatures including four lab-grown diamonds as well as a gold accent at the 10 o\u2019clock position to\ncelebrate the 10th anniversary of CITIZEN L.\n- Knitted watch band that mimics the porous structure of sea\nsponges\nThe bands incorporate a polyester material called ECOPET\u00ae\nmade from recycled clothing and used plastic bottles, and they are knitted using WHOLEGARMENT\u00ae.\nWHOLEGARMENT\u00ae\nis seam-free to eliminate waste from fabric cutting, thereby minimizing the amount of yarn used in this\nenvironmentally-conscious product.
