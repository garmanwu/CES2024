Here's what they have to say.\nSamuel Teh, Co-Founder of Plasma Science Pte Ltd (Trident Air):\n1. From your perspective, what technology trend has made the biggest impact in 2023, and why?\nWe are Plasma Science, an air specialist company which works with scientists and engineers and we produce Trident Air. For 2023, I have noticed that the tech trend which has made the biggest impact in our industry is the advancement in air filtration and purifiers. In the 90s, there were ionic, then came HEPA, and now, Trident's 'Safe Air Dome' technology. Covid-19 pandemic raised people's awareness of the importance of having safe and clean air. While Trident was developed in the midst of the pandemic in 2021 to prevent the spread of Covid-19, it has been improving the lives of many people by very effectively relieving other health issues such as rhinitis, sinusitis, allergies, and other respiratory diseases.\n2. What are your bold predictions for 2024? What tech trends and innovations should we keep an eye on, and why?\nIn 2024. I predict that more and more commercial buildings will adopt air purifiers in the workplace. The past few weeks have seen Covid cases rising again, thus it is essential to continuously maintain safe, hygienic, and healthy practices whether at home or the office, and nothing is as important as the very air that we breathe.\nBe a part of our growing community of experts and insiders.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here's what they have to say.\nSamuel Teh, Co-Founder of Plasma Science Pte Ltd (Trident Air):\n1. From your perspective, what technology trend has made the biggest impact in 2023, and why?\nWe are Plasma Science, an air specialist company which works with scientists and engineers and we produce Trident Air. For 2023, I have noticed that the tech trend which has made the biggest impact in our industry is the advancement in air filtration and purifiers. In the 90s, there were ionic, then came HEPA, and now, Trident's 'Safe Air Dome' technology. Covid-19 pandemic raised people's awareness of the importance of having safe and clean air. While Trident was developed in the midst of the pandemic in 2021 to prevent the spread of Covid-19, it has been improving the lives of many people by very effectively relieving other health issues such as rhinitis, sinusitis, allergies, and other respiratory diseases.\n2. What are your bold predictions for 2024? What tech trends and innovations should we keep an eye on, and why?\nIn 2024. I predict that more and more commercial buildings will adopt air purifiers in the workplace. The past few weeks have seen Covid cases rising again, thus it is essential to continuously maintain safe, hygienic, and healthy practices whether at home or the office, and nothing is as important as the very air that we breathe.\nBe a part of our growing community of experts and insiders.

        "score": 0.92875,
        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Here's what they have to say.\nSamuel Teh, Co-Founder of Plasma Science Pte Ltd (Trident Air):\n1. From your perspective, what technology trend has made the biggest impact in 2023, and why?\nWe are Plasma Science, an air specialist company which works with scientists and engineers and we produce Trident Air. For 2023, I have noticed that the tech trend which has made the biggest impact in our industry is the advancement in air filtration and purifiers. In the 90s, there were ionic, then came HEPA, and now, Trident's 'Safe Air Dome' technology. Covid-19 pandemic raised people's awareness of the importance of having safe and clean air. While Trident was developed in the midst of the pandemic in 2021 to prevent the spread of Covid-19, it has been improving the lives of many people by very effectively relieving other health issues such as rhinitis, sinusitis, allergies, and other respiratory diseases.\n2. What are your bold predictions for 2024? What tech trends and innovations should we keep an eye on, and why?\nIn 2024. I predict that more and more commercial buildings will adopt air purifiers in the workplace. The past few weeks have seen Covid cases rising again, thus it is essential to continuously maintain safe, hygienic, and healthy practices whether at home or the office, and nothing is as important as the very air that we breathe.\nBe a part of our growing community of experts and insiders.

(right). (Images: Plasma Science)\nSINGAPORE: Technology which can eliminate bacteria and viruses and which was developed in collaboration with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) has been launched in a series of air sanitisers.\nThe sanitisers, which were launched by Singapore firm Plasma Science, use so-called Safe Air Dome Technology.\n\"Safe Air Dome technology combines the triple killing action of cold plasma ions, advanced graphene electrostatic plates, and built-in ultraviolet-C,\" Plasma Science, which is an A*STAR spinoff, said in a media release earlier this month.\n\"It also captured and destroyed volatile organic compounds, allergens, odour, aerosol and dust,\" the company said, adding that typical air purifiers in the market are mainly designed to remove only dust and allergens.\nDr Ady Suwardi, Project Lead Scientist at A*STAR\u2019s Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, said that scientific studies were conducted in collaboration with Plasma Science and Temasek Foundation to prove that the technology worked. \u201cWe look forward to contributing to better public health outcomes and minimising the risks of transmission with the availability of such disinfection technologies,\" he added.\nThe air sanitisers, named the Trident series, underwent trials at CTF@Expo and at the social impact hub at Temasek Shophouse in Dhoby Ghaut, said Plasma Science.

        "raw_content": "techcoffeehouse.com\nPlasma Science launches first air sanitiser series featuring \u2018Safe Air Dome\u2019 technology\nMark Ko\nA*STAR spinoff Plasma Science Pte. Ltd. announced today the launch of its Trident series of air sanitisers, an innovative line up of products that creates a \u2019Safe Air Dome\u2019 environment for users.\nThe revolutionary \u2018Safe Air Dome\u2019 technology is developed in Singapore by Plasma Science, in collaboration with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research\u2019s (A*STAR) Institute of Materials Research and Engineering (IMRE), and partners.\n\u2018Safe Air Dome\u2019 technology combines the triple killing action of cold plasma ions, advanced graphene electrostatic plates, and built-in ultraviolet-C (UVC). In tests done by IMRE, Trident\u2019s cold plasma emitter effectively eliminated\u00a0viruses (including the family of coronaviruses) and bacteria by up to 99.8% in 15 minutes, and up to 99.99% in 30 minutes.[1]\u00a0It also captured and destroyed volatile organic compounds, allergens, odour, aerosol, and dust.\nIn contrast to typical air purifiers in the market which are mainly designed to remove dust and allergens only, Trident is optimised to disinfect bacterial, viral, and other microbial species and remove aerosols in the air fast enough to effectively prevent the transmission of infections. Additional unique features include large area coverage, high air change frequency, low power consumption and easy maintenance.\nSSW, which has been a partner in the Temasek Foundation\uff0as BYOBclean sanitiser campaign, was instrumental in forging the partnership with researchers from IMRE working on electrostatic technologies, and Redbox Global Solutions, a local company developing solutions based on cold plasma technology, to form Plasma Science.\u00a0Through Temasek Foundation,\u00a0the Trident systems have undergone\u00a0trials at CTF@Expo and at social impact hub at Temasek Shophouse to improve indoor air quality. Trident systems have also been deployed at Ren Ci hospital and Teo Heng Family KTVs.\nMr. Samuel Teh, CEO & Co-founder of Plasma Science Pte. Ltd., said:\u00a0\u201cPlasma Science\u2019s Trident series will provide homes, communities, and workplaces with superior protection through healthier environment and safer air. Our locally designed and developed Trident range of products was conceptualised to enable users to work, play and live in a healthy and safe environment, while staying well and \u2018COVID ready\u2019 as it becomes endemic.\u201d\nDr. Ady Suwardi, Project Lead Scientist, Institute of Materials Research and Engineering, A*STAR, said: \u201cFor the \u2018Safe Air Dome\u2019 technology, we optimised the design and spacing between the electrostatic plates as well as the airflow speed, for optimal air cleaning. Scientific studies were conducted in collaboration with Plasma Science and Temasek Foundation\u00a0to prove the efficacy of the solutions developed. We look forward to contributing to better public health outcomes and minimising the risks of transmission with the availability of such disinfection technologies.\u201d\nGaps in the current air purifier market\nThe Trident series currently comes in two different models \u2013 MINI and PLUS. It was developed to meet the safety needs of consumers\u00a0and to simultaneously address\u00a0five key gaps which most air purifiers are unable to effectively fulfil.\nHealthier families and workplaces with Trident\nTo create healthier homes and safer workplaces, the Trident is equipped with unique capabilities and features, providing\u00a024/7\u00a0high disinfection rate and active sanitisation of all surfaces in the room. Besides eliminating viruses by up to 99.99% (including the family of coronaviruses), bacteria, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in a fast response time, the Trident also removes allergens, odour, and moulds.\n\uff06Safe Air Dome\u2019 technology \u2013 \u2018HUNT, CATCH, KILL\u2019\nTrident\u2019s proprietary triple killing action of cold plasma, advanced graphene electrostatic plate, and built-in UVC sanitises up to 99.99% of bacteria and viruses, preventing virus transmission within minutes of usage.\nBesides achieving higher disinfection rate, Trident also features high Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR) of 600 m3/h for MINI and 1010 m3/h for PLUS, resulting in fast air changes per hour (ACH). ACH measures the volume of air being filtered in a room in an hour. A minimum ACH of 5 is recommended by NEA for mitigating COVID-19 aerosol transmission risk (smoke CADR >=\u00a0room size (cubic meter) x 5)[2]. For a living room size of 34sqm in a typical 5-room HDB, Trident MINI achieves 7.67 ACH, while Trident PLUS achieves 6.47 ACH in a larger office space of 60sqm.\n24/7\u00a0surface sanitisation\nWhen kept operating, the Trident\u2019s cold plasma ions continuously sanitise all surfaces in the room and reduce the growth of bacteria and fungi on carpets and in humid areas, which is especially useful in Singapore\u2019s tropical climate.\nBuilt-in dual air quality sensors for automatic airflow adjustments\nWith built-in sensors for particulate matters and VOC, Trident monitors indoor air quality continuously and adjusts the airflow automatically according to air pollution levels, ensuring the constant delivery of clean and purified air.\nWashable electrostatic plates for cost saving\nUnlike conventional filters, Trident utilises washable electrostatic plates\u00a0to capture aerosols and particles from the air, eliminating the need to regularly replace filters. Trident has built in features to prompt users when to clean the washable electrostatic plates.\nIntuitive and user-friendly controls\nTrident comes with an intuitive design, large display, and easy-to-locate touch buttons, making it friendly for users of all ages to operate. The MINI is also incorporated with a convenient child-lock function, which makes it a good safeguard for families with young ones.
