        "raw_content": "CES 2024: All the Coolest (and Weirdest) Gaming Gear We Saw\nWhen you get into gaming, you likely won't just shop for the essential hardware, like graphics cards and mice with extra buttons. Before you know it, you'll be Googling gaming chairs and headsets and light-up keyboards. CES 2024 kicked things up a notch, debuting a wide variety of innovative gaming tech\u2014some of which is legitimately cool, and some of which is a little... quirky.\nCushions with haptic feedback for your gaming chair\nRazer's coolest CES product concept is a haptic feedback cushion for your gaming chair. Called Project Esther, this rumbly cushion for your rear end has 16 haptic sensors that line up nicely against your back, butt, and thighs. When you play games, you'll get vibrating feedback in different regions based on what's happening in-game. On the one hand, this makes sense: Haptic feedback via handheld controllers can add a lot to the experience of a game\u2014but having that feedback directed to your posterior is a bit of a strange twist.\nA handheld that runs your old Sega cartridges\nIf you're a collector with Sega Mega Drive and Genesis cartridges lying around, you could play those games on Hyperkin's new handheld, called the Mega 95. It has a 5-inch display that can easily toggle between 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios. There's no pricing or availability information at the moment.\nA Steam Deck rival from MSI\nThe release of the Steam Deck has set off a wave of handheld gaming consoles for PC gaming. We've already seen the Asus ROG Ally, and now there's the MSI Claw, which is the first gaming handheld to ship with the Intel Core Ultra chip. Like the ROG Ally, the MSI Claw also runs Windows 11. The Claw has a couple of macro keys, which will allow you to run a few pre-programmed actions at the press of a button. The console is priced between $699 and $799, and it'll ship in the first half of 2024, according to MSI.\nA powerful gaming PC with a tiny footprint\nWhen you think gaming PCs, you're probably visualizing a towering hulk of a cabinet with a transparent glass panel and enough RGB lighting to light up a room. ASUS wants you to revisit that vision with the ROG NUC, which is teeny-tiny. The machine weighs just 1.76lbs (800g) and when propped up vertically, it's just 1.6 inches wide and 5.6 inches tall.\nIt doesn't sacrifice on power either, as you get to choose between Intel Core Ultra 7 or Core Ultra 9 processors, up to Nvidia's RTX 4070 GPUs, and 64GB of RAM. The machine has four slots for PCIe SSD storage, too. There's no pricing or availability information at the moment, but it'll be interesting to see what the final build of this machine ships with. NUCs are famous for not shipping with storage, and airflow is also a concern for tiny cases, but they mostly do the job. I've used a NUC exclusively to play Age of Empires 2: Definitive Edition and it hasn't disappointed so far.\nA funky keyboard with RGB lighting\nHyte Keeb TKL is a keyboard with RGB lighting and dedicated media keys. It looks cool and has gasket-mounted keys, which should feel nicer to press than your average clackety keyboard. It has a couple of interesting magnetic rollers above the media keys, which you can program and use while gaming\u2014to switch out inventory items, cycle through weapons, etc. The Keeb TKL is priced at $179.99 and ships starting Feb. 15, 2024.\nA return to old-school Xbox controllers\nThe Xbox's original \"Duke\" controller has become the stuff of legend. It was massive and unergonomic, but it still has its fan following. Eventually, the Duke was replaced by the Xbox Controller S, and Hyperkin has now recreated that controller for your modern gaming devices. This new controller is called the Hyperkin DuchesS. This product is in development right now, so the final version could change significantly, but we do know that it'll work with Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Windows 10 or 11 gaming PCs.\nA Rubik's Cube lookalike for gaming\nThe WowCube looks and functions like a Rubik's Cube, but it has four screens on each side. You can twist these screens, tilt the device, and tap the screens to play games. With access to an app store to download games and on-screen widgets, it has the potential to be a fun little gadget. In practice, though, it's not for everyone. Lifehacker's Senior Technology Editor Jake Peterson tried out the WowCube at CES and he wasn't impressed. The device is priced at $699 and ships in Q1 2024.\nPranay Parab is an independent tech journalist based in Mumbai, India.

It\u2019s equipped with a five-inch display that has a toggle to switch between 4:3 and 16:9 modes, and a battery that Hyperkin says should last 10 hours per charge.\u00a0Think of it like a modern take on the Genesis Nomad with roughly three times the battery life and other modern conveniences.\nThe handheld looks to be a portable version of Hyperkin\u2019s MegaRetroN HD Gaming Console, the existing Genesis-compatible retro console released in 2018 and which now sells for $59.99. Hyperkin\u2019s press release doesn\u2019t go into detail about how the Mega 95 runs its classic Genesis titles, but the MegaRetroN HD reportedly uses a hardware emulation approach with quality that sits somewhere between a software emulator and the premium FPGA-based system used in Analogue\u2019s Mega Sg home console.\nAlthough the Mega 95 is designed primarily as a handheld system, there\u2019s also a USB-C dock available that\u2019ll let you plug it into a TV and which features ports to plug in additional controllers.\u00a0Each Mega 95 comes with a dock.\nPricing or a release date for the Mega 95 is yet to be announced, but for reference Hyperkin\u2019s handheld Super NES emulation machine currently sells for $119.99. With any luck, that could mean the Mega 95 ends up being more affordable and more readily available than the Analogue Pocket.\nUpdate January 9th, 8:18AM ET:\u00a0Added mention of the original Genesis Nomad, insultingly omitted from the original write-up.\nNetflix is turning into cable TV\nNetflix is going to take away its cheapest ad-free plan\nFord\u2019s new 48-inch digital dashboard is a lot of Android for one car\niOS 17.3 is out, adding Stolen Device Protection for your iPhone\nOnePlus 12 review: refreshingly basic\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nMore from this stream CES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nAll the CES highlights so far.\nMovano\u2019s smart ring is the rare CES health gadget that will actually ship\nI watched the Matic robo vac suck up a glass of milk.\nAlexa can now talk like a personal trainer or Socrates.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

The device is similar to Hyperkin's previous handhelds in the SupaBoy series, a line of devices that played SNES and Super Famicom cartridges on the go.\nYet the biggest selling point for the Mega 95 compared to the SupaBoy handhelds is that Hyperkin includes a docking station with the Mega 95's packaging. The docking station allows you to play games at 720p resolution on a TV and has two controller outputs, as shown in the image below.\nHyperkin previously made a retro device that plays Sega Genesis and Mega Drive cartridges in the past, most notably the MegaRetroN HD. Yet this is the first time Hyperkin has made a portable solution for someone to dust off their Sonic 3 cartridge and play it on the go instead of emulating the game on a handheld PC like Steam Deck. Of course, this is a great alternative for those with these cartridges who want to play on the go but do not own or want to buy a Nintendo Switch plus a copy of Sonic Origins.\nHyperkin has not announced a release date or price for the Mega 95, but the Hyperkin SupaBoy is retailing for $119.99, so Hyperkin may keep the Mega 95 around the same price point.\nTaylor is a Reporter at IGN.

        "raw_content": "Hyperkin\u2019s new Switch-style SEGA handheld console plays Genesis and Mega Drive games anywhere\nNote: The images on display here appear to be prototypes and do not officially represent the final product.\nAlongside all of this week\u2019s CES 2024 product announcements, Hyperkin is now ready to debut its new SEGA handheld console. Pulling inspiration from the classic Genesis Nomad of yesteryear, the new Hyperkin Mega 95\u00a0combines some of the design sensibilities of the Nintendo Switch to provide an all-in-one SEGA gaming system that works both at home on the big screen and in portable mode. Hit the jump for a closer look and more details.\nHyperkin\u2019s new SEGA handheld console \u2013 the Mega 95\nThe new SEGA handheld console wraps traditional controls around the center-mounted 5-inch display, similar to a Nintendo Switch in some ways but without the removable controllers, alongside the ability to pop original SEGA Genesis and Mega Drive cartridges right into the top of the unit.\nIt can function as a portable handheld machine with up to 10 hours of battery life per charge, but you also leverage the included USB-C dock so run the system at home on the big screen. It too can support external controllers when in docked mode.\nThere\u2019s doesn\u2019t appear to be any direct details on how the new SEGA handheld actually runs the original carts on the system. But it might very well leverage the same sort of hardware emulation the brand uses on its more affordable MegaRetroN SEGA home console. The Mega 95 display allows gamers to flip back and forth between a 4:3 and 16:9 aspect ratios and likely delivers emulation quality akin to your average software setup without getting quite up into the hardcore FPGA systems.\nAs of right now, Hyperkin is yet to divulge any specifics in terms of pricing or a launch window. But judging by some of its previous releases, some are suggesting it could land somewhere in the $120 range when it finally does go up for sale.\nAdd 9to5Toys to your Google News feed.\nGoogle News\nFTC: 9to5Toys is reader supported, we may earn income on affiliate links\nSubscribe to the 9to5Toys YouTube Channel for all of the latest videos, reviews, and more!\nGuides\nApps Games\nNews\nAbout the Author\nJustin Kahn\nJustin Kahn's favorite gear\nPXN MFi game controller\nAkai MPK USB MIDI Keyboard\nPopular in the Community"

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!

        "raw_content": "The Best Stuff from CES\u00a02024\nAs always, a new year kicks off with the technology industry descending on Las Vegas to showcase what's new for 2024. Here's some of the best stuff that was at the show.\nAnother CES is drawing to a close - and mercifully, it hasn\u2019t been all about awful and short-sighted implementations of AI that make you want to blow your brains out. Okay, most of it has been about that - but there\u2019s still been some fascinating new technology, both inside and outside the gaming space.\nAfter spending far too much time obsessing over all of the announcements and showcases out of CES, I\u2019ve come away with a few products that I really think stand out. For good or for ill. Naturally, the stuff featured here (generally) has a video gaming slant\u2026 but not entirely. Here\u2019s my picks of CES 2024:\nThe GPU wars continue with curious new launches from Nvidia and AMD\nPC graphics have been in a strange spot for a couple of years now, the market still reeling from the impact of all that blockchain nonsense. For those of us who want to use our GPUs for gaming, as god intended, it\u2019s frustrating - but it does feel like the market is slowly winding back to a sense of normality.\nAfter a fairly greedily-priced introduction to its RTX 40 series of GPUs, Nvidia looks to be re-tuning things with its mid-generation \u2018SUPER\u2019 refresh. They\u2019ve discontinued some cards, replaced with similarly-priced replacements that are significantly more powerful. A few other card brackets have received very welcome price drops. All in all, Nvidia will launch three new RTX 40 GPUs over the next month.\nAMD, meanwhile, is opening 2024 with the RX 7600 XT - an entry-level card that at $330 aims to undercut Nvidia\u2019s efforts in similar price brackets. That price puts it in between Nvidia\u2019s 4060 and its 4060 Ti, making for an interesting battle in that price bracket.\nAs always with GPUs, nothing really matters until the rubber meets the road and we can test and see real-life hardware performance numbers. We\u2019ll be back with those at some point in the future - but for now, it\u2019s already an interesting start to the year.\nThe MSI Claw is the latest challenger in the handheld gaming PC race\nHandheld gaming PCs have of course been around forever, but the true starting pistol on this form factor as a true \u2018category\u2019 of viable mainstream hardware was fired by Valve with the Steam Deck. Now, other PC hardware companies are catching up.\nAsus of course entered the market quite quickly with the ROG Ally, but this year\u2019s CES saw MSI enter the fray with the MSI Claw - a new device in a familiar form factor that has the words \u2018TRUE GAMING\u2019 etched into the upper portion of its frame, just in case anyone is left wondering what the device is for.\nThe Claw will come in three different models ranging from $700 to $800, and is powered by Intel\u2019s new generation of \u2018Meteor Lake\u2019 mobile processors. It\u2019s got a seven-inch 120Hz IPS display that outputs at 1080p, 16GB of RAM, and most of the features you\u2019d hope for like a 3.5mm headphone port and a MicroSD slot, plus some you might not be all that fussed about such as a power button with an integrated fingerprint scanner. That MicroSD port might be more useful to some models over others, as storage on the Claw starts at 512GB, but goes up to 1TB on the top end.\nIn terms of form factor, it\u2019s pretty similar to the Steam Deck, though it\u2019s heavier. It justifies that by having what MSI says is the largest battery of any device of this kind. The machine is powered by Windows 11. It\u2019ll be interesting to see how this holds up in testing, and how it overall compares to the Steam Deck OLED - but regardless, it\u2019s good to see this exciting segment of the market continuing to expand.\nRetro handheld saddos ride again with Hyperkin\u2019s Mega 95\nIf spending hundreds of dollars on a gaming PC in your pocket isn\u2019t your cup of tea, how about carrying around a little slice of the nineties? Plus some original carts.\nThe Mega 95 is basically a gaming handheld that takes the form of a six-button Sega Mega Drive/Genesis controller with a screen whacked in the middle. As a bonus, it takes original carts. In practice, it most closely resembles the Sega Nomad, a handheld Mega Drive that Sega itself put out in the nineties, back when it was releasing about eighteen different bits of confusing hardware every year.\nThe Mega 95\u2019s extra party trick is that you can also pick up a dock that allows it to be plugged into your TV. The dock contains two ports which can be used to plug in original controllers or modern reproductions. That\u2019s nice, though there are a number of existing modern Mega Drive alternatives, including one from Hyperkin.\nThe handheld element\u2019s point sort of eludes me, to be honest. It\u2019s a cool-looking device, and referencing the Nomad is a great nineties deep cut\u2026 but in 2024, are you really going to take this on holiday and lug a bunch of carts with you? For some reason, the screen on the device is 16:9, and has a switch to let you play games in either 4:3 or a stretched 16:9\u2026 despite the fact that the Mega Drive has no 16:9 games.\nHyperkin wasn\u2019t revealing any more about this product at CES beyond its existence - no word on how it runs the games, a price, or even a release window. But based on Hyperkin\u2019s other products, you can expect hardware emulation that\u2019ll probably be decent, but not as 1:1 accurate to real machines as on a higher-end, higher-priced product like those from Analogue. It\u2019ll also undoubtedly be more premium and pricey than the cheap and cheerful Super Pocket, mind.\nAs for the price, Hyperkin already has a portable SNES very similar to this, and it runs for around $120 - though Hyperkin will announce more on this specific handheld in due course.\nLG\u2019s transparent OLED TV feels like it\u2019s from the future\nHonestly, this one absolutely has to be seen to be believed - thus the video embed from the guys at CNET. It\u2019s wild. In this, LG delivers a television that looks pretty normal in its basic mode - but with a press of a button it transforms, taking away the backdrop so that you can quite literally see through the TV to the wall or whatever else is behind.\nThis technology has shown up in mega-bucks concepts before, but LG\u2019s roll-out here is the first time this sort of technology has been in a consumer-facing product for a (still eye-wateringly expensive) consumer-facing price.\nIt has hologram vibes. It feels a bit like AR. Instantly, I imagine a phone with this technology and it gives me palpitations (though that is obviously presently impossible). It reminds me a lot of stuff like Minority Report or Total Recall. But it\u2019s real, it works, and I honestly think it looks rather stunning - though it might not be what you\u2019d want for gaming. But as a piece of technology - wow, it\u2019s cool.\nThe best game streaming service is getting a little bit better\nMake no mistake, GeForce Now is hands-down the best product out there if you want to stream your games over the internet from afar without having to run them locally on high-end hardware. The machines it runs on are great, you get generally great versions of games, and it\u2019s even directly compatible with other store fronts and services, so if you own something on Steam or have a PC Game Pass subscription, you can play those titles through GeForce Now, so long as they\u2019re compatible.\nAt CES, GeForce Now got a customary update that promised more game compatibility, including some Activision Blizzard titles that\u2019ll surely eventually be hitting Game Pass. But the real news came in the form of the reveal of \u2018Day Pass\u2019 subscriptions - an offering that lets you use GeForce Now streaming for a single day in exchange for a flat fee.\nAs it currently stands, due to high demand the only way you can subscribe to GFN is to stump up for a 6-month subscription - so this is good for those who don\u2019t want to do that. But also, these new day passes are a great way to try out the service, or for those of us who have powerful PCs in our homes to use the service when we\u2019re away from home without paying as if we\u2019re using it daily. It\u2019s a smart play, and GFN remains the best option in this particular market.\nAlienware\u2019s newest OLED PC Gaming Monitors are ridiculously desirable\nAlienware was the first company out of the gate with a truly good OLED gaming monitor for PCs with its first generation of the QD-OLED range. At CES 2024, the company revealed that it\u2019s following that up with two new models - and both look excellent.\nWith the likes of Asus nipping at their heels in the PC OLED space, Alienware is firing back with a 32-inch and 27-inch model, both using stunning Samsung panels.\nThe 32-inch monitor has Nvidia Gsync technology, up to 4K resolution, a 240Hz refresh rate, Dolby Vision HDR, and\na sweet curve. It\u2019s an eye-watering $1200, but that actually isn\u2019t so bad for this class of monitor.\nThe 27-inch monitor tops out at 1440p, and is flat - but it can go to 360Hz. It swaps out GSync for the cheaper-to-license AMD Freesync; the monitor is $900.\nHonda\u2019s newest car can be driven with a PS5 controller, for some reason\nDumb gimmicks are a tentpole feature of CES, and one of the best this year happened when Sony drove a car on stage at its yearly press conference\u2026 driven by an exec holding a PlayStation 5 DualSense controller.\nThe car in question is a new corporate tie-up between Sony and Honda, the new Afeela EV that aims to combine Honda\u2019s automotive chops with Sony\u2019s skill with cutting-edge technology. The car uses Unreal Engine for its in-car graphics (no, really). There was also a hint that the team behind the Afeela has been working with Gran Turismo developer Polyphony Digital, so presumably you\u2019ll be able to drive the car in-game in short order.\nYou\u2019ll likely never be able to drive a car from outside it with a game controller, at least not in any country with remotely sensible road traffic laws. But on a serious note, game controller compatibility is rather useful in cars, especially in EVs. The ability to sync an Xbox controller to a Tesla and play Vampire Survivors while parked can seriously take the tedious edge off charging or waiting around - so to see that being embraced more and more is a good thing.\nG-Sync Pulsar could be a game changer\nGraphics powerhouse Nvidia had a lot to talk about at CES, including continuing forays into the world of AI, and so it didn\u2019t place too much of an emphasis on G-Sync Pulsar, a new technology it\u2019s gearing up to debut. But I think it could low-key be one of their most important announcements of the show.\nPulsar basically aims to nip motion blur in the bud - something that\u2019s been a problem, especially on certain types of display, forever. An off-screen photo from Nvidia aimed to showcase what a difference this might make - but also, it\u2019s difficult to really understand technology like this until you see and use it yourself - something I personally experienced with Nvidia Reflex.\nBut what might the actual difference-maker be? Well, I hand off to John Linneman from our friends over at DigitalFoundry, who can explain it far more succinctly than I. John says:\n\u201cPulsar basically seeks to eliminate persistence motion blur that has continued to plague flat panel displays since the beginning while allowing VRR - a display technology that allows dynamic refresh rate adjustment to eliminate judder. Previously, these were incompatible but pulsar seeks to combine them allowing super crisp motion with variable frame-rates. If this takes off, flat panels could finally offer something that even CRTs couldn't match - variable refresh rates with perfect motion clarity. I can't wait to see it in action.\u201d\nAsus launches its first ROG-branded NUC mini-PC\n\u2018Republic of Gamers\u2019 is a bloody silly name for a brand, but Asus\u2019 hardcore gamer imprint has nevertheless become something of a hallmark of quality. I type this staring at a ROG-branded monitor, in fact. And now, ROG is branching into a new market.\nLast year, Intel discontinued its NUC (aka \u2018Next Unit of Compute\u2019) mini PCs - but Asus pretty quickly stepped up and announced that it\u2019d continue the NUC footprint under license with Intel. NUCs are compact and powerful, but they aren\u2019t always designed for gaming - but now the imprint is under Asus, it\u2019s perhaps not a surprise to see the company debut a gaming-focused variant under the ROG banner.\nThat product is the Asus ROG NUC 14, and it\u2019s dinky - just 270x180x50mm. This form factor is a little console-like in that it can be laid flat or placed in an upright position with a stand.\nIn spec terms, the ROG NUC 14 supports a small range of Intel processors, up to 32GB of RAM, four M.2 SSD storage slots, and for graphics you\u2019ll have the choice between an Nvidia GeForce 4060 or 4070, in the version that usually ships in laptops. It\u2019s got six USB ports, a Thunderbolt port, HDMI and DisplayPort outputs, audio jacks, and an Ethernet Port.\nThe key information about the machine - such as the price, release date, and information on how hot it\u2019ll run when pushing games, remains unknown. But it\u2019s an exciting initial announcement, for sure.\nSmart Grills sound silly, and they are, but I still want one\nI know this is a gaming website, but let me digress with a small detour: I love smoking meats. Maybe this is part of my \u2018dad era\u2019, or whatever, or just a horrible consequence of crossing into my mid-thirties. But I love nothing more now than lavishing attention on a slow-cooked meat, indirectly smoked on a barbeque with a silly price.\nBecause I\u2019m also a gadget nerd, however, I like to let my interest in tech and BBQ meet - and I already have a couple of silly gadgets so I can do things like get a ping on my phone if the heat is too much or whatever else.\nOn one hand, this stuff is tremendously silly. Man has been cooking over fire forever, and we can do it just fine without a load of gadgets. And yet\u2026 It's convenient. And cool. So, y\u2019know, I\u2019m still into it.\nThe BBQ kings at Weber have made a few of those products, and have been in the smart game for a while. But at CES, they were showing off the Weber Summit FS38X, their latest outdoor smart grill. This thing has it all. It is the pimp-my-ride of barbeques. There\u2019s a touchscreen, a sensor array to ensure the correct temperature and an even cook inside, and even an infrared broiler you can raise or lower to get the exact finish you want. It can even be transformed into a rotisserie. It\u2019s bonkers.\nJust typing about it has me salivating (or maybe that\u2019s just the fact I\u2019ve not eaten dinner). The only catch? Well - for a start, it\u2019ll run you five grand. Maybe I\u2019ll stick to my regular old Weber for now after all\u2026\nThese mysterious \u2018Handy\u2019 VR add-ons\nFound the best booth at CES \ud83e\udee1 #vr #ces2024 pic.twitter.com/2ESMtYbx5n\nHonestly, lads. Just stop it. Get some help.\nThere\u2019s now a Razer Gamer RGB car\nThis one probably has the same target audience as the Handy VR gadget listed above, to be honest. This wasn\u2019t technically a CES announcement, but it did make a first appearance on the show floor after being revealed in a YouTube video about a month ago.\nBasically, Razer and Lexus partnered on a new vehicle - a gamer-focused version of the Lexus TX concept car. The car has lovely, garish RGB lights everywhere, including the underlights that in the UK in the mid-noughties I distinctly remember being christened \u2018wanker lights\u2019.\nTo be fair to the car, it\u2019d be pretty good for a gamer road trip. It\u2019s got monitors, can accommodate four gaming laptops, and has its own Xbox. Sadly, it isn\u2019t road legal - which is probably for the best.\nSign in and unlock a world of features\nGet access to commenting, homepage personalisation, newsletters, and more!\nAlex Donaldson\nAssistant Editor\nAlex has been writing about video games for decades, but first got serious in 2006 when he founded genre-specific website RPG Site.

        "raw_content": "Best of CES 2024: From 4K Projectors to Neural Headphones, Here Is the Best Tech to Look Forward to This Year\nThe Consumer Electronics Show features thousands upon thousands of tech products and we narrowed it down to the best.\nBy\nRudie Obias\nRudie Obias\neditor\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, Variety may receive an affiliate commission.\nEvery year, the best and brightest companies in tech come to Las Vegas for the Consumer Electronics Show \u2014\u00a0otherwise known as CES \u2014\u00a0to announce and showcase new entertainment, audio & video, wellness, household and transportation products for the year ahead.\nOver five days at the Las Vegas Convention Center and surrounding hotels and casinos, we visited booths, press conferences, presentations and participated in countless tech demos to find the best of the best of CES. These brands and products were chosen based on usefulness, function, innovation and overall cool factor.\nWe narrowed down the winners in a number of categories from laptops to robot vacuums and smart home devices to 4K TVs. We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar. The LG Soundbar S95TR is a 9.1.5-channel sound system that comes with 65-inch soundbar with three up-firing speakers, rear speakers and a subwoofer for your TV, while the system is Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and DTS:X compatible for immersive and detailed audio. It also connects wirelessly to just about any LG 4K TVs via WOWcast.\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nIf you\u2019re alone, but needed a portable solution to dynamic Zoom video calls or just making a TikTok video, the Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit is a very cool and useful way to make self-tracking videos with your Apple iPhone.It\u2019s MagSafe and NFC (Near Field Communication), so all you have to do is attach your iPhone and Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro will track and follow your body and face. During our time with the product, it appeared to move smoothly and effortlessly with 360-degree rotation and 90-degree tilt. wMeanwhile, it has up to five hours of use per charge and works in-app with TikTok, Zoom, Instagram and more.Belkin has it priced at $179.99, while the tech company has yet to announce availability.\nMaster & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic partnered with a neuroscience company called Neurable to deliver a pair of wireless headphones that can your track work sessions and measure your stress levels through your brain waves through a mobile app. They can even recommend when you should take a break when you\u2019re deep into your work.Aside from their focus capabilities, Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones offer premium audio quality with active noise cancellation and up to 32 hours of battery life per charge. The headphones are available for pre-order for $649 with delivery in early 2024.\nJBL Live 3 Earbuds\nNot only do the JBL Live 3 Earbuds feature world-class audio that crisp, clear and rich with active noise-cancellation, they offer something that most premium wireless earbuds do not \u2014\u00a0a charging case with a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen display. Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line. It has an AMOLED touchscreen display that comes in three case sizes (42mm, 47mm and 51mm), while the watch comes with an LED flashlight, a heart rate monitor, blood oxygen monitor, step and calorie counter and a built-in GPS with up to a whopping 16 days of battery life per charge.In our brief testing period, the Garmin Epix Pro appeared to be durable and solid since it\u2019s made with premium materials, such as stainless steel, a fiber-reinforced polymer, a steel rear cover and Corning Gorilla Glass. It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels. It has a 1000R curvature, 7680 x 2160 4K resolution with up to 120Hz for smooth motion and action when gaming, while it has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits. The monitor has dual 10-watt speakers for audio, as well as AMD\u2019s FreeSync Premium to reduce screen tearing or distortion. It\u2019s ideal for PC consoles, Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5.Acer will have it ready for retail sometime during the first half of 2024 with pricing starting at $2,499.99.\nRoboRock S8 MaxV Ultra\nThe new Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is a hybrid cleaner that vacuums up dirt, dust and grime from carpets, rugs, and hardwood floors with powerful 10,000Pa of suction pressure, while it also mops tiles in kitchens and bathrooms with dual sonic vibration scrubbers.The smart home robovac has a versatile charging dock that\u2019s self-emptying with up to a seven-week capacity of debris storage, self-filling water tank for mopping, and self-cleaning reservoir for maintenance on itself.

The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"
