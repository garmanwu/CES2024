(\"Owlet\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:OWLT), the pioneer of smart infant monitoring, today announces the launch and availability of Dream Sock\u00ae and BabySat\u2122, two medical devices with recent clearances from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). Both innovations deliver real-time health insights with medical-grade accuracy and unprecedented advancements for at-home infant care.\n\"We are on a mission to help parents monitor what matters most and are proud to now offer two FDA-cleared, at-home infant monitors to countless parents who want and need more information on their baby\u2019s well-being,\" said Kurt Workman, Owlet Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder. \"Both the FDA-cleared Dream Sock and BabySat devices are a representation of our endless commitment to providing clarity and peace of mind for parents, while also setting new standards in the industry of infant care.\"\nAccording to a survey, parents lose a staggering 133 nights of sleep during the first year of their newborn\u2019s life1. Additionally, parents will experience more than three million emergency care visits for their infants each year2, and, annually, more than two million children under the age of five have outpatient visits for respiratory syncytial virus (\"RSV\")3. Dream Sock and BabySat are designed to arm caregivers with the tools to combat these common stressors \u2013 being clinically proven to accurately track and display an infant\u2019s vital signs and notify parents in real-time so they can take action if required.\nFDA-Cleared Dream Sock\nSince achieving its De Novo clearance from the FDA in November 2023, Dream Sock continues to be the first-of-its-kind medical pulse oximetry solution for infants without the need for a prescription. Rigorously tested in both hospital and at-home environments and found to be compliant with all relevant performance and safety standards, the Dream Sock device provides accurate and actionable data to parents.\n\"Dream Sock is a breakthrough product for the industry and expands our medical-grade monitoring technology to all consumers,\" said Dr. Alisa Niksch, Pediatric Cardiologist and Senior Director of Medical Affairs at Owlet. \"This device will equip parents of otherwise healthy babies with the real-time data they need to make informed care decisions for their infants. Owlet is dedicated to advancing the capabilities of Dream Sock to enhance care for infants in the home.\"\nCaregivers of healthy babies between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs can now track their infant\u2019s Live Health Readings, including pulse rate and oxygen saturation level, in the Owlet Dream App (iOS & Android), as well as receive real-time Health Notifications for low pulse rate, high pulse rate, and low oxygen. These features are available to both existing and new Dream Sock users who opt to enable these features in the Dream App.\nFDA-Cleared BabySat\nThe BabySat pulse oximetry monitoring system combines hospital-grade accuracy with Owlet\u2019s modern and wire-free sock design, and is intended for infants between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs with acute or chronic medical conditions. BabySat also provides the ability to track live vital signs, but is distinct from Owlet\u2019s Dream Sock in that it is available through prescription only, and allows a healthcare provider to set and adjust customizable alarms for oxygen saturation and pulse rate that are tailored to an infant\u2019s individual needs.\nResearch shows there is a 40% decrease in mortality rates with the use of in-home pulse oximetry monitoring to track oxygen saturation levels for complex congenital heart disease in infants4. The availability of the BabySat pulse oximeter for more vulnerable infant populations better connects healthcare providers and caregivers, and ultimately allows caregivers to more confidently care for their little ones at home. BabySat will also be eligible for insurance reimbursement, increasing affordability and further democratizing access to these advanced monitoring tools. Additional details on BabySat prescription, fulfillment, and insurance reimbursement will be announced soon.\n\"The launch of BabySat is a huge accomplishment for both parents and providers to enhance care coordination outside of the hospital,\" said Jim Fidacaro, Owlet Senior Vice President and General Manager of Healthcare. \"It extends medical-grade, personalized infant care to the home environment, and with oversight from a physician, parents of babies with health conditions can feel more in control of their little one\u2019s well-being.\"\nOwlet is committed to offering products that set a new standard in infant care, combining advanced technology with ease of use to help caregivers have increased peace of mind while monitoring what matters most.

Owlet is dedicated to advancing the capabilities of Dream Sock to enhance care for infants in the home.\u201d\nCaregivers of healthy babies between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs can now track their infant\u2019s Live Health Readings, including pulse rate and oxygen saturation level, in the Owlet Dream App (iOS & Android), as well as receive real-time Health Notifications for low pulse rate, high pulse rate, and low oxygen. These features are available to both existing and new Dream Sock users who opt to enable these features in the Dream App.\nFDA-Cleared BabySat\nThe BabySat pulse oximetry monitoring system combines hospital-grade accuracy with Owlet\u2019s modern and wire-free sock design, and is intended for infants between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs with acute or chronic medical conditions. BabySat also provides the ability to track live vital signs, but is distinct from Owlet\u2019s Dream Sock in that it is available through prescription only, and allows a healthcare provider to set and adjust customizable alarms for oxygen saturation and pulse rate that are tailored to an infant\u2019s individual needs.\nResearch shows there is a 40% decrease in mortality rates with the use of in-home pulse oximetry monitoring to track oxygen saturation levels for complex congenital heart disease in infants4. The availability of the BabySat pulse oximeter for more vulnerable infant populations better connects healthcare providers and caregivers, and ultimately allows caregivers to more confidently care for their little ones at home. BabySat will also be eligible for insurance reimbursement, increasing affordability and further democratizing access to these advanced monitoring tools. Additional details on BabySat prescription, fulfillment, and insurance reimbursement will be announced soon.\n\u201cThe launch of BabySat is a huge accomplishment for both parents and providers to enhance care coordination outside of the hospital,\u201d said Jim Fidacaro, Owlet Senior Vice President and General Manager of Healthcare. \u201cIt extends medical-grade, personalized infant care to the home environment, and with oversight from a physician, parents of babies with health conditions can feel more in control of their little one\u2019s well-being.\u201d\nOwlet is committed to offering products that set a new standard in infant care, combining advanced technology with ease of use to help caregivers have increased peace of mind while monitoring what matters most.

        "raw_content": "Gadgets handpicked by our editors\nThe Best of CES 2024\nThe Best of CES 2024: 27 Pieces of Tech That Could Actually Be Useful to You This Year\nIn a trade show so often rife with pie-in-the-sky concepts, these products stood out.\nIf you buy something from the links on this page, we may earn a commission. Why Trust Us?\nThe 2024 edition of the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) \u2014 one of the biggest annual consumer tech industry events \u2014 wraps today. Virtually countless new products debuted at the show over the past four days, and they ranged from computers and TVs to various home appliances and small gadget accessories. CES has always been a venue for brands to display concepts and ultra-premium offerings. (Take, this year, the stunning and transparent LG Signature OLED T TV.) But among the outstanding design and engineering, the most noteworthy trend this year was AI making its way into more and more of our tech.\nThe products at this year\u2019s trade show proved that in the years ahead, artificial intelligence will do a lot more than just help with productivity. AI will also enable a TV to deliver pristine picture quality, tune a speaker for optimal sound, and even make sure a meal is perfectly cooked, to name just a few tasks. AI-powered tech in everyday appliances looks bound to become a norm in the years ahead as well, if you\u2019re looking to give someone or yourself the gift of an extra pair of (virtual) hands around the house.\nAs we do every year, we spent days tuning in to product briefings and combing through press releases and spec sheets to handpick the best new gadgets that debuted at CES 2024. We focused on products that will actually go on sale and have the potential to make their way into consumers\u2019 daily routines in the weeks and months ahead. (There can be a lot of vaporware at the show, after all.)\nWe broke down the most exciting products that captured our attention into the following major categories: Entertainment & Audio, Computers & Accessories, Mobile Gadgets, Home & Appliances, and Family. Since most of these products are not available for purchase just yet, be sure to come back in the months ahead to learn more about these gadgets once we\u2019ve had hands-on experience with them.\nEntertainment & Audio\nThe TCL QM8 was our favorite TV of 2023, and its 2024 sequel is even more exciting. The latest iteration of the 4K TV brings a quantum dot mini LED panel with more local dimming zones for superior contrast and a peak brightness of a whopping 5,000 nits. That translates to double the brightness of the 2023 model, ensuring the 2024 TCL QM8 will deliver striking visuals even in brightly lit spaces.\nThe 4K TV will become available to order in the months ahead. We don\u2019t know the pricing details yet, but given TCL\u2019s track record, we expect it will be super reasonable. The tech giant also unveiled a TV with a stunning 115-inch mini LED screen \u2014 the largest of its kind.\n\u2014 Stefan Vazharov, Senior Technology Editor, Reviews\nIn addition to delivering a sleek design, comfy fit, and the iconic brand's signature sound and top-tier noise cancellation, the Momentum Sport true wireless earbuds by Sennheiser pack heart rate and temperature sensors for next-level activity and wellness tracking. The sensors' readings can integrate with the user's preferred health- and fitness-tracking platforms like Apple Health, Garmin Connect, Strava, and Peloton, to name a few.\nThe sweat- and water-resistant earbuds will become available to order in April for $329.99. There will be three colors to choose from: burned olive, polar black, and metallic graphite.\n\u2014 SV\nJBL\u2019s Live 670NC and Live 770NC wireless headphones are our favorite to arrive at CES 2024. Like their excellent predecessors, the newcomers deliver a mixture of elegant design, high-quality sound with spatial audio capabilities, reliable noise cancellation, and superb battery life, all at an agreeable price. The Live 670NC cans have an on-ear fit, while the 770NC has a traditional over-ear layout.\nThe latest JBL headphones will hit the shelves in March. The Live 770NC and Live 670NC will cost $199.95 and $129.95, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Samsung Music Frame, like the legendary TV with the same, is a tech product that can effortlessly blend into any home decor via customizable covers. Equipped with Samsung Q-Symphony tech, the speaker will sync perfectly with its maker\u2019s TVs and soundbars for an immersive surround sound experience.\nDetails about the pricing and retail availability of the Samsung Music Frame have yet to be made available, but we don't expect the wait to be too long.\n\u2014 SV\nThe JBL Xtreme 4 is a sequel to one of our favorite waterproof Bluetooth speakers and an instant best-in-class contender. The gadget is capable of blasting AI-enhanced sound that\u2019s customizable via an app and up to 30 hours of audio playback between power-ups. Its replaceable battery pack sets it apart from all rivals.\nWe like that JBL manufactured the speaker using 70% recycled plastic and 100% reclaimed fabric. The Xtreme 4 will hit the shelves this June in several colors with a $379.95 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nThe EarFun Wave Pro wireless headphones are the audio maker's first and a rock-solid contender for the best budget set in the game. Like the brand's stellar wireless earbuds, the over-ear cans offer an appealing combination of sleek design, customizable sound with support for Hi-Res Audio, and strong noise cancellation. To top things off, the headphones can rather impressively deliver 80 hours of wireless playback between charges.\nSales of the EarFun Wave Pro headphones will begin this spring. The headphones will cost $79.99 \u2014 an incredible design given their design, specs, and onboard features.\n\u2014 SV\nComputers & Accessories\nThe ASUS ZenBook Duo is an exciting new addition to the PC laptop realm not only for its striking dual-screen design but also for its affordable price. The notebook will start below $1,500 when it becomes available to order this spring. Combined with its versatile design and high-end specs, the price makes a serious case for choosing the new ZenBook Duo over a premium touchscreen laptop with a conventional form factor.\nHardware-wise, the ZenBook Duo features a pair of high-resolution OLED touchscreens with a high refresh rate and a cutting-edge Intel Core chip with Arc graphics. Of course, the product will be bundled with a Bluetooth keyboard with an integrated trackpad.\n\u2014 SV\nHP\u2019s Omen Transcend 14 gaming laptop impressed us by delivering top-tier hardware specs \u2014 an Intel Core Ultra chip, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 Series graphics, a high-performance OLED display panel, and a rich set of connectivity features \u2014 in a compact and elegant package that weighs just a feather above 3.5 pounds. That\u2019s on par with the weight of a 14-inch MacBook Pro, making the Omen Transcend 14 incredibly lightweight and portable for a high-performance PC gaming rig.\nThe versatile Omen Transcend 14 is already available to pre-order from HP with a $1,500 starting price. That\u2019s quite a bargain, especially considering its striking design and futureproof specs.\n\u2014 SV\nThe detachable keyboard on Lenovo\u2019s ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid made it our favorite Android tablet of CES 2024. Because it features a full-blown PC with an Intel chip and Windows 11 on board, it gives you two devices (a laptop and a tablet) wrapped into one \u2014 not just a feature-rich tablet with a bundled keyboard.\nRemarkably, the two components can work together or separately, depending on your needs. The product will hit the shelves in the spring with a hefty $1,999 price tag.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Odyssey OLED G8 4K gaming monitor by Samsung deserves your attention for being great at, well, everything \u2014 from high-performance gameplay to delivering your favorite streaming content with incredible picture quality via the tech giant\u2019s smart platform. Combined with a minimalist design, the product\u2019s 32-inch display panel with millions of individually backlit pixels and antireflective finish makes it a great upgrade option for work and play.\nSamsung also equipped the monitor with a SmartThings Hub for controlling connected home gadgets. An ultra-wide Odyssey OLED G9 monitor with a curved 49-inch screen debuted as well for those who need to replace two screens.\n\u2014 SV\nNVIDIA launched the GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs during CES. The latest-generation graphics cards pack dedicated cores for AI processing, ensuring the cutting-edge tech will take the users\u2019 experience \u2014 from heavy workloads to in-game visuals \u2014 to a whole new level. The latest components deliver a significant performance bump over their top-shelf GeForce RTX 30 series predecessors.\nPricing of the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 40 SUPER Series GPUs will start at a reasonable $599 for an RTX 4070 Super version. The range-topping RTX 4080 SUPER, dubbed a \u201c4K monster\u201d by its maker, will cost $999.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Razer Aetner monitor light bar is a handy desktop accessory that will give your work and gaming sessions a bright, colorful upgrade. The attachable dual light consists of an adjustable white strip and a back-facing row of color LEDs that are customizable via the excellent Razer Chroma RGB suite. The white light will illuminate your workspace, while the colorful backlight is a must for gaming.\nWe like that the Razer Aetner is compatible with the Matter smart home standard and that its LED lights have a lifetime of 25,000 hours.\n\u2014 SV\nThe Clutch Tanto Mini Xbox controller by HyperX \u2014 the maker of our favorite budget gamepad \u2014 stands out with an incredibly compact design. Its compact footprint is tailor-made for younger gamers. I tip my hat to HyperX for creating the product, as I still remember how unwieldy the three-button Sega Genesis controller was back in the early 1990s.\nThe tiny gamepad has a standard Xbox layout and a built-in audio jack. It will launch this spring with an attractive $39.99 sticker.\n\u2014 SV\nDo you have a teenage gamer that's very amenable to bribery? RCA\u2019s new gaming monitor might just do the trick to get them to agree to study. My son, the gamer of our house, watched the press release and was blown away by the \u201cdamn fast\u201d 240Hz refresh rate, the 2-millisecond input lag, 1 millisecond GtG response time, cool swiveling features, USB-C 90W charging and DisplayPort Alt-Mode, and \u201csick backlighting.\u201d\nThe whole thing is on a pivot stand and seamlessly switches between PS5, computer, Xbox, or any other platform you choose to use it for. Personally, I\u2019m hoping some English homework makes it on the monitor between bouts of GTA. RCA is new to gaming monitors, but being the grandad of the electronics industry gives them a great leg-up, and we\u2019re excited to see more innovations like this from the brand in the future.\n\u2014 Cat Bowen, Senior Editor, Reviews\nMobile Gadgets\nOtterBox launched a lineup of elegant and sustainable iPhone cases made from sustainable cactus-based leather. Dubbed Desserto, the leather-like material is stylish, great to interact with, and, crucially, eco-friendly. The accessory giant also unveiled a MagSafe wallet and an Apple Watch band from the same material.\nThe MagSafe-compatible case will become available in several colors this spring for the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Pro family. It will cost $59.99, while the MagSafe wallet and the Apple Watch band will go for $49.99 and $39.99, respectively.\n\u2014 SV\nZagg launched a version of the iconic mophie juice pack battery case for the latest iPhones during CES 2024. A synonym for iPhone backup power for well over a decade, the nifty gadget will significantly extend the charging independence of the Apple smartphone while keeping it pocket-friendly. It will be available for iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max.\nYou'll be able to pre-order the mophie juice pack in late February for $99.99, which will come with a robust two-year warranty.\n\u2014 SV\nBelkin's Stand Pro is not just yet another sleek MagSafe iPhone stand from the well-known accessory maker. Thanks to support for Apple's DockKit standard, the motorized accessory offers 360-degree movement tracking. This means that whether users are on a video call or capturing content for social media, they will always be perfectly framed.\nThe accessory has a button for enabling and disabling tracking. Of course, it also doubles as a fast MagSafe charger. You will be able to snag one in the months ahead for $179.99.\n\u2014 SV\nHome & Appliances\nThe Nanoleaf Skylight is a noteworthy, low-key addition to the maker\u2019s excellent lineup of lighting fixtures that were showcased at CES 2024. In a manner befitting its name, the smart home product consists of light panels that are flush-mountable on a ceiling. It\u2019s easily expandable and adaptable to any space and usage scenario.\nLike all Nanoleaf products, the Skylight can glow with millions of customizable colors and shades of white. It\u2019s controllable via an app or through voice commands from your preferred virtual assistant.\n\u2014 SV\nLG\u2019s latest Styler is a home appliance that will make the chore of storing and maintaining your favorite clothes in perfect condition a breeze. Thanks to a high-tech Moving Hanger system and an available Fine Dust cycle, the Styler will remove dust particles. What\u2019s more, the product\u2019s integrated high-pressure steamer can remove wrinkles and sanitize clothes.\nOther key Styler features include a room dehumidification functionality and a ventilation system. Pricing and availability details are yet to be revealed.\n\u2014 SV\nThe eufy X10 Pro Omni robot vacuum impressed us by offering a ton of desirable features at a price point that\u2019s well below $1,000. The versatile cleaning robot can vacuum and mop floors with the help of its sophisticated navigation setup feature. Better yet, it can empty its bin, refill its water container, and even clean and dry its mopping pads by docking into its Omni station.\nAnker will begin offering the eufy X10Pro Omni in February for $799.99. That\u2019s considerably less than big-name rivals with comparable features.\n\u2014 SV\nThis Wi-Fi-equipped smart deadbolt by Philips will replace your keys or smartphone with your palm. The convenient gadget has a sophisticated palm reader, which will unlock it by scanning your hand\u2019s vein patterns. The latter are unique for everyone, guaranteeing that only authorized users can unlock it.\nUnsurprisingly, the Philips deadbolt is also compatible with virtual assistant voice commands, allowing you to control it or keep tabs on its status. The product will be available to buy in the coming months for $359.99.\n\u2014 SV\nFamily\nWith the BeamO multiscope, Withings treated us to the best health and wellness gadget of CES 2024. The device sets a new standard for wellness monitoring by merging a contactless thermometer, a digital stethoscope, an ECG, and an oximeter in a sleek package that\u2019s easy to use at home or anywhere else.\nGetting the readings will take about a minute, and users will be able to share the results with their doctor via a sleek companion app. The BeamO will become available to order this summer for $249.95.\n\u2014 SV\nMasimo\u2019s monitoring technology is used in over 10 million babies annually in hosptials worldwide, and now they\u2019re bringing their powerful tech to parents with an FDA-approved-for-prescription wearable baby monitor. Utilizing a sock/boot style device, it monitors your baby\u2019s pulse, skin temperature if your baby has rolled over, alerting parents if anything is outside normal limits. It can be used when your baby is asleep and awake for continuous monitoring if your baby requires that.The Stork Baby Wearable Monitor can also share your baby\u2019s data with their health providers. For parents of medically fragile children, this little device could help bring a lot of peace, and because it\u2019s by-prescription, insurance may cover it, though insurance plans are not yet in place.\nThe non-prescription version is sold at major retailers, and it also includes a high-resolution video camera along with all of the monitoring available in the prescription monitor, without the immediate alerts.\u2014 CB\nMaxi Cosi is one of our favorite baby brands at Best Products. They\u2019re known for their high-quality, innovative, affordable baby products, and as of CES 2024, they've entered into the electronics space. With the See Pro 360\u00ba Baby Monitor, they\u2019re taking their affordable and innovative reputation and applying it to a very pricey realm.The See Pro 360\u00ba is a combination of a handheld monitor and camera and a smartphone monitor, giving parents choices of how to view their baby. Like last year\u2019s debut, the Q-Bear, this monitor uses CryAssist technology not only to detect when your baby\u2019s crying but also to translate the sounds to determine if your baby is sleepy, hungry, wet, or just plain cranky.\nIt has everything you\u2019d expect in a modern monitor: two-way talking, temperature and humidity sensors, a high-definition camera with clear color, night vision, and a long battery life on the monitor itself. It\u2019s doing this all for just $199.\u2014 CB\nThe Owlet is not new to the wearable baby monitor game, but they\u2019ve recently stepped up their game, and they\u2019re showing it off at CES. Like Masimo, they\u2019re offering an FDA-cleared-for-prescription wearable baby monitor for parents of babies with a need for clinical monitoring outside of the clinical setting. The Owlet offers something unique from Masimo in that your child\u2019s pediatrician can set the parameters for the alerts sent to them and the parents.\nThe BabySat measures oxygen levels, heart rate, and levels of motion. Stats are easily viewable through Owlet\u2019s straightforward app. Like their original sock, it\u2019s a wireless monitoring device designed to stay put on your baby\u2019s foot all night (and day) long.\u2014 CB\nTikiSmart just finished a wildly successful crowd-funding campaign, and now they\u2019re showcasing their kid-safety system at CES. TikiSmart is a first-of-its-kind whole-home child monitoring device. It\u2019s a wearable device that tracks when your child gets near something dangerous, like if they\u2019re submerged in water or if they fall suddenly.The system includes a receiver, bracelets, and monitoring tags. You use the tags to determine danger areas, and if your child approaches it while wearing the monitoring bracelet, it alerts your phone and speaks the alert aloud over the receiver.\nYou can also buy a \u201crepeater\u201d that extends the coverage much in the same way a wifi extender extends your wifi coverage. The TikiSmart is bound to get a lot of buzz, likely both negative and positive, but for parents with family pools, a pond, or even a fire pit, the allure will likely be hard to resist.\u2014 CB\nThe Toniebox is one of the best storytelling devices, in our opinion, and they\u2019re coming out with some fantastic new characters that they\u2019re debuting at CES.Sara Llama is the Yoga Tonie, and she\u2019ll guide your child through four stories, each with a theme central to yoga, like friendship and confidence. There\u2019s Juniper, the potty training Tonie that uses stories to help your child prepare for potty training. And finally, there\u2019s Mo, the mindfulness Tonie that walks your child through mindful activities through his stories.\u2014 CB\nStefan is the senior technology editor for Best Products, where he\u2019s been covering the tech industry and testing the latest gadgets since 2015. He is an award-winning editor with more than a decade of experience reporting on and reviewing consumer tech products, especially smartphones, tablets, laptops, and audio gear like headphones, earbuds, speakers, and soundbars. Stefan was previously the U.S. editor for GSMArena.com. His work can also be found on Popular Mechanics and other Hearst publications.\nCat Bowen has been covering parenting and home for over a decade.

(\u201cOwlet\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE:OWLT), the pioneer of smart infant monitoring, today announces the launch and availability of Dream Sock\u00ae and BabySat\u2122, two medical devices with recent clearances from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). Both innovations deliver real-time health insights with medical-grade accuracy and unprecedented advancements for at-home infant care.\n\u201cWe are on a mission to help parents monitor what matters most and are proud to now offer two FDA-cleared, at-home infant monitors to countless parents who want and need more information on their baby\u2019s well-being,\u201d said Kurt Workman, Owlet Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder. \u201cBoth the FDA-cleared Dream Sock and BabySat devices are a representation of our endless commitment to providing clarity and peace of mind for parents, while also setting new standards in the industry of infant care.\u201d\nAccording to a survey, parents lose a staggering 133 nights of sleep during the first year of their newborn\u2019s life1. Additionally, parents will experience more than three million emergency care visits for their infants each year2, and, annually, more than two million children under the age of five have outpatient visits for respiratory syncytial virus (\u201cRSV\u201d)3. Dream Sock and BabySat are designed to arm caregivers with the tools to combat these common stressors \u2013 being clinically proven to accurately track and display an infant\u2019s vital signs and notify parents in real-time so they can take action if required.\nFDA-Cleared Dream Sock\nSince achieving its De Novo clearance from the FDA in November 2023, Dream Sock continues to be the first-of-its-kind medical pulse oximetry solution for infants without the need for a prescription. Rigorously tested in both hospital and at-home environments and found to be compliant with all relevant performance and safety standards, the Dream Sock device provides accurate and actionable data to parents.\n\u201cDream Sock is a breakthrough product for the industry and expands our medical-grade monitoring technology to all consumers,\u201d said Dr. Alisa Niksch, Pediatric Cardiologist and Senior Director of Medical Affairs at Owlet. \u201cThis device will equip parents of otherwise healthy babies with the real-time data they need to make informed care decisions for their infants. Owlet is dedicated to advancing the capabilities of Dream Sock to enhance care for infants in the home.\u201d\nCaregivers of healthy babies between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs can now track their infant\u2019s Live Health Readings, including pulse rate and oxygen saturation level, in the Owlet Dream App (iOS & Android), as well as receive real-time Health Notifications for low pulse rate, high pulse rate, and low oxygen. These features are available to both existing and new Dream Sock users who opt to enable these features in the Dream App.\nFDA-Cleared BabySat\nThe BabySat pulse oximetry monitoring system combines hospital-grade accuracy with Owlet\u2019s modern and wire-free sock design, and is intended for infants between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs with acute or chronic medical conditions. BabySat also provides the ability to track live vital signs, but is distinct from Owlet\u2019s Dream Sock in that it is available through prescription only, and allows a healthcare provider to set and adjust customizable alarms for oxygen saturation and pulse rate that are tailored to an infant\u2019s individual needs.\nResearch shows there is a 40% decrease in mortality rates with the use of in-home pulse oximetry monitoring to track oxygen saturation levels for complex congenital heart disease in infants4. The availability of the BabySat pulse oximeter for more vulnerable infant populations better connects healthcare providers and caregivers, and ultimately allows caregivers to more confidently care for their little ones at home. BabySat will also be eligible for insurance reimbursement, increasing affordability and further democratizing access to these advanced monitoring tools. Additional details on BabySat prescription, fulfillment, and insurance reimbursement will be announced soon.\n\u201cThe launch of BabySat is a huge accomplishment for both parents and providers to enhance care coordination outside of the hospital,\u201d said Jim Fidacaro, Owlet Senior Vice President and General Manager of Healthcare. \u201cIt extends medical-grade, personalized infant care to the home environment, and with oversight from a physician, parents of babies with health conditions can feel more in control of their little one\u2019s well-being.\u201d\nOwlet is committed to offering products that set a new standard in infant care, combining advanced technology with ease of use to help caregivers have increased peace of mind while monitoring what matters most. For more details on each device and to find out which product is the right choice for your family, visit www.owletcare.com.\nAbout Owlet, Inc.\nOwlet was founded by a team of parents in 2012.

(\u201cOwlet\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE:OWLT), the pioneer of smart infant monitoring, today announces the launch and availability of Dream Sock\u00ae and BabySat\u2122, two medical devices with recent clearances from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). Both innovations deliver real-time health insights with medical-grade accuracy and unprecedented advancements for at-home infant care.\n\u201cWe are on a mission to help parents monitor what matters most and are proud to now offer two FDA-cleared, at-home infant monitors to countless parents who want and need more information on their baby\u2019s well-being,\u201d said Kurt Workman, Owlet Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder. \u201cBoth the FDA-cleared Dream Sock and BabySat devices are a representation of our endless commitment to providing clarity and peace of mind for parents, while also setting new standards in the industry of infant care.\u201d\nAccording to a survey, parents lose a staggering 133 nights of sleep during the first year of their newborn\u2019s life1. Additionally, parents will experience more than three million emergency care visits for their infants each year2, and, annually, more than two million children under the age of five have outpatient visits for respiratory syncytial virus (\u201cRSV\u201d)3. Dream Sock and BabySat are designed to arm caregivers with the tools to combat these common stressors \u2013 being clinically proven to accurately track and display an infant\u2019s vital signs and notify parents in real-time so they can take action if required.\nFDA-Cleared Dream Sock\nSince achieving its De Novo clearance from the FDA in November 2023, Dream Sock continues to be the first-of-its-kind medical pulse oximetry solution for infants without the need for a prescription. Rigorously tested in both hospital and at-home environments and found to be compliant with all relevant performance and safety standards, the Dream Sock device provides accurate and actionable data to parents.\n\u201cDream Sock is a breakthrough product for the industry and expands our medical-grade monitoring technology to all consumers,\u201d said Dr. Alisa Niksch, Pediatric Cardiologist and Senior Director of Medical Affairs at Owlet. \u201cThis device will equip parents of otherwise healthy babies with the real-time data they need to make informed care decisions for their infants. Owlet is dedicated to advancing the capabilities of Dream Sock to enhance care for infants in the home.\u201d\nCaregivers of healthy babies between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs can now track their infant\u2019s Live Health Readings, including pulse rate and oxygen saturation level, in the Owlet Dream App (iOS & Android), as well as receive real-time Health Notifications for low pulse rate, high pulse rate, and low oxygen. These features are available to both existing and new Dream Sock users who opt to enable these features in the Dream App.\nFDA-Cleared BabySat\nThe BabySat pulse oximetry monitoring system combines hospital-grade accuracy with Owlet\u2019s modern and wire-free sock design, and is intended for infants between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs with acute or chronic medical conditions. BabySat also provides the ability to track live vital signs, but is distinct from Owlet\u2019s Dream Sock in that it is available through prescription only, and allows a healthcare provider to set and adjust customizable alarms for oxygen saturation and pulse rate that are tailored to an infant\u2019s individual needs.\nResearch shows there is a 40% decrease in mortality rates with the use of in-home pulse oximetry monitoring to track oxygen saturation levels for complex congenital heart disease in infants4. The availability of the BabySat pulse oximeter for more vulnerable infant populations better connects healthcare providers and caregivers, and ultimately allows caregivers to more confidently care for their little ones at home. BabySat will also be eligible for insurance reimbursement, increasing affordability and further democratizing access to these advanced monitoring tools. Additional details on BabySat prescription, fulfillment, and insurance reimbursement will be announced soon.\n\u201cThe launch of BabySat is a huge accomplishment for both parents and providers to enhance care coordination outside of the hospital,\u201d said Jim Fidacaro, Owlet Senior Vice President and General Manager of Healthcare. \u201cIt extends medical-grade, personalized infant care to the home environment, and with oversight from a physician, parents of babies with health conditions can feel more in control of their little one\u2019s well-being.\u201d\nOwlet is committed to offering products that set a new standard in infant care, combining advanced technology with ease of use to help caregivers have increased peace of mind while monitoring what matters most. For more details on each device and to find out which product is the right choice for your family, visit www.owletcare.com.\nAbout Owlet, Inc.\nOwlet was founded by a team of parents in 2012.

(\u201cOwlet\u201d or the \u201cCompany\u201d) (NYSE:OWLT) today reported financial results for the fourth quarter and fiscal year ended December 31, 2022. Owlet\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and President, Kurt Workman, and Chief Financial Officer, Kate Scolnick, will host a conference call to review the Company\u2019s results and provide a business update today, March 15, 2023, at 4:30 p.m. ET.\n\u201cWe have significant conviction in Owlet\u2019s fundamentals and our vision for the future. I recognize that our confidence in our business conflicts with our reported 2022 financial results due to the efforts required to rebuild our business. Throughout 2022, we made tremendous progress positioning Owlet for sustainable, profitable growth in 2023 and years into the future. We rebuilt our brand health, rebased our operating expenses, focused on rebuilding channel health, and made milestone progress towards regulatory approval for both our medical device and de novo product applications,\u201d said Kurt Workman, Owlet Chief Executive Officer, President, and Co-Founder.\n\u201cA few weeks ago, with Owlet\u2019s underlying business properly positioned, we completed our private placement and raised $30 million of additional capital from both prior and new investors, ensuring that we have the balance sheet to execute our plans in 2023 from a position of strength. The investors who provided us with this new capital based their confidence on the fundamental improvements and strategy,\u201d Workman continued. \u201cOur plan for 2023 is clear. Positioning Owlet on the pathway to positive cash flow and profitable and long-term sustainable growth through category-defining products. There are a few underlying trends in our business that give me confidence that Owlet is on track to deliver this, including:\n\u201cOwlet weathered significant change in 2022. Today, Owlet is now in a position to drive execution of our strategic plans, and we understand the best way to build trust with the market is to deliver results each quarter. As we progress through the year, we expect to deliver results that demonstrate what we experience internally, an organization that is on track to be profitable and growing, with numerous avenues for future growth, including organic marketplace opportunities, regulatory clearances and new products for our connected nursery portfolio.\u201d Workman concluded.\nFinancial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended December 31, 2022\nFourth Quarter 2022 Results\nRevenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 were approximately $12 million.\nSell-in revenue to retailers and distributors was higher in the first half of 2022 when the Company introduced the Dream line of products in the marketplace. Sell-through product demand for the Dream product line increased with consumers over the course of 2022, and we expect that sell-in revenue will follow in future periods.\nCost of revenues for the fourth quarter of 2022 was approximately $8.6 million with a gross margin of 27.5%. The fourth quarter 2022 gross margins were impacted by inventory obsolescence and adjustments, purchase price variance costs related to prior periods and promotional discounts.\nOperating expenses were approximately $24.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $27.3 million for the same period in 2021. The decrease in year-over-year operating expenses was primarily attributed to reduced marketing spend and employee costs. Operating expenses declined sequentially each quarter during fiscal 2022 as the Company focused on reducing cost across the business, completing regulatory submissions and achieving EBITDA margin loss profitability in 2023.\nOperating loss and net loss were approximately $20.7 million and $19.5 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $33.3 million and $24.1 million, respectively, for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA loss was approximately $15.2 million in fourth quarter 2022, compared to $31.3 million for the fourth quarter of 2021.\nNet loss per share was $0.17 for the fourth quarter of 2022, compared to $0.22 for the fourth quarter of 2021. Adjusted net loss per share was $0.14 for fourth quarter 2022, compared to adjusted net loss per share of $0.29 for the same period of 2021.\nFiscal Year 2022 Results\nFor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, revenues were approximately $69.2 million, compared to $75.8 million for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021.\nCost of revenues for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 was $45.9 million, compared to $40.8 million for the 2021 fiscal year.\nFor fiscal year 2022, gross margin was 33.7%, compared to 46.3% for fiscal year 2021.\nOperating expenses for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 were $107.9 million, compared to $90.9 million for the 2021 fiscal year. The increase in year-over-year operating expenses was primarily related to spending associated with launching Dream Sock in the first half of 2022. In the second half of 2022, the Company reduced marketing spend, employee costs and variable expenses, which we anticipate will position the Company for future profitability in 2023.\nOperating loss and net loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 were $84.6 million and $79.3 million, respectively, compared to $55.8 million and $71.7 million, respectively, for the 2021 fiscal year.\nEBITDA loss for fiscal year 2022 was $76.8 million, compared to $42.7 million for fiscal year 2021.\nAdjusted EBITDA loss for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 was $68.3 million, compared to $45.2 million for the 2021 fiscal year.\nNet loss per share for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022 was $0.71, compared to $1.13 for fiscal year 2021. Adjusted net loss per share was $0.64 for fiscal year 2022, compared to $0.76 for fiscal year 2021. \u200b\nFinancial Outlook\nThe Company will speak to its financial outlook as part of the business update provided during Owlet\u2019s conference call on March 15, 2023 at 4:30 p.m. ET. Conference call details are provided below and on the Company\u2019s Investor Relations website at www.investors.owletcare.com.\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements and Projections\nThis release contains certain statements that are \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (the \u201cReform Act\u201d). Generally, forward-looking statements include the words \u201cestimate,\u201d \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d \u201cgoal,\u201d \u201cpotential,\u201d \u201cupcoming,\u201d \u201coutlook,\u201d \u201cguidance,\u201d the negation thereof, or similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company\u2019s expectations at the time such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors. For all such forward-looking statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Reform Act. The Company\u2019s actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements.\nMany important factors could affect the Company\u2019s future results and cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the Company\u2019s forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to: (i) the regulatory pathway for Owlet\u2019s products, including submissions to, actions taken by and decisions and responses from regulators, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and similar regulators outside of the United States, as well as Owlet\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval or certification for our products and other regulatory requirements and legal proceedings; (ii) Owlet\u2019s competition and the Company\u2019s ability to profitably grow and manage growth; (iii) the Company\u2019s ability to enhance future operating and financial results or obtain additional financing to continue as a going concern; (iv) Owlet\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future, as well risks associated with the Company\u2019s current loan and debt agreements, including compliance with debt covenants, restrictions on the Company\u2019s access to capital, the impact of the Company\u2019s overall debt levels and the Company\u2019s ability to generate sufficient future cash flows to meet Owlet\u2019s debt service obligations and operate Owlet\u2019s business; (v) the ability of Owlet to implement strategic initiatives, reduce costs, grow revenues, develop new products, innovate and enhance existing products, meet customer demands and adapt to changes in consumer preferences and retail trends; (vi) Owlet\u2019s ability to acquire, defend and protect its intellectual property and satisfy regulatory requirements, including but not limited to requirements concerning privacy and data protection, breaches and loss, as well as other risks associated with Owlet\u2019s digital platforms and technologies; (vii) Owlet\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, manufacturers and suppliers and retain Owlet\u2019s management and key employees; (viii) Owlet\u2019s ability to upgrade and maintain its information technology systems; (ix) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (x) the impact of and disruption to Owlet\u2019s business, financial condition, operations, supply chain and logistics due to economic and other conditions beyond the Company\u2019s control, such as health epidemics or pandemics, macro-economic uncertainties, social unrest, hostilities, natural disasters or other catastrophic events; (xi) the possibility that Owlet may be adversely affected by other economic, business, regulatory, competitive or other factors, such as changes in discretionary consumer spending and consumer preferences; and (xii) other risks and uncertainties set forth in the Company\u2019s other releases, public statements and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, including those identified in the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d sections of the Company\u2019s Annual Reports on Form 10-K and Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q.\nAll future written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on the Company\u2019s behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to above. Moreover, Owlet operates in an evolving environment. In addition to the factors described above, new risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and factors that the Company currently deems immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for the Company to predict such events or how they may affect Owlet.\nExcept as required by federal securities laws, the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this release, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, although Owlet may do so from time to time. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\nDisclosure Regarding Non-GAAP Financial Measures\nIn addition to the financial measures presented in this release in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), the Company has included certain non-GAAP financial measures in this release, including EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share.\nThe Company uses such non-GAAP financial measures as internal measures of business operating performance and as performance measures for benchmarking against the Company\u2019s peers and competitors. The Company believes its presentation of EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share provide a meaningful perspective of the underlying operating performance of our current business and enables investors to better understand and evaluate its historical and prospective operating performance. The Company believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are important supplemental measures of operating performance because they exclude items that vary from period to period without correlation to the Company\u2019s core operating performance and highlight trends in its business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on GAAP financial measures. Due to the nature of the items being excluded, such items do not reflect future gains, losses, expenses or benefits and are not indicative of the Company\u2019s future operating performance. The Company believes investors, analysts and other interested parties use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share in evaluating issuers, and the presentation of these measures facilitates a comparative assessment of the Company\u2019s operating performance in addition to the Company\u2019s performance based on GAAP results.\nThe Company\u2019s non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered as an alternative to net loss or net loss per share as a measure of financial performance or any other performance measure derived in accordance with GAAP, and should not be construed as an inference that the Company\u2019s future results will be unaffected by unusual or non-recurring items. EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for income tax provision, interest expense, interest expense from contingent beneficial conversion feature, interest income, and depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net loss adjusted for income tax provision, interest expense, interest expense from contingent beneficial conversion feature, interest income, depreciation and amortization, restructuring costs, warrant liability adjustments, gain on loan forgiveness, stock-based compensation, transaction costs and loss on extinguishment of debt. Adjusted net loss is defined as net loss adjusted for interest expense from contingent beneficial conversion feature, restructuring costs, warrant liability adjustments, gain on loan forgiveness, stock-based compensation, transaction costs and loss on extinguishment of debt. Adjusted net loss per share is defined as adjusted net loss divided by weighted-average shares of common stock.\nEBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share are not recognized terms under GAAP, and the Company\u2019s presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures does not replace the presentation of the Company\u2019s financial results in accordance with GAAP. Because all companies do not use EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, adjusted net loss and adjusted net loss per share (and similarly titled financial measures) in the same way, those measures as used by other companies may not be consistent with the way the Company calculates such measures. The non-GAAP financial measures included in this release should not be construed as substitutes for or better indicators of the Company\u2019s performance than the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. See the reconciliation tables that accompany this release for additional information regarding certain of the non-GAAP financial measures included herein.\nConference Call and Webcast Information\nOwlet will host a conference call and audio webcast today, March 15, 2023, at 4:30 p.m. ET to discuss these results.\nTo access the conference call by telephone, please dial (833) 470-1428 (domestic) or +1 (929) 526-1599 (international) and reference Access Code 713225.

Owlet is a leader in infant health data, having monitored more than 1 million babies, and with BabySat, combines its consumer-first expertise with hospital-grade monitoring accuracy.\n\"Our mission is to provide caregivers with the right information at the right time to make informed decisions about their baby\u2019s health,\" said Kurt Workman, Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder. \"Today, parents whose babies need additional monitoring are sent home with traditional solutions that can be restrictive and more cumbersome for parents. BabySat pushes forward the modernization of hospital-grade technology for at-home use, and underscores our commitment to transforming baby care solutions.\"\nInnovation in the baby care space matters because some of the largest issues facing caregivers and healthcare providers have yet to be solved. For example, there are roughly 92 million infant care visits covering a child\u2019s first four years of life, significantly straining the availability of hospital beds and quality of care.\nBabySat is a step forward in solving some of these exact challenges by bringing real-time medical grade infant monitoring into the home, while under the supervision of a physician. Available through prescription, BabySat uses pulse oximetry technology to provide a real-time display of their baby\u2019s heart rate and oxygen saturation level (SpO2) and alerts parents when these readings fall outside of prescribed ranges. With access to this information and under the supervision of a physician, caregivers are enabled to feel confident in providing at-home care for their families\u2013helping to reduce the strain on our valued medical resources.\nThe addition of the FDA-cleared BabySat device expands on Owlet\u2019s existing portfolio of consumer products designed to bring peace of mind to caregivers. BabySat will be available in the U.S. only and is targeted to launch later this year.

(\"Owlet\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE:OWLT), the pioneer of smart infant monitoring, today announces the launch and availability of Dream Sock\u00ae and BabySat\u2122, two medical devices with recent clearances from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\"FDA\"). Both innovations deliver real-time health insights with medical-grade accuracy and unprecedented advancements for at-home infant care.\n\"We are on a mission to help parents monitor what matters most and are proud to now offer two FDA-cleared, at-home infant monitors to countless parents who want and need more information on their baby's well-being,\" said Kurt Workman, Owlet Chief Executive Officer and Co-Founder. \"Both the FDA-cleared Dream Sock and BabySat devices are a representation of our endless commitment to providing clarity and peace of mind for parents, while also setting new standards in the industry of infant care.\"\nAccording to a survey, parents lose a staggering 133 nights of sleep during the first year of their newborn's life1. Additionally, parents will experience more than three million emergency care visits for their infants each year2, and, annually, more than two million children under the age of five have outpatient visits for respiratory syncytial virus (\"RSV\")3. Dream Sock and BabySat are designed to arm caregivers with the tools to combat these common stressors - being clinically proven to accurately track and display an infant's vital signs and notify parents in real-time so they can take action if required.\nFDA-Cleared Dream Sock\nSince achieving its De Novo clearance from the FDA in November 2023, Dream Sock continues to be the first-of-its-kind medical pulse oximetry solution for infants without the need for a prescription. Rigorously tested in both hospital and at-home environments and found to be compliant with all relevant performance and safety standards, the Dream Sock device provides accurate and actionable data to parents.\n\"Dream Sock is a breakthrough product for the industry and expands our medical-grade monitoring technology to all consumers,\" said Dr. Alisa Niksch, Pediatric Cardiologist and Senior Director of Medical Affairs at Owlet. \"This device will equip parents of otherwise healthy babies with the real-time data they need to make informed care decisions for their infants. Owlet is dedicated to advancing the capabilities of Dream Sock to enhance care for infants in the home.\"\nCaregivers of healthy babies between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs can now track their infant's Live Health Readings, including pulse rate and oxygen saturation level, in the Owlet Dream App (iOS & Android), as well as receive real-time Health Notifications for low pulse rate, high pulse rate, and low oxygen. These features are available to both existing and new Dream Sock users who opt to enable these features in the Dream App.\nFDA-Cleared BabySat\nThe BabySat pulse oximetry monitoring system combines hospital-grade accuracy with Owlet's modern and wire-free sock design, and is intended for infants between 1-18 months and 6-30 lbs with acute or chronic medical conditions. BabySat also provides the ability to track live vital signs, but is distinct from Owlet's Dream Sock in that it is available through prescription only, and allows a healthcare provider to set and adjust customizable alarms for oxygen saturation and pulse rate that are tailored to an infant's individual needs.\nResearch shows there is a 40% decrease in mortality rates with the use of in-home pulse oximetry monitoring to track oxygen saturation levels for complex congenital heart disease in infants4. The availability of the BabySat pulse oximeter for more vulnerable infant populations better connects healthcare providers and caregivers, and ultimately allows caregivers to more confidently care for their little ones at home. BabySat will also be eligible for insurance reimbursement, increasing affordability and further democratizing access to these advanced monitoring tools. Additional details on BabySat prescription, fulfillment, and insurance reimbursement will be announced soon.\n\"The launch of BabySat is a huge accomplishment for both parents and providers to enhance care coordination outside of the hospital,\" said Jim Fidacaro, Owlet Senior Vice President and General Manager of Healthcare. \"It extends medical-grade, personalized infant care to the home environment, and with oversight from a physician, parents of babies with health conditions can feel more in control of their little one's well-being.\"\nOwlet is committed to offering products that set a new standard in infant care, combining advanced technology with ease of use to help caregivers have increased peace of mind while monitoring what matters most.

All statements contained in this press release that do not relate to matters of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements regarding the Company's growth prospects, expanded product offerings and the impacts of the Company's new FDA-cleared medical devices. In some cases, you can identify forward-looking statements by terms such as \"estimate,\" \"may,\" \"believes,\" \"plans,\" \"expects,\" \"anticipates,\" \"intends,\" \"goal,\" \"potential,\" \"upcoming,\" \"outlook,\" \"guidance,\" the negation thereof, or similar expressions, although not all forward-looking statements contain these identifying words. Forward-looking statements are based on the Company's expectations at the time such statements are made, speak only as of the dates they are made and are susceptible to a number of risks, uncertainties and other factors. For all such forward-looking statements, the Company claims the protection of the safe harbor for forward-looking statements contained in the Reform Act. The Company's actual results, performance or achievements may differ materially from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by our forward-looking statements. Many important factors could affect the Company's future results and cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in or implied by the Company's forward-looking statements. Such factors include, but are not limited to, (i) the regulatory pathway for Owlet's products, including submissions to, actions taken by and decisions and responses from regulators, such as the FDA and similar regulators outside of the United States, as well as Owlet's ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approval or certification for our products and other regulatory requirements and legal proceedings; (ii) Owlet's competition and the Company's ability to profitably grow and manage growth; (iii) the Company's ability to enhance future operating and financial results or obtain additional financing to continue as a going concern; (iv) Owlet's ability to obtain additional financing in the future, as well risks associated with the Company's current loan and debt agreements, including compliance with debt covenants, restrictions on the Company's access to capital, the impact of the Company's overall debt levels and the Company's ability to generate sufficient future cash flows to meet Owlet's debt service obligations and operate Owlet's business; (v) the ability of Owlet to implement strategic initiatives, reduce costs, grow revenues, develop and launch new products, innovate and enhance existing products, meet customer demands and adapt to changes in consumer preferences and retail trends; (vi) Owlet's ability to acquire, defend and protect its intellectual property and satisfy regulatory requirements, including but not limited to requirements concerning privacy and data protection, breaches and loss, as well as other risks associated with Owlet's digital platforms and technologies; (vii) Owlet's ability to maintain relationships with customers, manufacturers and suppliers and retain Owlet's management and key employees; (viii) Owlet's ability to upgrade and maintain its information technology systems; (ix) changes in applicable laws or regulations; (x) the impact of and disruption to Owlet's business, financial condition, operations, supply chain and logistics due to economic and other conditions beyond the Company's control, such as health epidemics or pandemics, macro-economic uncertainties, social unrest, hostilities, natural disasters or other catastrophic events; (xi) the possibility that Owlet may be adversely affected by other economic, business, regulatory, competitive or other factors, such as changes in discretionary consumer spending and consumer preferences; and (xii) other risks and uncertainties set forth in the Company's other releases, public statements and filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\"), including those identified in the \"Risk Factors\" section of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2022, as updated in the Company's Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the quarterly periods ended March 31, 2023, June 30, 2023 and September 30, 2023 and as any such factors may be updated from time to time in the Company's other filings with the SEC. All such forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on the Company's behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to above. Moreover, the Company operates in an evolving environment. New risk factors and uncertainties may emerge from time to time, and factors that the Company currently deems immaterial may become material, and it is impossible for the Company to predict such events or how they may affect Owlet. Except as required by law, the Company assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements after the date of this press release, whether because of new information, future events or otherwise, although Owlet may do so from time to time. The Company does not endorse any projections regarding future performance that may be made by third parties.\nhttps://www.snuz.co.uk/sleep-centre/news/the-truth-about-sleep-snuz-sleep-survey-results/\nhttps://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK526418/\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/rsv/research/index.html\nhttps://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/JAHA.119.014548\n\u00c2\nView source version on businesswire.com:\nhttps://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108878830/en/\n[ Back To TMCnet.com's Homepage ]\nUPCOMING WEBINARS\nFEATURED WHITEPAPERS\nSign up to receive our updates and other TMCnet news!\nQuick Links\nSUBSCRIPTIONS\nPowered by\nTMC\n\u00a9 2024 Technology Marketing Corporation.
