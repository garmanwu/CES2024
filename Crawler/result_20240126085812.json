Naqi Logix \u2014 a neural interface developer \u2014 is one such company, seeking to make assisted living devices more accessible.\nYahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita explores the functionality of Naqi Logix's earbuds which function as a non-invasive brain implant to engage with various home devices. She meets with Naqi Logix Founder David Segal and Director of Product Management Zavier Alexander to discuss the use cases of such technology.\nClick here\u00a0to view more of Yahoo Finance's coverage of CES 2024 this week, or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\nVideo Transcript\nAKIKO FUJITA: \"Yahoo Finance's\" is on the ground here in Sin City, Las Vegas at CES 2024. It is one of the largest tech conferences in the world. We're here to give you the inside scoop on the technologies that will educate and enlighten and transform your portfolio.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nHe's able to type by looking.\nZAVIER ALEXANDER:\u00a0Exactly.\nAKIKO FUJITA:\u00a0Can we have him spell \"Yahoo Finance?\"\nZAVIER ALEXANDER:\u00a0Sure.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nAKIKO FUJITA: We are here with Naqi Logix. It's a neural interface company that allows you to control digital devices like a laptop hands-free with this earpiece and facial gestures. He's not touching anything.\nZAVIER ALEXANDER: He's not touching anything. So this is totally hands-free right now. Totally, hands-free and voice-free. He's just looking at the text that he wants to type. And then it is being typed on screen.\nAKIKO FUJITA:\u00a0That is incredible. So this is all you need, the small earpiece.\nZAVIER ALEXANDER:\u00a0Exactly. You can play a video game. You can fly a flight simulator. Dave can fly a 737 in the flight simulator on his computer.\n-\u00a0Look straight. Look up. Looking at the top panel.\n-\u00a01,000 sink rate. Pull up. Pull up. Pull up. Pull up.\nDAVID SEGAL: I'm confident, if we can fly a 737 with nothing but an earbud, you can control anything and everything. And is that not the goal of implants?\nAKIKO FUJITA:\u00a0Well, then you don't need to implant the chip.\nDAVID SEGAL: There you have it. That's why we're here at CES. I'm not against brain implants. That's very important to know because I think brain implants are very, very important for certain aspects of society. Those who are truly locked in, those who have severe neurological disorders, where technology like Naqi may not be a fit.\nBut for somebody who you want to consider a typical quadriplegic and healthier from that level up to and including healthy, able-bodied people like us--\nAKIKO FUJITA:\u00a0Yeah.\nDAVID SEGAL: --this is the ability to almost telepathically hands-free, voice-free, and screen-free, control everything with nothing but a wearable.\nRecent Posts\n11 genius accessories from CES 2024: from AI fitness headphones to infrared hairdryers\nResidential Systems, TWICE, and TechRadar Pro Announce Picks Awards Winners for CES 2024\n\u2018Neural\u2019 headphones are big at CES \u2013 four fascinating products coming soon here\nLET'S WORK TOGETHER\nNAQI is a revolutionary technology platform that transforms our inconspicuous micro-gestures into instant commands to control all the devices where we work, live or play.\nNaqi Logix Inc.\ninfo @ naqilogix.com\n888-NAQILOG\n888-627-4564\nSTRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS\nInterested in collaborating or piloting a project with us?

        "raw_content": "When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission. Here\u2019s how it works.\n'Neural' headphones are big at CES \u2013 here are 4 fascinating products coming soon\nThe latest innovations in headphones tap into auditory nerves\nIncreasingly, competitors for the best headphones aren't just focused on delivering top-quality audio. Every year it seems that new strings are being added to their bow, and a big thing we're seeing in buds and headphones at CES 2024 are 'neural' technologies.\nWe also saw a couple more interesting earbuds pushing the boundaries of headphones tech, including TimeKettle's new multi-device X1 two-way translator earbuds and BREGGZ's in-ear computer wireless earbuds, which also have a translation app. With Samsung also looking to add real-time translation to its next Galaxy Buds, it's safe to say this is a tech we'll be hearing a lot more about.\nBut the idea of headphones being able to read minds is \u2013 in our opinion \u2013 even more outlandish, and therefore interesting. I've rounded up four neural headphones I spotted at CES 2024, all with very different designs.\n1. Naqi Neural Earbuds\nBrain implants sound like the stuff of science fiction but there are plenty of companies working on developing this tech for the consumer market. In this case, it's a company called Naqi Logix, which was co-founded by Dave Segal four years ago in Canada.\nSegal tells me that the reason he invented wearable tech that could use electric signals from the brain to control various devices, from smart home electronics to even flight simulators, was inspired by a wish to help a friend who had become quadriplegic.\n\"We build the only neural earbuds on planet Earth that can serve as a safe, non-invasive alternative to brain implants. [They offer] the ability to have a full command of control over Windows and Mac computers, including typing, browsing, shopping and playing contemporary video games,\" Segal explains.\nThe idea behind the earbuds, which use gyroscopic, muscle and brainwave sensors, is that the computer interface tech inside them could be used in any of the best wireless earbuds to give them this added control. Given its ability to completely transform lives, it's no wonder why the Naqi Neural Earbuds was a CES Innovation Award honoree for accessibility and aging tech.\n2. NeurGear ZenBud\nInstead of sensing nerves and translating those signals to control a device like the Neural Earbuds above, NeurGear's ZenBud headset uses ultrasonic sound waves to relax you. The tech works by stimulating what's called the Vagus nerve, which is responsible for various bodily functions such as digestion, heart rate and breathing.\nJohn Hacker, the founder and CEO of NearGear, explained to me that by stimulating a person's Vagus nerve, it triggers a rest response, which sends calming signals to the brain. This helps to \"strengthen your stress resilience and your ability to relax. By using it just five minutes for a week, you can see marked increases in stress resilience and relaxation\".\nWhile the ZenBud is still in its early stages \u2013 NeurGear was only founded in 2021 \u2013 ultrasound tech like this could be rolled out to the best earbuds in the future. But if you want to try it out sooner then, as part of NeurGear's Kickstarter campaign, you can pre-order it now for $1 and receive a $100 discount off the purchase price, which is not yet known.\n3. MyWaves Technologies Pebble\nPitched more as a headphone accessory, the myWaves Pebble device, which you can see in the picture above, attaches to your forehead to analyze your brain waves while sleeping to create custom music tracks that it claims will help you sleep.\n\"We have a science-backed technology that basically uses your delta waves, which are linked in your brain to sleep, to tell you all the activities of your sleep, from deep sleep to rapid eye movement (REM). By selecting a very specific part of your [delta waves while] sleep and turning it into music, we can produce music that triggers your brain to fall asleep quicker, longer and better,\" Jean Francois Destexhe, the CEO of myWaves Technologies, says.\nDestexhe assures me that this device isn't meant to be worn every night, though. Instead, the idea is that you wear it for one night to get the recording. You then upload it to myWaves' platform, which next transforms your \"brainwaves into lullabies to help you fall asleep faster\".\nYou can currently sign up for early access to the tech, which was originally invented by Alain Destexhe and Luc Foubert, who are researchers of the Paris-Saclay Institute of Neuroscience (NeuroPSI),\u00a0and receive a 40% discount off the price when it does become available.\n4. Earable Neuroscience Frenz Brainband\nAnother company focusing on finding a solution to falling and staying asleep is Earable Neuroscience, which has been running since 2018 with the help of the University of Colorado and University of Oxford. Like myWaves, it also tracks your brain's signals to create a custom music track that promises to help you sleep but it instead has a developed a physical headset that you can wear above your ears.\nThe headset itself uses the same tech as the best bone conduction headphones to play the music, which Kimi Doan, chief growth officer at the company, says is much less intrusive and more comfortable than placing an earbud directly in the ear while trying to sleep. She tells me that \"it tracks in real-time your brain activity signals and neuro feedbacks. Based on that, the AI will automatically personalize and select the digital therapeutics that are for your brain\".\nEarable Neuroscience currently has 18 patents in various stages of completion and is the winner of CES' Innovation Awards for 2024. It had also won the CES Awards for Wearables tech last year. If you want to be one of the first to try out its Frenz Brainband then you can pre-order it for $490, with it scheduled to be shipped by February 2024.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens.

Naqi Logix \u2014 a neural interface developer \u2014 is one such company, seeking to make assisted living devices more accessible.\nYahoo Finance's Akiko Fujita explores the functionality of Naqi Logix's earbuds which function as a non-invasive brain implant to engage with various home devices. She meets with Naqi Logix Founder David Segal and Director of Product Management Zavier Alexander to discuss the use cases of such technology.\nClick here to view more of Yahoo Finance's coverage of CES 2024 this week, or you can watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live here.\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\nVideo Transcript\nAKIKO FUJITA: \"Yahoo Finance's\" is on the ground here in Sin City, Las Vegas at CES 2024. It is one of the largest tech conferences in the world. We're here to give you the inside scoop on the technologies that will educate and enlighten and transform your portfolio.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nHe's able to type by looking.\nZAVIER ALEXANDER: Exactly.\nAKIKO FUJITA: Can we have him spell \"Yahoo Finance?\"\nZAVIER ALEXANDER: Sure.\n[MUSIC PLAYING]\nAKIKO FUJITA: We are here with Naqi Logix. It's a neural interface company that allows you to control digital devices like a laptop hands-free with this earpiece and facial gestures. He's not touching anything.\nZAVIER ALEXANDER: He's not touching anything. So this is totally hands-free right now. Totally, hands-free and voice-free. He's just looking at the text that he wants to type. And then it is being typed on screen.\nAKIKO FUJITA: That is incredible. So this is all you need, the small earpiece.\nZAVIER ALEXANDER: Exactly. You can play a video game. You can fly a flight simulator. Dave can fly a 737 in the flight simulator on his computer.\n- Look straight. Look up. Looking at the top panel.\n- 1,000 sink rate. Pull up. Pull up. Pull up. Pull up.\nDAVID SEGAL: I'm confident, if we can fly a 737 with nothing but an earbud, you can control anything and everything. And is that not the goal of implants?\nAKIKO FUJITA: Well, then you don't need to implant the chip.\nDAVID SEGAL: There you have it. That's why we're here at CES. I'm not against brain implants. That's very important to know because I think brain implants are very, very important for certain aspects of society. Those who are truly locked in, those who have severe neurological disorders, where technology like Naqi may not be a fit.\nBut for somebody who you want to consider a typical quadriplegic and healthier from that level up to and including healthy, able-bodied people like us--\nAKIKO FUJITA: Yeah.\nDAVID SEGAL: --this is the ability to almost telepathically hands-free, voice-free, and screen-free, control everything with nothing but a wearable.\nTRENDING"
