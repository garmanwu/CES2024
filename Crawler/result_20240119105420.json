The other partners will pay CNY85 million but Kotei did not disclose the shareholding ratio. However, based on a government subsidy of CNY6.5 million (USD910,000) it expected to receive, Kotei might be responsible for half of the total investment. Some of the allies include Wuhan's Huazhong University of Science and Technology, the Wuhan University of Technology, and Wuhan Artificial Intelligence Research, a research institute.\nThe goal is to develop algorithms for intelligent driving functions compatible with domestic chips, and highly safe cockpit systems for human-computer interaction, per the firm.\nLast year, Kotei recorded CNY530 million (USD74 million) in revenue and more than half of that came from its intelligent cockpit business while its smart driving business contributed less than a third of the total, and around 16 percent of the sum was earned by providing new energy vehicle software services, per the annual report.\nEditor: Emmi Laine\nRELATED\nLog in to Yicai Global\nCreate your account\nWe sent you a code\nYou'll need a password\nFind your Yicai Global account\nCheck your email\nChange your password\nReset your password"
