These range from artificial intelligence, next-generation semiconductor display, autonomous driving, robots to augmented reality.\nHighlighting that China is playing an increasingly vital role in bolstering technological innovation, experts said intelligent devices powered by generative AI and the internet of things are expected to become a key growth driver for global consumer electronics industry.\nAccording to the US Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, more than 4,000 enterprises from across the globe are participating in the CES, which opened on Tuesday and will conclude on Friday. Of these, 1,114 are from China and 1,201 are based in the US.\nAI-powered terminal devices are attracting attention this year amid a worldwide frenzy over the ChatGPT chatbot. Chinese consumer electronics maker TCL demonstrated over 120 pieces of intelligent hardware covering quantum dot mini-LED TVs, AI processing chips, smartphones, intelligent AR goggles and vehicle-mounted display products.\nThe company is accelerating efforts to expand presence in North America by boosting production capacity at its Mexican factory, given that building global competitiveness has always been important for TCL.\nHisense Group, a major Chinese home appliance manufacturer, unveiled its latest ultra light-emitting diode or ULED TV and laser display technology at the CES.\nDavid Gold, vice-president of Hisense International, said at a product launch event that display technology is widely applied in sports, education and medical fields, continuously pushing technological boundaries.\nLenovo Group Ltd, the world's largest personal computer maker, unveiled a full lineup of more than 40 new devices and solutions powered by AI at the CES. It said it believes this year will mark the advent of AI-based PCs.\nXpeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's Xpeng Motors, showcased its pilotless flying car, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft at the CES.\n\"Chinese tech companies are at the forefront of technological innovation globally, and actively promoting the application of AI in consumer electronics, intelligent devices and electric vehicles,\" said Hong Yong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe latest technological breakthroughs made by Chinese companies in the fields of virtual reality and autonomous driving also reflect their strengths and innovative capabilities in crucial technologies, which will be conducive to industrial upgrades and boosting their own competitiveness on the global stage, Hong said.\nChinese augmented reality company Xreal showcased its latest AR-enabled innovative products by partnering with companies such as Qualcomm and BMW.\nCES attendees can join a Las Vegas tour hosted by BMW, where they will have the opportunity to experience Xreal's AR glasses along the way.

Getting in touch with a local window installer is the best way to get an accurate cost estimate for your home.\nHow Installing Energy-Efficient Windows in Ashburn Saves You Money\nThere are several benefits of switching to energy-efficient windows. A few reasons you may want to consider making the switch include the following:\nEstimated Cost of Window Replacement in Ashburn\nWindows come in different styles, purposes and shapes, so costs and services will vary remarkably depending on several factors. Below, we go over the average cost and services that you'll find from window installation companies.\nHow Much Do New Windows Cost?\nAccording to our research, the national average cost to replace a single window is around $600. However, window replacement costs can range from $200 to $1,200 a window. But costs will vary significantly depending on your location, the number of windows you need, the current condition of your home and the quality of your products. Many window companies also offer door installations and other add-ons like shutters, coating, baths and more. These extra services will increase your overall project costs.\nWhether or not you want to install energy-efficient windows is another factor that will determine the cost. These will almost always cost more than other windows, but on the other hand, you can save about $353 a year on your energy bills in Ashburn.\nGetting free quotes from multiple companies is the best way to find out which one will work best for your budget.\nWhat Services do Window Installers Offer?\nThe first step when planning a window replacement is to decide whether you want a full-frame or pocket installation.\nFull-frame installations involve replacing the whole window \u2014 the sill, frame, trim and all. These are most common when you want to change the style of your window or when it has significant deterioration. Full-frame installations are more time-consuming and will increase overall costs. A pocket installation involves replacing a window within the frame that's already there. So, instead of tearing out the whole window and rebuilding it, the contractor will just put the replacement window (also called a retrofit or insert window) into the frame.\nYour window installation company should be able to help you choose which type of installation you should get.\nBest Availability\nBest Energy-Efficient Features\nWindow Veteran\nHow We Choose the Best Window Installers in Ashburn\nIn our hunt to make your home improvements easier and more eco-friendly in Ashburn, EcoWatch landed on the above companies as the best window installation companies in the city. Along with energy efficiency, we reviewed window companies all across the state and ranked them based on the following methodology:\nService Area\nBecause this is a guide for Ashburn, we only included companies that cover the city. There are other reputable providers that didn't make our list because of the low odds that they would serve the average homeowner in Ashburn.\nWork Quality\nWe're certain that you're looking for professionals who do a great job installing windows. We've vetted each installer included in our guide to ensure its technicians are well-qualified and that the company has received plenty of positive customer feedback to vouch for its service.\nCustomer Reviews\nAnother self-explanatory yet very important review factor is customer feedback. If most customers don't have positive things to say about their experience with a certain company, you won't see it featured on EcoWatch.\nCost\nCheaper windows certainly don't mean better windows, but we know many of our readers want to keep costs as low as possible. When analyzing the prices of providers, we awarded higher scores to companies with reasonable prices and accessible financing rather than \"cheaper\" services.\nWarranty\nProtecting your investment in new windows is important. For that reason, window installation companies that give you lengthy warranties for products, parts and labor rank higher with EcoWatch.\nYears of Experience\nBecause of Ashburn's climate, homeowners need to be wary of water damage, rot and low efficiency. We factored in local experience to reflect the ability of Ashburn window companies to prepare homes for the climate. If a company has less than 10 years of experience, it loses points in this category.\nAshburn, VA Window Replacement FAQs\nHow much does a window install cost?\nThe average cost of installing a single window can range between $450 and $650. There are a variety of factors that affect how much it costs, including your property's location, the materials used in designing the windows, how energy-efficient the windows are, local labor costs, styles and sizes of windows and the number of windows.\nWhat are the types of windows?\nThere are several different kinds of windows you can get for your home, including slider windows, double-hung and single-hung windows, picture windows, casement windows, awning windows, bay windows and transom windows.\nDo you really need to use a window installation company?\nYou should hire a window installation company whenever you need to replace your windows. Installing windows is a involved process that can be difficult and time-consuming, so it's best left to the professionals.\nHow do you know it's time to replace your windows?\nWindows typically have a lifespan of around 20 to 30 years, but anytime you notice damage on your windows, it's a good time to have an expert take a look at them to see if they need any repairs or replacements.\nShould I replace my windows all at once?\nIf your windows are more than 20 years old, it's probably time to replace all of them. By that point, they are usually less efficient, leakier and/or more damaged than new windows. Replacing your windows all at the same time will involve less paperwork and less time.\nOther Services in Ashburn\nMore window replacement & installers Near Me"
