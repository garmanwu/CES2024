Here\u2019s how it works.\nBest of CES 2024: Evolution and Revolution\nThough AI was a popular buzzword, faster and better designed products dominated\nCES, the world\u2019s leading trade show, is back! Yes, there were in-person versions of the show in 2022 and 2023, but this year is the first since 2020 that felt \u201cnormal.\u201d The halls were crowded full of eager attendees, the show floors were packed with booths and most of the companies we usually visit with at CES had a presence.\nGoing into the show, we expected to hear the word \u201cAI\u201d every five seconds that we talked with vendors, but in the enthusiast tech world, we heard it a bit less often than our colleagues who cover TVs, appliances and phones at other websites. Instead, it seems that nothing beats good design, more processing power and a positive user experience.\nIntel and the laptop vendors which use its CPUs showed off various local AI workloads, which mostly involved generating images or managing power profiles And AI underpins Nvidia\u2019s gaming technologies. But there are only so many times we can prompt Stable Diffusion\u2019s GIMP plugin to draw a cat driving a car, before we get bored. MSI is the one company that wowed us with a true AI innovation: a monitor that uses computer vision to analyze your game\u2019s map and point out where enemies are coming from.\nInsead, we were excited to see a number of products that really moved the ball forward in ways that were more evolutionary than revolutionary: new graphics cards and CPUs \u00a0that add more performance for the money, a high-end 3D printer that zooms along at 600 mm/s and works with carbon fiber or a gorgeous OLED monitor that can run at up to 480 Hz at 1080p or 240 Hz at 4K.\nThese are the 15 best products of CES 2024.\nBest Graphics Card: Nvidia RTX 4070 Super\nNvidia announced three new RTX 40-series Super model graphics cards, and AMD revealed its RX 7600 XT 16GB. While all four will vie for a spot on our list of the best graphics cards for gaming (and other uses), the one we're most excited about is\u2026 well, honestly it's a bit hard to nail things down. Nvidia provides more performance for a lower price than its existing non-Super cards, so things definitely moved in the right direction. AMD provides double the VRAM and slightly higher performance with its new GPU, at a higher price than the RX 7600. But none of the new models are all that surprising \u2014 we've been hearing rumors about both for several months at least. Still, if we have to just pick one for an award, it's the new RTX 4070 Super.\nFundamentally, you're getting about 93% of the RTX 4070 Ti, for 75% of the price. Alternatively, you're getting 22% more GPU than the RTX 4070 for the same price. More importantly, you're at least getting 12GB of high-speed GDDR6X memory, along with access to Nvidia's RTX technologies: DLSS, superior ray tracing, and AI tensor cores. Given the RTX 4070 already trades blows with the RX 7800 XT \u2014 slightly slower rasterization performance, much faster ray tracing and AI performance, and the RTX 4070 Ti does the same with the RX 7900 XT \u2014 Nvidia now effectively delivers a higher performance option at the same price.\nThe RTX 4070 Super launches next week, so check back then for our full review and benchmarks.\nRead more: Nvidia RTX 40-series Super models revealed\n\u2014Jarred Walton\nBest CPU: Ryzen 7 8700G and Ryzen 5 8600G\nAMD rolled out its Ryzen 8000G \u2018Phoenix\u2019 lineup of APUs at CES 2024, beating Intel to the punch as the first company to bring purpose-built AI accelerators to the desktop PC -- its second such feat after it was the first to bring AI to laptops with the same XDNA-powered neural processing unit (NPU). The chips also boast a powerful integrated RDNA 3 graphics engine that AMD claims delivers 1080p-capable gaming performance, even in some AAA titles, albeit at the reduced fidelity settings we\u2019d expect from this class of chip.\nAs we\u2019ve seen in the past, AMD builds its APUs for the desktop using the same silicon as its laptop chips. In this case, AMD leverages the Phoenix architecture that employs the Zen 4 CPU architecture and RDNA 3 graphics engine. However, the lack of battery life concerns in desktop PCs allows the chip to run at higher power limits, thus unleashing the full power of the silicon. AMD\u2019s two flagship models, the Ryzen 7 8700G and the Ryzen 5 8600G, boast eight and six cores, respectively. AMD also brought its new APU lineup up to modern standards with support for AM5\u2019s DDR5 and PCIe 4.0 connectivity, crafting what should be exceptionally powerful processors given their accessible price point.\nAMD\u2019s APUs have historically dominated the entry-level gaming market because Intel doesn\u2019t have processors with powerful enough integrated graphics to provide meaningful gaming performance, even for the lowest-end gaming systems. AMD\u2019s previous-gen Ryzen 5 5600G has long been one of the \u00a0Best CPUs for gaming \u00a0due to its surprisingly strong graphics performance, and we expect the new models to assume that mantle once again.\nThe chips feature FSR, HYPR-RX, and Fluid Motion Frames support, competitive pricing, and bundled coolers for all three SKUs. The new Ryzen APU models are poised to dominate the entry-level gaming segment once again when they arrive on January 31, winning our pick for the best CPU of CES 2024.\nRead more: AMD launches Ryzen 8000G \u2018Phoenix\u2019 APUs, brings AI to the desktop PC\n-Paul Alcorn\nBest Gaming Monitor: Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP\nWhen it comes to the best gaming monitors, you often must make some hard choices regarding performance and maximum image quality. You can go with an IPS panel and get ultra-fast 500 Hz refresh rates but compromise on contrast and color. Or you can opt for an OLED panel, which offers vibrant colors and inky blacks but falls short of class-leading refresh rate performance.\nFortunately, Asus is coming to the rescue with its ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP gaming monitor, hoping to give gamers the best of both worlds. In its standard operating mode, the PG32UCDP seems like any other modern high-end 32-inch gaming monitor with a brilliant OLED panel, a 4K (3840 x 2160) resolution, a fast 240Hz refresh rate, and a peak brightness of 1,300 nits. There\u2019s enough resolution for productivity tasks when not gaming and plenty of performance overhead for 4K gaming with the best graphics cards.\nHowever, the real spicy action happens when you switch to Frame Rate Boost mode. Gamers can quickly toggle this setting on the monitor, which drops the resolution down to Full HD (1920 x 1080) resolution and boosts the maximum refresh rate to 480 Hz. That next-level speed and performance put it on even footing with the Alienware AW2524H and AW2524HF, which have a native refresh rate of 480 Hz at Full HD resolution. However, those fraternal Alienware twins can hit 500Hz with an overlock setting in the OSD.\nStill, the ability for gamers to pick and choose when they want maximum resolution or maximum performance, all while maintaining the image quality advantages of OLED, must be commended. Asus also gets the basics right, with HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 connectivity, 90-watt USB-C Power Delivery, and an integrated KVM switch.\nWe\u2019ll be curious to see how the Asus ROG Swift OLED PG32UCDP performs once we get it in the lab.\nRead more: Asus announces two new OLED gaming monitors delivering 480 Hz at up to 1440p resolution\n--Brandon Hill\nBest Memory: Micron LPCAMM2\nMicron unveiled its new LPCAMM2 memory modules at CES 2024. Despite earlier announcements from competing companies, Micron will be the first to actually bring memory modules based on the new standard to market. Perhaps more important for those looking for the ultimate in performance, these new modules unlock speeds of 9,600 MT/s via LPDDR5X memory, a massive increase over the standard SODIMM peak of DDR5-6400. However, that\u2019s just one of the many advantages of this new memory form factor that will become common in performance-oriented laptops over the coming years.\nThe LPCAMM2 standard also promises to bring fast and power-efficient LPDDR5X memory to laptops in a removable form factor for the first time, meaning the memory chips are no longer required to be soldered directly to the motherboard. These new modules will replace the standard SODIMMs that dominate current laptops, but the innovative design consumes 80% less power and 64% less space inside the chassis, thus enabling longer battery life and even slimmer laptop designs. LPCAMM2 also provides a dual-channel memory interface from a single module, a first. The modules will come in 16, 32, and 64GB capacities at first, with room to grow up to 128GB of capacity in a single module in the future.\nThe power and space savings, not to mention the speed improvements, of Micron\u2019s LPCAMM2 are set to redefine our expectations for laptop memory, earning our award for the best memory of CES 2024.\nRead more: Micron displays next-gen LPCAMM2 modules for laptops at CES 2024\n\u2013Paul Alcorn\nBest Gaming Laptop: Asus ROG Zephyrus G14/G16\nAsus took classic, beloved laptops known for performance, portability, and even battery life, and made them sleeker than ever. The new Asus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16 are slimmer and have newer, more adult designs than before, and, well, it looks great. There's only so much you can do without a new GPU to push forward graphics, so Asus dug into the design.\nFor the G14, that does mean topping out at an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 and AMD Ryzen 9 8945HS, while the G16 uses up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and RTX 4090. Both have silver and black options with a stripe on the lid, rather than a garish massive ROG logo or AniMe Matrix. I'm not going to say it looks like it could double as a business laptop, but it's far more attractive.\nThey're also getting, on paper, really nice screens, with Asus' OLED Nebula displays. The 14-incher gets a 2880 x 1800 screen at 120 Hz, while the bigger 16-inch laptop goes to 2560 x 1600 at 240 Hz. In a brief trial, both looked great, and we're excited to see just how well they perform in real testing.\nRead more: Asus ROG Zephyrus gets a sleek, slim new look with AMD Hawk Point and Intel Core Ultra\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Laptop: Asus Zenbook Duo\nThis was a contentious category among the Tom's Hardware judges, with some favoring the HP Spectre x360 2-in-1's even approach to a refresh without reinventing the wheel, while others like the very-CES approach of the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid and its ability to run both Windows and Android with a tablet and base station. But the Asus Zenbook Duo kept coming up as an option that seemed like a refined idea at a price point that's not crazy.\nThe Zenbook Duo has a pair of 14-inch OLED displays and a detachable Bluetooth keyboard. It's an idea we first saw hit production in Lenovo's Yoga Book 9i, but that one had a U-series CPU and an origami kickstand that wasn't intuitive. Asus' Zenbook Duo's kickstand is permanently attached to the laptop, and it goes up to an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H. So it should be easier to use and more powerful. The Asus model has far more ports than the Yoga, including HDMI alongside two Thunderbolt 4 ports.\nWhile we don't have a final price for it, it's been suggested to us that it will hover around $1,500. If that sticks, it won't be a ridiculous price, considering the Yoga was almost $2,000 when we reviewed it.\nI did have a bit of trouble getting the early unit at Asus' briefing to stand up straight with the monitors side to side, but otherwise it seemed like a solid machine, and we're eager to see what it can do.\nRead more: Asus Zenbook Duo is a dual-screen foldable with two 14-inch OLED screens and Intel Core Ultra\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Gaming Handheld: MSI Claw\nOne way to make a splash at CES is to be the first to do something. And while the MSI Claw isn't the first modern handheld gaming PC, it is the first mainstream PC brand to use Intel Core Ultra processors (or Intel at all. Lenovo, Asus, and Valve all opted for AMD chips). It's also packing a bigger battery than other handhelds, even if MSI isn't exactly claiming record-breaking battery life.\nMSi is claiming that it's producing a more ergonomic device, and while the plastic did divide some of our editors on the show floor, we're looking forward to trying it in long-term use. The screen seems similar to the one on the Asus ROG Ally, but considering that was a pretty decent screen, it's hard to argue with.\nIntel improving in graphics means we get more competition in handheld gaming outside of the Kickstarter space. We're looking forward to seeing how Intel and MSI put their own mark on it with MSI Center M, XeSS, and other technologies.\nRead more: MSI Claw is the first gaming handheld to run on an Intel Core Ultra processor with Arc Graphics\n\u2014 Andrew E. Freedman\nBest Cooling / DIY: Hyte Nexus Link\nIt\u2019s not easy to get excited about an ecosystem at a show like CES, but Hyte\u2019s Nexus Link was a standout for me.This cable-decluttering and system-building simplification platform is clearly a competitor to Corsair's iCue Link, with similar daisy-chained magnetic connectors and fans. But Hyte also offers magnetic RGB strips that use the same connector, and the products have a quirky but much more interesting design.\nNexus Link is powered by a quad-core Arm CPU housed in the screen built into the company\u2019s Thicc Q60 AIO cooler, which we first saw at Computex last year. It sports a thick 240mm radiator and chunky fans that the company claims will outperform any 360mm radiator currently on the market. So the importance of performance isn\u2019t getting left behind in the quest for clean design.\nIn my brief hands-on time with it, the whole Nexus Link ecosystem, from the hardware to the software, felt more refined, definitely more visually interesting, and arguably better built than what Corsair has done with iCue Link. That's a little shocking from a company so comparatively new and unknown.\nI will wait for the chance to build a Nexus Link system and spend some time with the software before I can say for sure how it compares to the competition from Corsair and Lian Li, and others. But on first impression, Hyte looks to be on the verge of pulling off a major upset in the DIY PC space.\nRead more: Hyte's Nexus Link ecosystem of RGB devices makes building rainbow PCs seem easier than ever\n\u2013Matt Safford\nBest PC Case: MSI MEG Maestro 700L PG\nWe saw quite a few PC cases designed to support motherboards with rear-facing connectors here at CES 2024, and MSI\u2019s Project Zero boards are some of the first to market using Maingear\u2019s patent. But most are fairly compact, and don\u2019t support full-size ATX options. MSI\u2019s large MEG Maestro 700L PG, though, supports up to E-ATX boards \u2013 like most of these cases, it will work with traditional motherboards as well). But the 700L PG takes the en vogue \u201cfishbowl\u201d case style to the next level, with the entire front and side panel made up of one massive curved piece of tempered glass.\nThe rest of the case is crafted from large panels of 2.5 mm-thick aluminum, and the dual-panel design hides the PSU behind the motherboard, along with all the wires and connectors. Don\u2019t worry about airflow, because fans or large radiators can be mounted in front of the motherboard, as well as on the top or bottom of the case.\nAs you might expect, this will be an expensive case, with an MSI rep telling us that it will cost around $400 when it arrives sometime in the next month or so. It\u2019s far from cheap, but if you crave that clean interior look with acres of glass to show off your GPU and other components, MSI\u2019s MEG Maestro 700L PG is arguably the prettiest of these kinds of cases we\u2019ve seen yet. But at the same time, just looking at that large bent piece of glass makes us more than a little nervous.\n\u2013Matt Safford\nBest Mouse: Mad Catz MMO 7+\nIt's been a while since we've seen Mad Catz \u2014 the company filed for bankruptcy in 2017 and then quietly revived under new ownership in 2018, but it hasn't exactly been making waves. But the brand is back at CES this year with a slew of gaming peripherals, including a new wireless version of an old classic: the MMO 7.\nThe new MMO 7+ is a wireless version of Mad Catz' classic MMO-focused multi-button mouse, with some improvements that bring it into 2024. It features a whopping 21 programmable buttons with a shift mode and five profiles for up to 210 inputs (okay, that's a little ambitious \u2014 but still, 21 buttons is pretty impressive). What's nice is that those 21 buttons are not just laid out in a 12-button side panel like most MMO mice have (see: Razer's Naga V2 Pro, Corsair's Scimitar Elite Wireless, etc), but are kind of... all over the mouse, which makes them easier to differentiate. Like the old MMO 7, it's modular and will come packaged with interchangeable palm rests and pinky rests, as well as a tool that will let you change the palm and thumb rest positions.\nAside from wireless connectivity (2.4GHz and Bluetooth) and a USB-C charging port, the MMO 7+ also features a Pixart PAW-3395 optical sensor, which has a maximum sensitivity of 26,000DPI, a maximum speed of 650 IPS, and up to 50 G's of acceleration, as well as customizable RGB lighting and a horizontal scroll wheel. The only real disappointment is battery life, which is currently rated at 40 hours \u2014 most gaming mice these days are hitting 75 - 120 hours, so that's a pretty big difference. Still, it's nice to see a mouse that's not just a stripped-down, ultra-lightweight, FPS-oriented pointer with the promise of unnecessarily high polling rates.\n\u2014 Sarah Jacobsson Purewal\nBest Keyboard: Cooler Master MK770\nWe've seen a lot of keyboards at CES 2024, and we actually saw this keyboard \u2014 or, well, the prototype of it \u2014 at CES 2023. But while we've seen a lot of gaming companies making keyboards to appeal to both gamers and keyboard enthusiasts, we haven't seen a lot of them also taking budget into account. Cooler Master's MK770 has all the premium features we've been looking for \u2014 gasket-mounted, hot-swappable, wireless with tri-mode connectivity, double-shot PBT keycaps, and more than one colorway \u2014 and it's set to cost just $119 when it launches this year.\nThe MK770 is also a 96-percent keyboard, meaning it's practically full-sized (minus some navigation keys) while still being relatively compact (or, well, as compact as you can get without sacrificing your number pad). It features a solid-feeling chassis with two sets of flip-out feet on the bottom \u2014 and cleverly-placed dongle storage under one of the flip-out feet, and has a programmable clickable volume knob. It's not the most feature-rich keyboard, but it's got everything you need for wireless gaming and it's hot-swappable.\n\u2014 Sarah Jacobsson Purewal\nBest Innovation: MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED\nBigger, faster, more colorful. Those are three aspects that we typically track when new monitors are announced. For example, ASRock is making waves with its new 27-inch 520Hz gaming monitor, and vibrant OLED monitors are becoming more commonplace. But what if a company could make a monitor smarter? That's not something we'd thought about until now, with the introduction of the MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED and its onboard AI acceleratoOne feature of the AI hardware, dubbed SkySight, can automatically pinpoint and mark enemies on the screen in games like League of Legends. Instantly knowing what direction your enemies are coming from \u00a0is a definite perk, even if you could do the tracking with your own eyes.\nAll the AI processing is performed onboard the monitor and is undetectable since there is no intervention from your operating system or other installed software. We could see this being frowned upon by competitive gamers as an unfair advantage, but the underlying technology that frames SkySight is intriguing.\nThe MEG 321URX even features what MSI calls a Spectrum Bar (basically, a thin RGB strip) that sits below the display. Once again, using League of Legends as an example, the Spectrum Bar can light up to mirror your character's current health status. Even though League of Legends was the primary focus of MSI's CES demos, the company plans to release software for training to detect on-screen items for just about any game. It would be cool to see the Spectrum Bar used to mimic shift lights that you would see on a steering wheel on an F1 driver's steering wheel in games like EA's F1 23.\nLooking past the AI intrigue, the MEG 321URX's specs sheet is impressive in its own right, with a 32-inch 4K QD-OLED panel. The monitor can even achieve 240Hz at that native resolution with a 0.03ms response time. It also features a USB-C port with 90-watt power delivery, HDMI 2.1, and DisplayPort 1.4 support.\nKeep an eye out for the MSI MEG 321URX QD-OLED when it debuts this spring.\nRead more: MSI's AI-powered gaming monitor helps you cheat at 'League of Legends,' looks great doing it\n--Brandon Hill\nBest 3D Printer: Creality K1C\nCreality\u2019s flagship K1 printer was already excellent, providing high-quality output at speeds as high as 600 mm/s. However, the K1 isn\u2019t perfect and there are a few things that Creality fans had wanted from it, including the ability to sustain higher temperatures and work with more exotic filaments.\nEnter the Creality K1C, which takes everything we like about the K1 and builds upon it. The new printer features an all-metal hotend which allows it to operate at a steady 300 degrees and therefore work with carbon fiber (that\u2019s what the C in K1C is for). The printer also has a revised bowden tube path, better build plate and other improvements we don\u2019t know about yet (the company has not released full specs). One of the leading 3D printer companies has a new leading device.\nRead more: Creality unveils new flagship K1C 3D printer and latest Ender 3 V3 model\n\u2013 Avram Piltch\nBest SSD: Phison PCIe 5.0 powered drives and controllers\nPhison previewed its E26 Max14um firmware prior to CES, and we saw multiple drives that should soon hit retail with performance of up to 14 GB/s. The key to enablement of the Micron 2400 MT/s NAND involved firmware updates and tuning to keep the controller within the PCIe M.2 power limit. Which brings us to the second part of this award.\nThe Phison E26 controller has been powering the fastest PCIe 5.0 drives of the past year, but the real innovation is set to arrive with the next generation E31 controller that will launch later this year. E26 is manufactured on TSMC's 12nm process, and the E31 will move to TSMC 7nm (N7). At that point, the combination of NAND and controller should effectively max out what we can expect to see from PCIe 5.0 drives \u2014 we'll need PCIe 6.0 to get significantly faster.\nPut another way, Phison is moving the entire high-performance consumer SSD market forward. Without Phison, we'd still be stuck with PCIe 4.0 drives for at least a few more months. We've had PCIe 5.0 M.2 slots on Z690 motherboards since 2021 and had to wait two years to get SSDs that would make use of the technology, and we have Phison to thank for that.\n\u2013 Jarred Walton\nBest Motherboard: ASRock Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning Wi-Fi\nASRock already owns most of the slots on our Best Motherboards page for current-gen chipsets, because the company has recently been delivering solid feature sets at comparatively low prices, while the rest of the industry seems content to churn out ever-more-expensive boards for the kinds of builders who still have $1,000 or more left over after buying the shiny new RTX 4080 Super.\nAnd the new Phantom Gaming B760I Lightning Wi-Fi, at just $200, looks to continue that trend for those looking to build a compact but powerful Mini-ITX with up to an Intel 14900K, thanks to 14+1+1 power phase setup, adorned with some chunky heatsinks.\nThe dual-DIMM setup that\u2019s typical of ITX boards should also make for top-speed RAM support. The only limiting factor here is that the board seems to only have a single PCIe 4.0 M.2 slot, although there could be another hiding on the back of the board. We hope to get this board in soon and run it through our benchmark suite. If it performs as expected, this will likely be an appealing motherboard for many gamers looking to build a powerful compact rig while spending most of their build budget on things like the GPU and CPU.\nRead More: ASRock's $200 Mini-ITX motherboard to support Intel Core i9-14900K\n\u2013 Matt Safford\nStay on the Cutting Edge\nJoin the experts who read Tom's Hardware for the inside track on enthusiast PC tech news \u2014 and have for over 25 years.

These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week.

You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

The program was ALL ON for CES 2024, receiving more than 3000 submissions, a record high and a 40% increase over CES 2023.\nEach year, an independent panel of industry expert judges, including members of the media, designers and engineers, reviews and rates submissions based on innovation, functionality, aesthetic, and design. Those rated the highest across all categories receive the Best of Innovation designation.\nFor the CES 2024 program, the top two categories by number of submissions were \u2018digital health\u2019 and \u2018sustainability, eco-design & smart energy.\u2019 This trend underscores the rapid pace of innovation in sectors that promise to solve big global challenges and improve human lives \u2013 a major theme at the show as CTA partners with the UN Trust Fund for Human Security and World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS) to advance human security. For the first time, the Best of Innovation list for CES 2024 includes a product from the \u2018Human Security\u2019 category, introduced at CES 2023.\nThe CES 2024 Innovation Awards also features a new category \u2013 artificial intelligence (AI). The AI category received 7% of all applications, underscoring that innovators are increasingly recognizing the transformative potential of AI in shaping the future of technology. AI will also be pervasive throughout the CES 2024 show floor and conference programming.\nThe full Best of Innovation list and all 522 Innovation Award honorees will be announced during CES 2024, where many of the products will appear in the Innovation Awards Showcase at CES, located in the Venetian Expo.\nThe Best of Innovation honorees for 2024 include:\nAirFarm\nCompany: Midbar Co., Ltd.\nProduct Category: Human Security for All\nAirJet\u00aeMini \u2013 Solid-State Active Cooling Chip for Electronic Devices\nCompany: Frore Systems\nProduct Category: Embedded Technologies\nAVEIR\u2122 Dual chamber (DR) Leadless Pacemaker System\nCompany: Abbott\nProduct Category: Digital Health\nBose QuietComfort Ultra Headphones\nCompany: Bose\nProduct Category: Headphones & Personal Audio\nFINTIN V1 : The Most Accessible Qwerty-Communicator\nCompany: ONECOM.CO.,LTD.\nProduct Category: Mobile Devices, Accessories & Apps\nGun Detection System\nCompany: Bosch\nProduct Category: Artificial Intelligence\nHestia\nCompany: VAONIS\nProduct Category: Digital Imaging/Photography\nHonda Motocompacto\nCompany: Honda\nProduct Category: Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility\nHP Spectre Fold\nCompany: HP Inc.\nProduct Category: Computer Hardware & Components\nIINK - 4D Food Printing System for Future Food\nCompany: Top Table Inc.\nProduct Category: Food & AgTech\nInteractive Transparent Window\nCompany: AUO Corporation\nProduct Category: In-Vehicle Entertainment\nITX181225\nCompany: I-TEN SA\nProduct Category: Sustainability, Eco-Design & Smart Energy\nJBL Authentics 500\nCompany: Harman International Corp\nProduct Category: Headphones & Personal Audio\nMand.ro Mark 7D\nCompany: Mand.ro Co.

This year's event not only showcased the latest advancements but also set the stage for what we can expect in the tech world in the years to come. From groundbreaking AI applications to futuristic mobility solutions, CES 2024 left no stone unturned in demonstrating the extraordinary capabilities of modern technology.\nRoaming the vast halls of CES 2024, it became evident that the overarching tech trends revolved around several key areas, underscoring the relentless evolution and integration of technology into every facet of our lives and industries.\nAdvancements In AI And Robotics\nArtificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning continued to dominate the spotlight at CES 2024. Innovations in generative AI, computer vision, and AI-powered robotics were nothing short of astonishing. Amazon, for instance, wowed the audience with new generative AI-powered Alexa experiences, enhancing our interactions with voice assistants.\nIntuition Robotics took a giant leap forward with their eldercare robot, ElliQ, which received a major upgrade. This sleeker and more agile version harnesses generative AI to engage elderly users in activities such as painting and composing poems, promoting cognitive and social wellness. ElliQ's transformation is a testament to how AI is improving the quality of life for vulnerable populations.\nLG unveiled a walking, talking smart home robot as part of their \"Zero Labor Home\" initiative. This remarkable creation boasts two-legged mobility, user recognition, and seamless integration with LG's smart appliances.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

The sheer number of new products revealed at this massive annual tech show is always overwhelming \u2014 and often filled with a lot of nonsense \u2014 which is why we\u2019ve done the work to surface the stuff you might actually want to buy this year.\nWe spent several days and countless hours scouring the show floor, meeting with top tech brands and getting our hands on dozens of new products across categories such as TVs, laptops, smart home and beauty. Throughout our search, we factored in our own testing history with each brand, how a product stacks up to the competition and, barring some exceptions, favored items that are actually coming to stores soon. Bonus points for anything that was truly innovative and not just a flashy gimmick.\nFrom stunning see-through televisions to immersive augmented reality glasses, here are our picks for the very best products of CES 2024.\nBest TV: LG Signature OLED T\nAt first, the LG Signature OLED T looked like just another excellent LG TV. But when the inky black background scrolled away, leaving just the bright fish swimming on a transparent pane, it was clear that the game had changed in 2024. We\u2019re curious to see what it\u2019s like in actual testing \u2014 we love OLED TVs for their rich contrast, which makes removing that black background a tricky play \u2014 but this set is the perfect TV to debut at CES. Tons of flash, an ambitious design and the offer of a new paradigm. Pricing and availability, of course, have yet to be revealed. \u2014 Henry T.

Its base rotates 360 degrees, its arm tilts 90 degrees up and down, and all that movement comes to life, thanks to Apple\u2019s DockKit technology. Pair your iPhone once and its cameras (including all apps in iOS) will follow and track your face, and it will even try to frame multiple people in the shot. It\u2019s reminiscent of Apple\u2019s slick CenterStage tech, and it\u2019s going to be so helpful for all kinds of things. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest keyboard: Hyte Keeb TKL Mechanical Keyboard\nWhile the Clicks iPhone keyboard entered CES with the most hype, Hyte\u2019s Keeb won my heart. Not only do its proprietary Fluffy Lavender key switches feel super smooth to type on but its mesmerizing lighting provides a truly trippy and intense RGB experience. On top of offering fully remappable keys, the dual rollers in the top left corner can be customized to your heart\u2019s delight. I love it so much that I\u2019m not even bothered that it won\u2019t be as customizable with Macs, as there\u2019s a physical button for switching between color schemes.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest AR/VR headset: Xreal Air 2 Ultra\nIt takes guts to go after the Apple Vision Pro for a fraction of the price, which is why I\u2019ve gotta hand it to the Xreal Air 2 Ultra. These $699 augmented reality glasses are being billed as a direct competitor to Apple\u2019s much-hyped headset, and based on my impressive, \u201cMinority Report\u201d-like demo, could serve as a nice alternative for folks who don\u2019t want to shell out $3,500 for immersive entertainment.\nThese futuristic glasses allowed me to flip through crisp-looking 3D movies, play around with digital objects and even control the smart home lighting in the room by simply tapping and pinching my way around a virtual space using natural hand gestures. You can also plug them into pretty much any phone, computer or even game console and enjoy a private 120-inch screen that you can take anywhere. I don\u2019t expect the Air 2 Ultra to offer the same visual fidelity as the upcoming $3,500 Vision Pro, and much of its appeal will come down to what apps become available at launch, but it\u2019s shaping up to be a promising alternative that won\u2019t run you the price of a high-end computer. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest laptop: Asus ZenBook Duo\nI didn\u2019t expect that you could fit a dual 3K OLED display setup in a backpack, but CES reveals always tend to deliver the best kinds of surprises. Meet the newest Asus ZenBook Duo, which hides its second super-high-res screen under its keyboard. You pop off that keyboard deck to truly expand your screen, to get a rig that rivals most home desktop operations. We\u2019ve seen dual-screen laptops for a while, but this design packs so many great tricks (including a kickstand mode) that we have the feeling it could be the model that makes these laptops a mainstream concern. We look forward to testing it more later this year.\u00a0\u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nBest gaming laptop: Alienware M16 R2\nI\u2019ve seen a metric ton of gaming laptops at CES 2024, but lots of them are simply last year\u2019s models with faster processors and better screens. However, the Alienware M16 R2 manages to stand out from the pack by improving on its predecessor in some meaningful ways.\nThis slick 16-inch laptop completely slashes the thick thermal shelf in the back \u2014 something I\u2019ve always found to be an unsightly quirk of an otherwise good laptop \u2014 resulting in an attractive and seamless design that\u2019s 15% smaller than before without making any big sacrifices to power or connectivity. I also enjoyed demoing the laptop\u2019s Stealth Mode, which lets you disable all that fancy RGB lighting and quiet down the fans with the tap of a button (perfect for when you\u2019re entering a coffee shop or just want to save some battery). These are useful changes that go beyond the usual performance bumps, and have me especially eager to spend more time with this machine. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming monitor: Alienware 32 4K QD-OLED\nAfter falling in love with our top ultrawide gaming monitor pick in the Alienware 34 Curved a few years back, it\u2019s perhaps no surprise that I had a great time with the company\u2019s new 4K option. This screen\u2019s combo of immersive OLED color and tournament-ready gaming performance made Halo Infinite a delight to play during some heated multiplayer action, and it looked even better than before, thanks to that sharper 4K resolution. And as much as I love an ultrawide, the new lineup\u2019s more conventional display sizes (including a more affordable 27-inch option) means that Alienware\u2019s great QD-OLED screens can now fit into a wider range of gaming setups. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest gaming hardware: Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar\nThe Razer Aether Monitor Light Bar is exactly what I look for in a CES gadget: It\u2019s unique, it solves a real problem and it\u2019s just plain fun. As its name implies, this $130 gadget sits atop your monitor to illuminate the front of your screen with your chosen blend of cool or warm light \u2014 something that can save you from eye strain if you game or stream for long hours in the dark.\nBut the real party is in the back, which is where you\u2019ll find a full Razer Chroma RGB strip that can bathe your wall in a rainbow of customizable, colorful lighting that looked really slick during our eyes-on time. It even supports Matter, one of our best of CES 2023 picks, meaning it\u2019ll play nice with your existing army of smart home gadgets for the ultimate glowy gaming setup. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nBest home product: GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nToo long have those lacking outdoor space been doomed to languish in a smokerless existence, but GE Profile, maker of the buzzy Opal Nugget Ice Maker 2.0, arrived at CES with a solution: the world\u2019s first and only indoor smoker, available for purchase as of last week. Certainly a splurge at $999, the Smart Indoor Smoker boasts Active Smoke Filtration technology, along with tight gaskets and seals, to ensure all the smoke stays inside the appliance \u2014\u00a0I can attest that CES\u2019 exhibition hall remained completely smoke-free.\nPlus, achieving the perfect level of smokiness is a cinch with features like preset and adjustable smoke settings; separate heat sources for cooking food and burning wood pellets (speaking of pellets, it uses a fraction of the amount of pellets required by a traditional smoker); and, yes, app connectivity. With a footprint small enough to fit on a countertop and a capacity large enough to fit a whole chicken, brisket, pork butt, three racks of ribs and up to 40 wings, regular enjoyment of home-smoked meals feels more attainable than ever \u2014 no nice weather required. \u00a0\u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nBest beauty product: L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro\nIf you took one look at the L\u2019Or\u00e9al AirLight Pro and thought \u201clight-up Dyson Supersonic,\u201d I wouldn\u2019t blame you. The Supersonic has been pretty much the only high-end, high-tech hair dryer of note since its launch in 2016, but this year at CES, L\u2019Or\u00e9al showed up ready to snatch the hair dryer throne with the announcement of its very splashy (and eerily familiar-looking) AirLight Pro \u2014 though the nozzleless design is where the similarities between the two dryers end. The AirLight Pro utilizes both high-speed wind and infrared light to dry water on the hair\u2019s surface without stripping strands of their internal moisture. According to L\u2019Or\u00e9al, the result is hair that\u2019s smooth, hydrated and dried fast while using 31% less energy than other leading premium hair dryers. But perhaps most exciting is the sheer customizability of the dryer (not to mention several attachments \u2014 two were shown at the event, but I was told that a total of five would be available when the product hits salons and bathroom counters later this year). It boasts settings specific to a range of hair types, all of which can be controlled on the dryer and via a corresponding mobile app.\nThough I wasn\u2019t able to try the dryer on wet hair, I was impressed to feel the differences in air pressure and heat as I toggled between them and found the app to be surprisingly useful. The AirLight Pro is rolling out to professional stylists in France later this year but is expected to be available to the US public by fall at a competitive price point of $499. Perhaps Dyson\u2019s days of hair dryer dominance are indeed numbered. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nOther CES 2024 products we liked\nWith so many standout products at CES 2024, not everything we liked was able to earn a top spot, but these came close. Here are some other highlights we\u2019re excited to test out more later this year.\nSamsung S95D\nOLED\u2019s Achilles' heel has always been how its panels can be a bit too glossy and reflective because of their brightness levels. This is why we\u2019re excited to test the Samsung S95D and its siblings to see how Samsung\u2019s trying to remove glare from its panels, which the company previewed at the show of shows. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nJBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone\nAs someone who makes videos and covers noisy conventions for a living, I may be a bit biased, but the JBL Quantum Stream Wireless Microphone seems like a content creator's dream. This plug-and-play mic makes capturing high-quality audio from your phone as simple as popping in a pair of AirPods \u2014 something I can vouch for, having used it on a busy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nAlienware Pro Series Keyboard\nI've always found Alienware's gaming keyboards to be a bit gaudy for my tastes, but its new Pro series model is a beautifully minimalist piece of hardware I'd love to have on my desk. It certainly doesn't hurt that its super-snappy switches felt great during some heated Halo action. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nTCL RayNeo X2 and X2 Lite\nThese discreet AR glasses stand out from the pack by offering a full-color navigation menu for snapping photos and bouncing between apps, something that felt fairly intuitive in my brief testing. This same tech \u2014 alongside hands-free photos and real-time translation features \u2014 will soon be coming to an even sleeker pair of frames in the RayNeo X2 Lite. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nLenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nIf you live in Windows and Android, as I\u2019m sure many of you do, Lenovo\u2019s excellent new 2-in-1 is a must-see. While it may look like a normal silver laptop at first, you can detach its screen to turn that panel into an Android tablet. \u2014 Henry T. Casey, electronics writer\nAsus ROG Zephyrus G14 and G16\nWe've always been fans of the ROG Zephyrus line, and this year's iteration gets major props for finally making the jump to immersive OLED while also looking sleeker and more attractive than ever. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nViewSonic XG272\nI've tested tons of gaming monitors, but I've never seen one that hides a handy remote right in its base like the ViewSonic XG272 does. Spending less time fiddling with onboard controls is nice; having a rich 27-inch OLED screen with all the requisite gaming bells and whistles is even better. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nMSI Claw\nSeemingly everyone is making a handheld gaming PC these days, but the MSI Claw stands out in a few key ways. It's one of the lightest high-end portables I've held so far, and it's the first to offer a full-on Intel Core processor \u2014 something that allowed it to pump out impressive performance and stay cool when I tried some Assassin's Creed Mirage on the go. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nEarFun Wave Pro\nEarFun has long made our favorite budget earbuds, which is why we're excited to see the company make the leap into over-ear headphones with the enticingly priced $80 Wave Pro. These cans include a slick carrying case, promise up to 80 hours of battery life and offer active noise cancellation, the latter of which worked surprisingly well on a noisy CES show floor. \u2014 Mike Andronico, senior tech writer\nKohler SpaViva Handshower\nI\u2019ve never sought more from my shower head than the ability to, well, spray water, but Kohler is operating on a different plane of bathroom comfort and efficiency. This hand shower doubles (actually, quadruples) as a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager, all of which can also detach from the handshower) \u2014\u00a0and it boasts a new microbubble setting for a supposedly deeper yet gentle cleanse that I\u2019m dying to try for myself. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nRoborock S8 Max V Ultra\nCorners have never been a robo vac\u2019s strength, but Roborock\u2019s new flagship model grew a FlexiArm to better reach those tight nooks and crannies in your home. This incredibly self-sufficient little guy also boasts the addition of a second mop head (it spins!), plus a dock that connects directly to your home\u2019s drainage system. Most intriguing of all, there\u2019s a camera on board that allows the vacuum to better recognize objects in its path \u2014 and allows you to stream the video to your smartphone, transforming the S8 Max V Ultra into a security camera on wheels (or just a babysitter for your pet). \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nMotion Pillow\nShaking your snoring partner is a thing of the past; this pillow will do it for you. The Motion Pillow detects snores, then locates your head and slowly inflates an airbag beneath it, causing you to gently turn to the side, which opens the airway and stops the snore. Sweet dreams indeed. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nPawport\nIt\u2019s not hard to improve on a piece of swinging plastic, but Pawport has truly changed the doggy-door game with an elegant steel-and-aluminum portal that fits over your existing pet door for a near instantaneous installation. Pawport opens up only when it detects the sensor affixed to your pup\u2019s collar, and with its companion app, you can lock and unlock, track usage, set Fido\u2019s curfew and monitor the backyard wanderings of multiple pets. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nAnker Solix F3800 Portable Power Station\nLater, generator. Anker\u2019s moving on up from powering your phone to quietly powering your home up to a whopping 12,000W with the Solix F3800, a backup system that leaves fuel out of the equation. You can even use the Anker app to set charging to occur only when sunlight is strong or electricity rates are low for maximum energy savings. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nGovee AI Sync Box Kit 2\nGovee\u2019s LED strip lights are some of our favorites, but at CES, we were impressed by the brand\u2019s new game lighting that uses \u2014 you guessed it \u2014 AI to recognize in-game events like victories and damage and respond with some dazzling custom lighting effects. \u2014 Chelsea Stone, editorial director\nNote: The prices above reflect the retailers' listed price at the time of publication.\nReceive product recommendations, reviews and deals three times a week.\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy\n\u00a9 2024 Cable News Network.

These brands and products were chosen based on usefulness, function, innovation and overall cool factor.\nWe narrowed down the winners in a number of categories from laptops to robot vacuums and smart home devices to 4K TVs. We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too. Although you do have to plug it into a wall, its components are run through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box, which feeds inputs to the TV wirelessly and encases all of the cables and wires for a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing for the LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV, while it\u2019s expected to be available for retail at the end of 2024.\nLG Soundbar S95TR\nAn impressive TV needs to be paired with an impressive soundbar. The LG Soundbar S95TR is a 9.1.5-channel sound system that comes with 65-inch soundbar with three up-firing speakers, rear speakers and a subwoofer for your TV, while the system is Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision and DTS:X compatible for immersive and detailed audio. It also connects wirelessly to just about any LG 4K TVs via WOWcast.\nBelkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nIf you\u2019re alone, but needed a portable solution to dynamic Zoom video calls or just making a TikTok video, the Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit is a very cool and useful way to make self-tracking videos with your Apple iPhone.It\u2019s MagSafe and NFC (Near Field Communication), so all you have to do is attach your iPhone and Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro will track and follow your body and face. During our time with the product, it appeared to move smoothly and effortlessly with 360-degree rotation and 90-degree tilt. wMeanwhile, it has up to five hours of use per charge and works in-app with TikTok, Zoom, Instagram and more.Belkin has it priced at $179.99, while the tech company has yet to announce availability.\nMaster & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones\nMaster & Dynamic partnered with a neuroscience company called Neurable to deliver a pair of wireless headphones that can your track work sessions and measure your stress levels through your brain waves through a mobile app. They can even recommend when you should take a break when you\u2019re deep into your work.Aside from their focus capabilities, Master & Dynamic MW75-Neuro Headphones offer premium audio quality with active noise cancellation and up to 32 hours of battery life per charge. The headphones are available for pre-order for $649 with delivery in early 2024.\nJBL Live 3 Earbuds\nNot only do the JBL Live 3 Earbuds feature world-class audio that crisp, clear and rich with active noise-cancellation, they offer something that most premium wireless earbuds do not \u2014\u00a0a charging case with a 1.45-inch LED touchscreen display. Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power. It\u2019s Bluetooth-enabled for smartphones and laptops, while it even has a radio and CD player for old school music appeal.\nGarmin Epix Pro\nThe Garmin Epix Pro is the tech company\u2019s second generation of its fitness and adventure smartwatch line.

It\u2019s design to standup to even the harshest of elements, whether you\u2019re hiking, trial running or mountain climbing. The Garmin Epix Pro is available now and starts at $799.99.\nMSI Claw A1M Handheld Gaming Console\nWith the popularity of the Steam Deck and Asus ROG Alley, PC gaming handhelds have been all of the rage with more and more companies getting into the mix. Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels. It has a 1000R curvature, 7680 x 2160 4K resolution with up to 120Hz for smooth motion and action when gaming, while it has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits.

The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is perfect for larger rooms and homes.Roborock has it priced starting at $1,800 with an expected release date sometime in spring 2024.\nXgimi Horizon Max Projector\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is an IMAX Enhanced-certified projector, which means it fits the criteria for the resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio from IMAX at home. This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. It has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode, so you can have different settings for different walls in your home. So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action. The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Here\u2019s how it works.\n6 trends to watch for at CES 2024: AI everywhere, Meteor Lake laptops, smart appliances, metaverse, and more\nA really big show\nThe future is just around the corner -- and you'll be able to catch a peek of it in early January. Every year, the technology industry gathers in Las Vegas for CES, an annual tech industry expo where the year ahead in products is previewed, tested, and talked about. It\u2019s like catnip for the technology world.\nTraditionally, CES highlights include flat-screen TVs, soundbars, and other consumer electronics, and for the curious, TechRadar has a great round-up of what to expect from CES 2024. I don\u2019t foresee much revolution in those traditional spaces landing at this year\u2019s show. But that doesn\u2019t mean innovation has slowed; here\u2019s my take on the biggest trends that will shape the show, and the products and innovations I\u2019m expecting to see \u2013 as well as those I\u2019d like to see more of.\nAnd since CES is also the launchpad for more hype than a rap record, I\u2019ve highlighted a few areas where the hot air will be hottest.\n1. AI everywhere \u2013 especially on your laptop\nArtificial Intelligence has been driving consumer electronics for ages now. Half a decade ago, I spoke with LG Electronics President and CTO I.P. Park, who told me AI could simplify complicated systems and help people get more out of their gear. \u201cWhen you\u2019re driving a modern luxury car most people are probably using only five percent of the entire feature set of the car,\u201d he told me. \u201cBecause it\u2019s too complex \u2026 what AI will hopefully do is solve the problem of using complex systems so that the devices become smart. And smart devices will know exactly what you want,\u201d Park added. Everything LG makes would include it, he said.\nSo how much progress has been made in the last five years? Not all that much, I\u2019d argue. Until last year, that is, a watershed period that debuted generative AI (for better or worse), chatbots, and Microsoft\u2019s announcement that it would bake AI into a revolutionary new version of Windows expected for sometime next summer. They\u2019ll probably call it something horrible like Windows 1124H2, but think about it as Windows 12. And at CES 2024, AI PCs built for it will be all over the place.\nOn Dec. 14, Intel unveiled Meteor Lake, its newest chipset, which includes for the first time a dedicated AI processor component, called an NPU or Neural Processing Unit. AMD beat them to the punch, announcing at last year\u2019s CES the Ryzen 7040 notebook processors, which incorporate \u201cAMD XDNA AI\u201d \u2013 again, dedicated AI support. And at CES this year, we expect most major laptop manufacturers will unveil their AI PC lineups. Watch for huge, splashy reveals from Lenovo, HP, Dell, Acer, Asus, MSI and more.\n2. Appliances get Serious AI\nBut what about Park\u2019s comments? Is your vacuum today AI-powered? Does your iron know just how much steam is too much? If AI is in all things, surrounding us like the Midi-chlorians that let Luke use The Force, why aren\u2019t our appliances better? Yes, today's washers and dryers use AI to sense humidity levels and adjust accordingly. But is this AI? Does this require intelligence or merely better sensors? And no standard-size oven can, for example, detect whether your Thanksgiving turkey is perfectly moist.\nWill CES 2024 change that? Doubtful, at least for traditional, full-size devices. Although fascinating advances continue: I\u2019m particularly impressed by Whirlpool, which will be showcasing a range of new appliances with SlimTech insulation, a proprietary material that can replace the bulky polyurethane foam in the walls of your current fridge. SlimTech can reduce the wall thickness by up to 66 percent -- allowing for up to 25 percent more capacity. Amazing! In 2023 LG showed off MoodUp, a color-changing fridge meant to one-up Samsung\u2019s beautiful Bespoke French door refrigerators. What will this year bring?\nApparently, AI\u2019s secret power is broiling a better T-bone.\nTo see the biggest changes, narrow your gaze: Look to the smaller, smarter countertop devices that have proliferated in recent years from June, Brava, and Anova. Those devices have limited AI built-in, nothing to rival the advances seen over the last year, but a ton more than traditional kitchen gear. And then there\u2019s Seer Grills, which recently launched Perfecta, billed as \u201cThe World\u2019s First AI-Powered Grill.\u201d Apparently, AI\u2019s secret power is broiling a better T-bone. And we\u2019ve seen remarkable new devices from GE\u2019s Profile division, which recently unveiled a countertop nugget ice maker. Will the new year bring anything new? We\u2019re looking at you, GE\u2026\nAnd one space in particular is thriving: robot vacuum cleaners. With household names like Eureka and Roomba competing against lesser-known names like Narwal and Ecovacs, it\u2019s going to be a messy fight. (See what I did there?) And there\u2019s plenty of innovation: At IFA 2023 in Berlin, Switchbot launched a vacuum that connects directly to your water pipes, letting it wash itself clean before going back to work for you. And since Matter unveiled support for robovacs in 1.2 of its sorta useful spec, they should hopefully work more seamlessly with all of your other digital gear. Maybe Matter will matter?\n3. Smarthome: Here comes the smart grid\nSpeaking of the smarthome, the industry is evolving.\nWhole-home chargers and solar power cells have become an enormous focus for the consumer electronics industry, as the power industry \u2013 at last \u2013 gets smarter. It\u2019s a logical advancement from companies that make batteries and chargers, starting with powerhouse names like Anker, which unveiled the Solix brand in June and will likely reveal more in the lineup at CES. Think of Solix and its ilk as giant battery packs for your house. Its largest capacity 180kWh array can apparently keep the lights on in a typical house for a whole week, which could come in handy if your local grid is impacted by extreme weather.\nLook for news from Jackery as well, which was named to TIME\u2019s Best Inventions of 2023 for its Solar Mars Bot \u2013 how cool is that? And there are dozens of companies looking at the home battery space, from big names like Schneider Electric and Bluetti to newcomers like Exeger and Ugreen and Goal Zero (and its $4,000 YetiPRO portable power station) and more.\nIt\u2019s also a place for new brand names to flourish like flowers under a solar-powered grow lamp (which you can also find at CES). And innovation in general: Samsung recently added the first ever EV charger to its SmartThings platform, letting users better manage and monitor the charge in their electric vehicle, as well as a partnership with Eve Energy to let you keep tabs on how much juice everything in your home is sipping.\nOne interesting twist on the standard battery comes from Palo Alto, California, start-up Coplanar, which sells portable hydrogen power generators and whole-home energy products. It\u2019s a renewable clean energy source using a chemical reaction rather than combustion, producing only water and heat as byproducts. Hydrogen power\u2026what could go wrong?\n4. Cars go electric, not autonomous\nWhile the worlds of tech and automotive seem to be racing at each other faster than Vin Diesel and his pals, the market for self-driving cars has already burst like a punctured tire. GM\u2019s Cruise self-driving car company lost $1.4 billion in 2022 alone, and Ford took a drubbing, writing off $2.7B in 2022 and noting in its earnings report that it would shift focus from the Level 4 autonomous systems being developed by Argo AI to driver-assistance tech such as adaptive cruise control and lane-switching assistance.\nThe market for self-driving cars has burst like a punctured tire.\nThis means there will be tons of real-world tech on display at CES 2024, actual stuff you can actually buy today for your next actual car. Will Chrysler and Tesla continue to lead the driver-assist world? Only time will tell.\nOf course, EVs will be all over the show, and rightly so. 2020 saw around 3 million in global EV sales; by 2023, that had rocketed to 10.25 million, and the number is predicted to hit the 17 million mark in five years. Electric vehicles are moving towards the software-defined vehicle (SDV) category, which means much of the vehicle's functionality (and even its powertrain) can be tweaked and updated via over-the-air updates (OTA). Ford recently discussed its plans for SDV features. Look for other makers to detail similar plans at CES.\nMeanwhile, tech companies continue chomping at the bit to get into cars. Chinese companies like Xiaomi and Huawei are jumping headfirst into this space, and we expect to hear from numerous other electric car startups, including Lucid, Polestar, Fisker, and Faraday Future. Okay, maybe NOT Faraday Future.\n5. Health-tech for women rules the world\nThe intersection of health and tech is a key space for CES, which explains the explosion in panels, keynotes, and conversations at the show on the topic. Among those speaking at CES are Linda Anegawa, Noom\u2019s Chief of Medicine; Jesse Ehrenfeld, President of the American Medical Association; Stephen Hoge, President of Moderna; and Gail K. Boudreaux, president and CEO of Elevance Health.\nThey reflect all aspects of the wide world of health, from award-winning pacemaker innovations from healthcare giant Abbott to smart beds, health monitors, fitness gadgets, digital doctors, and more. But one space stands head and shoulders above the rest: women's health.\nSometimes called femtech, innovations to help monitor, maintain, and improve women's health have been the source of many fascinating innovations lately. For just one example, consider the Evie smart ring from Movano Health, which debuted at CES 2023 and uses AI to connect the dots between menstrual cycles and sleep habits, among other things. In August the company filed for FDA clearance as a medical device; it finally ships in January, the company says.\nAnd expect day-to-day innovations in beauty tech, where smart mirrors and makeup aides are robotic wonders. L\u2019Oreal has an enormous history of innovation here: Last year it unveiled a computerized makeup applicator and the first at-home electronic eyebrow applicator. In 2017 it was a smart hair brush that we called \u201cthe combing coach you never knew you wanted.\u201d What will 2024 bring?\nThere's tech for all genders, of course. Withings has made a name for itself in the smart health space: The company invented the connected blood pressure monitor in 2011. And it continues to innovate on health gadgets: We have it on good authority that the company plans a multipurpose handheld device that looks intriguing for 2024. And we were impressed by NuraLogix at CES last year, which fairly accurately measures your blood pressure simply by taking a 30-second video. We\u2019re hoping this tech becomes a functional product in 2024.\nIf you\u2019re walking the show floor, look for an array of smart beds and massage chairs that always manage to give me a jolt of fresh energy. (Why don\u2019t I have one of these at home yet?)\n6. Hypewatch: VR/AR/MR, 6G and more\nIs it silly? Maybe! Is it over-hyped? Absolutely! Dare we call it just plain vanilla preposterous? You bet we do! But there are nonetheless advancements and work being done in augmented reality that might lead to an augmented future \u2013 with or without Mark\u2019s Meta.\nSoundscape makes a musical metaverse based on Unreal Engine 5, supporting avatars for an interactive VR music festival, for example. The company recently announced partnerships with GRiZ, Slash, Evanescence, Goose, and more, and promises additional partnerships with prominent labels before and after the launch at CES 2024. Heck, I\u2019d like to see a virtual concert. And VR for healthcare is absolutely a positive use of this technology. From immersive virtual reality and augmented reality for PTSD treatments to haptic feedback that can help restore lost senses, there\u2019s some reality amid the muck.\nAR is also just fun, with VR for cars, AR for astronauts, and MR for everything in between. But will it touch your life any time soon? We really, really doubt it.\nMeanwhile, watch out for big companies to slip the term 6G into presentations and displays. We know what you\u2019re thinking \u2026 and we\u2019re right with you.\nYou might also like\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nAfter 25 years covering the technology industry, Jeremy Kaplan is a familiar face in the media world.

We are expecting the Korean company to go hard on introducing new TVs and smart home appliances (like this new robot vacuum and mop) \u2014 all of which will most probably come with a ton of AI smarts built-in.\nAnd on the other side, there is Samsung Galaxy Unpacked, where we will be seeing the new Galaxy S24 line of smartphones from the company. You won\u2019t be the least surprised to know these will be packed with AI features too. This event will be happening just a few days after CES on Wednesday, January 17.\nLG\nLG normally follows suit with Samsung in introducing new TVs and smart home tech to form a unified suite across the house. But LG Display also appears at CES to drop some interesting concepts, and make some rather bold future predictions.\nSo far, two announcements have been made \u2014 the first of which is a beefy 98-inch QNED TV with AI enhancing every part of your viewing experience. This includes a Personalized Picture Wizard to take all the settings tweaking-based guessing games out of finding a picture that you like, and AI Sound Pro that has the rather ambitious goal of delivering 9.1.2 virtual surround sound from built-in speakers.\nAnd the second is a future concept of what a car interior could look like with the help of LG\u2019s various OLED display innovations. We\u2019re not just talking about a big tablet on the dashboard a la Tesla, but rather a full length OLED panel in the front with Switchable Privacy Mode (so the passenger can watch something without distracting the driver), and slidable screens for backseat passengers.\nTVs\nLooking more broadly at what looks set to happen to the TV at CES 2024, you start to notice that AI is a key running theme throughout. But personally, I\u2019m anticipating three other common trends to run throughout:\nLaptops\nSo far, the biggest news surrounding laptops has been the launch of Intel\u2019s new Meteor Lake and AMD\u2019s \u201cHawk Line\u201d CPUs \u2014 both of which are (yep, you guessed it) packed with advanced AI features.\nWe\u2019ve seen some new laptops jump on the early embargo, such as the Acer Swift Go 14 and MSI Prestige 16. But as we look forward to the many new announcements set to come from the likes of Asus, Dell and more, it\u2019s now time to ask one simple question: how will laptop hardware change with the times?\nAnd no, I\u2019m not talking about some huge change to form factor (though I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to see some more dual-screen/foldable concepts). I mean what small but impactful hardware tweaks will laptop makers give you a more direct line to using the ever growing suite of AI capabilities?\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nInstant access to the hottest deals available plus daily breaking news, reviews, helpful tips and more from the Tom's Guide team.\nJason brings a decade of tech and gaming journalism experience to his role as a Managing Editor of Computing at Tom's Guide.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "6 Major Trends To Expect From CES 2024\nGet ready for AI in everything.\nHere we go again: CES (aka the Consumer Electronics Show) officially kicks off tomorrow, running from January 9\u201312. The world\u2019s largest consumer electronics show returns to Las Vegas to set the technology trends for the year.\nLast year, BMW trotted out its mesmerizing color-changing i Vision Dee electric car, we got a glimpse at wireless TVs, and we checked out the weird world of AR smart glasses and VR headsets for your face.\nWe expect to see more of that, but there\u2019s one tech buzzword you can count on hearing a lot: AI. You can bet on artificial intelligence being everywhere \u2014 even in devices where it might make little sense. But such is the nature of CES. It\u2019s a place to see the future before everyone inevitably lives it.\nInverse will be covering all the CES announcements that are worth reading about. Be sure to bookmark our CES 2024 hub page to stay informed. Now, let\u2019s get to what the crystal ball is showing.\n6. AI In Everything\nLG\u2019s new Signature OLED M4 and G4 TVs have built-in AI that can automatically adjust picture settings based on the context of what\u2019s happening within movies and TV shows.\nFor better or worse, artificial intelligence \u2014 in its many forms through machine learning, or generative via large language models (LLMs) \u2014 is going to be in virtually every new gadget. TVs, laptops, phones, tablets, cars, gaming systems, smart home devices and home appliances \u2014 you name it, and somebody will be explaining how AI will supposedly transform them into new must-buys.\nIt\u2019s nothing new \u2014 tech giants like Samsung and LG have been shoehorning AI into their devices for years (to tepid reception) \u2014 but with the renewed interest in AI thanks to ChatGPT and LLMs, it seems like anything and everything with a sprinkle of \u201cintelligence\u201d is back on the table.\n5. Laptops with Copilot Button\nDell\u2019s XPS 13, 14, and 16 laptops have the new Copilot AI button (to the right of the second Alt key).\nAhead of CES, Microsoft announced new Windows 11 PCs will come with a Copilot button for bringing up the AI chatbot that\u2019s now baked into its operating system. As Inverse Senior Editor James Pero explained, the addition of the Copilot button to PC keyboards is a big deal \u2014 proof that Microsoft is all in on AI and chatbots playing a significant role on desktops and laptops.\nPC makers like Dell (XPS 13, 14, and 16) and Acer (Swift Go 14 and 16) have already announced laptops with the new Copilot button. If you\u2019re in the market for a new Windows laptop, get familiar.\n4. Tons of Handheld Gaming PCs\nThe Steam Deck created the whole \u201chandheld\u201d gaming PC category.\nValve\u2019s Steam Deck validated handheld gaming PCs as a product category in 2022. Last year, we saw the start of some real competitors in the Asus ROG Ally, Lenovo Legion Go, and the myriad Ayaneo models. Now that handheld gaming PCs are a full-blown category, we\u2019re expecting other PC brands to get in the game. The MSI Claw recently leaked and from the looks of it, the device will have specs that could blow away Asus\u2019 ROG Ally.\nThere\u2019s no doubt CES 2024 will be crawling with handheld gaming PCs from brands big and small. Will Razer bring out a proper handheld PC instead of the half-baked Razer Edge 5G that landed with a thud a year ago?\n3. Generative AI Cozies Up to Smart Homes\nLarge language models could reboot voice assistants like Alexa with more intelligence.\nWe thought last year\u2019s CES would revitalize interest in the smart home and voice assistants. Aside from more devices with Matter built-in, the smart home announcements were pretty mild, with more of the same old.\nHowever, with AI, specifically ChatGPT and large language models, smart home devices might get an actual injection of intelligence. LLMs have the potential to support voice assistants with way more data and knowledge than was previously possible with pre-programmed databases. At the very least, we should get a glimpse of how the smart home will become smarter.\n2. More EVs and more E-Bikes\nWe\u2019ve said it before, and we\u2019re saying it again: CES is kind of a car show, specifically one with a sizable EV presence. At last year\u2019s show, Sony had Afeela, BMW had the i Vision Dee, Ram had its 1500 Revolution concept truck, Vinfast announced it\u2019s making e-bikes, and we got a preview of Hyundai\u2019s crab-walking parking tech, to name a few highlights.\nNow that the EV revolution is well on its way, we\u2019re not expecting many groundbreaking technologies but more iterative innovations. Think EV batteries that charge faster and get longer range. And, of course, there will surely be a flashy concept or two, and EVs with larger dashboard and passenger displays, more immersive spatial speaker systems, and dazzling interior lighting.\nThings could be more interesting with e-bikes. Electric bicycles are transforming cities worldwide. Whether it\u2019s a simple motor that converts a regular bike into an electric one, a high-tech \u201csmart\u201d e-bike such as a VanMoof, or cargo e-bikes like a Cake or UBCO, there should be many to see in Las Vegas. Mostly, we\u2019re hoping to see more affordable e-bikes across the whole spectrum, which would be a win for all consumers.\n1. Here Come the Apple Vision Pro Competitors\nXreal\u2019s Air 2 Ultra smart glasses is touted as a \u201cspatial computer\u201d without the bulk of the Apple Vision Pro or Quest 3.\nApple Vision Pro will be one of, if not the biggest, product launch of the year. As is the case with every new Apple product, there\u2019s always a ripple effect. CES will no doubt be filled with headsets and smart glasses of all varieties this year. There will be headsets that look similar to Vision Pro, but only do a few things, like give you a giant virtual display. Many of them will probably run on Qualcomm\u2019s new XR2+ Gen 2 chipset.\nWhether they have high-res displays and performance like Vision Pro or cater more to VR or AR like Meta\u2019s Quest 3 or Xreal\u2019s Air 2 Ultra smart glasses, mixed reality headsets and video glasses are likely to become mainstream this year as tech companies look to offer something at different price points.\nINVERSE brings you everything from the fun and futuristic world of consumer technology at CES 2024.
