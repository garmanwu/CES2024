It fosters excitement and innovation in the industry, giving the sharpest minds their moment to shine in the spotlight.\nCES 2024 has come and gone, and we saw the biggest trends for monitors in 2023 taking a stronghold. From display technologies like OLED to 4K displays and portable setups, the balance between form and function was duly explored.\nLG came through with its Signature OLED T, which has a transparent display, and Asus became the talk of the show with ROG Swift OLED, an absolute beast with a native refresh rate of 240 Hz. Another strong contender is the display put on by Mobile Pixels, with models that serve every possible cause.\nHere\u2019s a look into the best CES monitors.\nMP 49E95 QD-OLED Curved Gaming Monitor\nMobile Pixels 49E95 will blow your mind. This nifty tech essential is a 49-inch beast that provides you with a lot of real estate to do as you please\u2014think of the multitasking possibilities!\nIt has QD-OLED panels, completely changing the game with accurate color and definitive contrast. With its R1800 curvature, it will bring the action much closer.\nAnd when you consider the response time of 0.03ms, \u2265178\u00b0(H)/\u2265178(V)\u00b0 viewing angles, a brightness of 250 nits (HDR off) / 450 nits (HDR on, APL 10%), and a refresh rate of 240 Hz, it\u2019s a truly exciting monitor that will surely perform well for everything from gaming to streaming.\nGeminos Dual Stacked Monitor\nThis stacked monitor with two 24-inch screens is a worthy addition to anyone\u2019s tech stack because it instantly multiplies screen real estate. Each monitor has 1920 x 1080 resolution, providing crisp, clear image quality, a 60 Hz refresh rate for smooth gameplay, and adjustable brightness up to 250 nits. It also has touchscreen capabilities on the bottom display (Geminos T), which gives it 5/5 stars in our book.\nIt is designed with an advanced front-facing Full HD camera, microphone, and a pair of built-in 3W speakers, which keeps your desk clutter-free. And, thanks to its linkage system, you can easily adjust its height and angle for the best ergonomics.\nDuex Float Portable Stacked Monitor\nDuex Float is a brainchild of Mobile Pixels that provides excellent value for money with its futuristic features. The 15.6-inch 1080p display is 10-point multi-touch touchscreen-enabled with a refresh rate of 60 Hz and adjustable brightness of up to 250 nits. It is in a stacked orientation, which can reduce neck strain.\nIt weighs just 4 lbs, has two USB-C ports with pass-through charging, which allows a device to send power to other devices, and has 7W total energy consumption. This is undoubtedly a portable powerhouse, perfect for multitasking professionals.\nIt features a kickstand and supports three different modes, so it\u2019s guaranteed to keep you productive and efficient without sacrificing ergonomics.\nLG UltraGear OLED (32GS95UE)\nLG unveiled the World\u2019s First VESA Certified Dual Mode Gaming Monitor, and it\u2019s every tech geek\u2019s dream come true. This tech titan is a dual-mode OLED, which means it can switch from 4K 240 Hz to Full HD 480 Hz.\nLG has also come through with tiny bezels, 0.03ms (GtG) response time, and an incredible sound system that puts you in the center of the game. With exceptional color and contrast and no motion blur, it\u2019s sure to deliver an unparalleled experience.\nAcer Predator Z57\nAcer\u2019s Predator MiniLED Z57 is a beast. We\u2019ll start with its defining feature: a 57\u201d curved MiniLED display\u2014imagine the field of view on this one! With up to 120 Hz refresh rate and 2304 Local Dimming Zones, it improves color contrast by leaps and bounds, creating a spellbinding wraparound visual experience.\nThis incredibly immersive, cinematic masterpiece uses AMD FreeSync Premium\u2122 technology for a flicker-free gaming experience. It delivers up to 1000 nits of brightness and acoustic resonance. You can also tweak the setup to your preference with adaptable ergonomics.\nYou can get it in the second quarter of 2024 for a sweet price of $2,499.99.\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G8\nSamsung\u2019s 34\u201d Odyssey OLED G8 has a sleek, curved display with 3,440 x 1,440 resolution and 250 cd/m2 brightness. It gets a leg up with Neo Quantum Processor, the company\u2019s proprietary technology that sharpens contrast and fine-tunes brightness.\nSo, if you\u2019re in a career with graphic-intensive requirements, you should bring this bad boy home. It\u2019s equally great for gamers, thanks to its 0.03ms (GTG) response time and 175 Hz refresh rate, expanding the vision field for a competitive edge.\nIt retails for $2,299, and we recommend it to anyone who relies on exceptional clarity and smooth motion to make grown people money.\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G6\nSamsung\u2019s Odyssey G6 is a top-tier gaming monitor available in two sizes: 27 and 32 inches. It is prized for its QHD resolution with DisplayHDR600, typical brightness of 350 cd/m2, and 1ms GTG response time. It provides spectacular depth and detail, so it\u2019s an excellent choice for gamers and professionals who render graphics.\nThe cherry on the cake is that it has AMD FreeSync Premium Pro. It can synchronize the display\u2019s 240 Hz refresh rate with the frame rate of compatible graphic cards. This reduces screen tearing to deliver an unparalleled high-performance gaming experience.\nAsus ROG Swift PG27\nThe Asus ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDM is a favorite with tech enthusiasts, as it is fantastic for most use cases. Its unbeatable specs display deep, inky blacks without blooming, with a heat management system that makes it virtually burn-in resistant. You can expect a smooth viewing experience with NVIDIA G-SYNC.\nSo, if you\u2019re into tear-free gaming, you know where to shop!\nMobile Pixels Trio\nMobile Pixels TRIO are power-packed 1080p full HD displays that were an absolute hit on Kickstarter, and it\u2019s easy to see why.\nThese screen extenders\u2014which come in two size options (13.3 and 14.1 inches)\u2014instantly multiply available screen space. There\u2019s zero compromise on functionality, as it has a 60 Hz refresh rate, adjustable brightness of up to 250 nits, and an aspect ratio of 16:9.\nThese monitors have a second-stage sliding mechanism that supports four modes. So, whether you\u2019re a gamer who wants to chat with their followers while streaming or a student who wants to read and compare texts simultaneously, these monitors have you covered.\nMSI MPG 491CQP QD-OLED\nMicro-Star International\u2019s MPG 491CQP QD-OLED was a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree for a reason. It features a Dual Quad High Definition (DQHD) resolution in a curved next-gen QD-OLED panel. That\u2019s 7,372,800 pixels per frame to deliver the most vivid, detail-rich viewing experience ever.\nThis monitor also has a 144Hz refresh rate and a rapid 0.03ms (GtG) response time, promising exceptionally smooth and responsive gameplay and reduced motion blur, effectively putting you ahead of the competition.\nPlus, it is equipped with Graphene film for silent and efficient heat dissipation.\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor has raised the standard with 4K resolution in OLED. It deserves a standing ovation for crisp, precise details in high color purity to feast on.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe 5 best monitors at CES 2024\nThe most exciting displays at the show feature some truly incredible screen specs\nIf you\u2019re a big ol\u2019 display dweeb like myself, CES 2024 is basically Christmas\u2026 just replace the big-boned, beardy dude trespassing on your premises with the best monitors and best TVs being debuted in Las Vegas in front of hordes of excited tech press.\nThe annual Sin City-based mega event has produced some particularly exciting monitors this year, a number of which boast truly ludicrous refresh rates that should have hardcore first-person shooter fans drooling. What\u2019s also becoming increasingly clear is the PC market\u2019s continued love affair with OLED technology is getting more intimate with every passing year.\nWith so many impressive new models being produced from a variety of manufacturers, the days of the traditional IPS panel look increasingly numbered if you demand impeccable black levels from your monitor.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nThe best monitors of CES 2024 so far\nIf you\u2019re in the market for a new monitor, you may want to hold out for another few months until the tantalizing displays below have been released. Some of them look simply sensational. Here are some of the best monitors we\u2019ve seen from CES so far. Buckle up screen nerds: your peepers are in for quite the ride.\n1. Acer Predator Z57\nEven as someone who owns a 49-inch gaming monitor, this thing is just silly. Yet silly in the best possible way. The Acer Predator Z57 is a colossal 57-inch, 120Hz ultrawide gaming monitor that essentially has the same screen real estate of a couple of 4K displays. It\u2019s resolution? A frankly absurd 7,680 x 2,160. Let that number sink in for a second.\nThe Z57 further impresses with 1000R curvature, which should make for quite the wraparound viewing experience in some of the best PC games. Throw in the fact it\u2019s capable of hitting 1000 nits of brightness in HDR mode and hits 98% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, and this titan should produce beautifully accurate, utterly vibrant pictures. Just make sure you go out and purchase a desk the size of a park bench if you\u2019re planning on buying this beast.\n2. Asus ROG Swift PG27 (2024)\nThe Asus ROG Swift PG27 has always been an excellent monitor series, but this year the company is really taking things to the next level with more than a little help from Nvidia. Alongside a number of other monitors from Dell and Philips, the latest PG27 boasts the latest evolution of Team Green's G-Sync technology.\nCalled G-Sync Pulsar, Nvidia describes it as \u201cthe next evolution of Variable Refresh Rate (VRR) technology\u201d. Said fps-smoothing tech promises to deliver not only the usual stutter-free gaming experiences you\u2019d expect from the best G-Sync monitors, but the company claims it will set \u201ca new gold standard for visual clarity and fidelity through the invention of variable frequency strobing\u201d. Nvidia promises the latest ROG Swift PG27 will boast effective motion clarity to over 1000Hz. So if you\u2019re looking for a gaming monitor capable of producing potentially the smoothest gameplay experiences we\u2019ve ever seen, this currently looks like the model to beat.\n3. Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 (2024)\nBoy, does my timing ever suck when it comes to buying new monitors. I caved and picked up the awesome Samsung Odyssey OLED G9 in an admittedly delicious Black Friday deal late last year, but now I have serious display envy thanks to the announcement of the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8. Last year\u2019s model was already a terrific gaming monitor with a screen resolution of 3,440 x 1,440 and a gorgeous OLED panel that sported a 175Hz refresh rate.\nSamsungs\u2019 latest model (full title the Samsung Odyssey OLED G8 G80SD), is a different beast entirely. For one thing, this 32-inch OLED gaming monitor ditches the previous G8\u2019s ultrawide aspect ratio in favor of a more traditional 16:9 form factor. That\u2019s instantly going to make it more accessible to those with limited desk space.\nThe most exciting stat is that the new G8 rocks an astoundingly speedy 240Hz refresh rate. Pair that with its 4K display (3,840 x 2,160) and response times of just 0.03ms, and this should be one hell of a gaming screen if you\u2019ve got a powerful enough GPU/CPU combo to squeeze the most out of its stunning specs.\n4. Alienware AW3225QF\nDespite the fact the amazing Alienware AW3423DWF is currently boxed up in my bedroom ready to be sold on eBay \u2014 mainly because I bought that Samsung G9 I mentioned above \u2014 I really do love Alienware monitors. I\u2019ve owned several down the years, and from a specs perspective, the Alienware AW3225QF looks to be the most impressive gaming monitor Dell has manufactured to date.\nThe headline, oh so exciting facts for display nerds? This is a 32-inch, 4K OLED monitor that has a refresh rate of 240Hz. Predictably being OLED, response times are currently quoted at just 0.03ms. Color accuracy should also be excellent, with the AW3225QF covering 99% of the DCI-P3 gamut. This panel's PPI (pixels per inch) is also higher than any existing OLED gaming monitor at 140 PPI \u2014 most existing OLED monitors max out at just over 100 PPI. My only slight concern with this is could be overly pronounced pixel density on a 32-inch screen.\nBut hey, that\u2019s ultra nerdy nitpicking on my part. This baby looks like the real deal, and we could easily see it sitting atop our picks of the best gaming monitors later in the year. It launches later this month for what I'd argue is a pretty reasonable $1,199.\n5. LG\u2019s new 480Hz monitor\nIf you\u2019re in full \u201cMaverick Mode\u201d and are craving the need for ALL the speed, LG\u2019s currently unnamed new 27-inch OLED display could be the gaming monitors of your dreams. While it may not have an official moniker yet, we know that this 1440p (or QHD) display features a refresh rate of \u2014 wait for it \u2014 480Hz. If you\u2019re an aspiring future eSports champ, you may have just found the monitor to power your aspiring competitive gaming fantasies.\nThis new LG monitor\u2019s screen credentials are further boosted by LG Display's \u201cMETA technology\u201d, last seen in the sensational LG G3 OLED TV. Essentially, it\u2019s a type of software solution that in the case of the G3, combined with that television\u2019s Micro Lens Array panel to create one of the brightest and best OLED TVs we\u2019ve ever reviewed. When this monitor finally gets a name, expect its HDR performance to be almost impressive as that head-spinning refresh rate.\nCheck out our CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: all the GPUs, monitors, and laptops to expect\nCES remains a big show in the world of computing. We still live in an era when all the biggest names in PCs show up to the event trying to outdo each other, which always makes it exciting as onlookers.\nFrom the looks of it so far, CES 2024 looks to be a big one. A slew of new PC hardware, laptops, gaming laptops, monitors, and much more are bound to be announced. Here\u2019s what to expect from the show and what we know so far.\nNvidia, AMD, and Intel\nJanuary 8, 2024.8AM PT.\n\ud83d\udcfa: https://t.co/OQiFvriGdw pic.twitter.com/UZ0uNjknDE\n&mdash; NVIDIA GeForce (@NVIDIAGeForce) January 4, 2024\nNvidia plans to have a big presence at the show this year. Its virtual presentation starts at 8 a.m. PT on Monday morning, the media day before CES officially kicks off. What the company will be talking about this year is no secret. The RTX 40 Super desktop GPUs have been fully leaked now for months, followed by official teasers from the company. At this point, the new cards feel like the closest thing we have to a guarantee.\nSo yes, the RTX 4080 Super, 4070 Ti Super, and 4070 Super are rumored to all get launched, along with a lot of talk around AI, of course. Notably, there don\u2019t appear to be any mobile GPUs being announced this year, so don\u2019t expect the RTX 50 series\u00a0to get kicked off just yet.\nAMD\u2019s keynote is happening just before Nvidia at 7 a.m. PT in a presentation titled \u201cTogether we advance AI.\u201d AMD CEO Dr. Lisa Su will be hosting, along with the general manager of computing and graphics, Jack Huynh. You can expect the general topic of AI to be a focus, though leaks around the impressive performance of new Ryzen 8000 APUs look promising, too.\nEither way, don\u2019t expect an entire line of new GPUs to combat Nvidia\u2019s announcements, though there are rumors that AMD will bring a more budget-friendly desktop GPU, the Radeon RX 7600 XT. The rumored card would use the Navi 32 GPU and fill the gap between the RX 7700 XT and RX 7600.\nLastly, Intel\u2019s presentation will be at 3 p.m. PT on Monday afternoon. Having already announced its Meteor Lake processors in December, this year\u2019s CES keynote may be focused on the broader topics of AI. CES Pat Gelsinger will be hosting, where \u201cIntel technologies, supported by innovative and open software, enable AI capabilities for consumers and businesses to create a better, responsible, more sustainable, and more inclusive future for all.\u201d\nRumors also point to a 14th-gen Raptor Lake Refresh to sit alongside Meteor Lake, having been mentioned in leaks recently. How Intel will position these chips will be fascinating, especially due to how much effort it put behind the Core Ultra rebrand.\nLaptops\nThe timing with laptop refreshes this year has been a bit awkward. They are usually aligned with announcements from Nvidia, AMD, and Intel, but with Nvidia out of the question, most of the attention is around Intel\u2019s Meteor Lake \u201cCore Ultra\u201d rollout. The major announcements around the launch have already been made in December, along with a host of new laptops to support, such as the Acer Swift Go. But we can expect another slate of laptops from the usual suspects to get announced.\nDell already announced its shake-up to the XPS line this week, introducing the new XPS 13, 14, and 16, as well as some new UltraSharp monitors. If you believe the leaks, there\u2019s much more on the Alienware front, too. Expect laptop manufacturers like HP, Lenovo, Asus, Razer, and many more to have new devices to share. Because there are no mobile GPU announcements expected, however, gaming laptops will largely be based on last year\u2019s GPUs, such as the RTX 40-series.\nRegardless, you can pretty much guarantee that nearly every single new laptop will be marketed as an AI PC, even if that concept feels increasingly like a misnomer.\nMonitors\nGaming monitors have become quite a buzzy topic at CES over the last few years, especially as the race to adopt more advanced panel technology has sped up. Companies like Samsung Display and LG are usually in attendance with new panels, partnered with all the manufacturers, whether that\u2019s Samsung Electronics, Asus, or Dell. Some of the biggest announcements have already been made, such as LG\u2019s dual-refresh rate 480Hz OLED monitor.\nIt\u2019s safe to assume that OLED will be the name of the game, but seeing how these companies can push the technology even further is always of interest. Look at Acer\u2019s 27-inch 3D monitor, which was announced last fall and provides a glasses-free 3D experience. Hopefully, we\u2019ll see more monitor technology like this that takes the technology in new directions and further improves things we\u2019re used to, like resolution, refresh rate, and backlighting.\nXR headsets, peripherals, desktops, and much more\nWith Apple\u2019s Vision Pro waiting in the wings with a rumored launch in February, don\u2019t be surprised if we see some of the competition ramping up, too. Mixed-reality headsets and corresponding VR technology are always a fun part of CES, especially the more experimental releases. Now that Apple has used the term expect the topic of spatial computing to be the talk of the town.\nBeyond that, you can expect your usual assortment of new mice, keyboards, desktop PCs, PC components, and other accessories to flood the Las Vegas Convention Center halls, hoping to stand out enough to make a splash. Which will? For that, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\nExternal GPUs are great, but are limited by the bandwidth of Thunderbolt. At CES 2024, Lenovo has announced a proprietary port and external GPU with a full PCIe connection to get more out of your desktop GPU.\nIt's TGX, or the ThinkBook Graphics Extension, and it is capable of transferring up to 64Gbps data throughput. This is similar to what Asus achieved with its ROG XG Mobile interface, which is supported by various ROG gaming notebooks as well as the ROG Ally handheld.\nThe Alienware 34 QD-OLED took the world by storm. As the first really great OLED gaming monitor, it had little in the way of competition.\nBut in 2024, that's not true. And to keep its lead, Alienware has launched two new QD-OLED gaming monitors that take things even further. There is now a 32-inch 4K model (AW3225QF) and a 27-inch QHD model (AW2725DF), both of which use the second-generation QD-OLED tech from Samsung Display. I got to see both models in person at a preview event ahead of CES 2024, and I came away extremely excited for these new gaming monitors.\nThe Alienware m16 is only on its second generation, but the company is already hitting the reset button on the design. The m16 R2, announced at CES 2024, has both a redesigned chassis and reengineered thermals, plus one very notable feature never seen in an Alienware gaming laptop.\nMost Alienware laptops have proudly featured a \"thermal shelf\" on the back, which purportedly helped with air ventilation and positioned the ports out of the way. The problem with the thermal shelf is the extra size it adds to the footprint of the laptop. It also adds a rather large bottom chin and hinge under the screen -- and sometimes results in a small palm rest and touchpad.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace. In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too.

Although it might seem gimmicky, the case actually provides notifications and music controls. It can even take phone calls when paired with a smartphone.However, if you\u2019re an iPhone user, you won\u2019t get the same features and quality as high-end Android users who have a Google Pixel 7, Google Pixel 8 Pro, Samsung Galaxy S23 and others.JBL has these earbuds priced at $199.95 with an expected release during summer 2024.\nPanasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270)\nIf you live in a small and cozy home, then the Panasonic Shelf Speaker System (SC-PM270) will work wonders on delivering high-end sound quality inside of a sleek and stylish design \u2014\u00a0thanks to 10cm full-range audio drivers, an internal amp and dual speakers that offer 20 watts of stereo power.

Enter the MSI Claw A1M, a PC handheld that runs Windows 11 Home with MSI\u2019s gaming skin layered on top. It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable.

It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels. It has a 1000R curvature, 7680 x 2160 4K resolution with up to 120Hz for smooth motion and action when gaming, while it has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits.

The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is perfect for larger rooms and homes.Roborock has it priced starting at $1,800 with an expected release date sometime in spring 2024.\nXgimi Horizon Max Projector\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is an IMAX Enhanced-certified projector, which means it fits the criteria for the resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio from IMAX at home. This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality.

So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action. The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

When it comes to the most interesting models this year, there were two noteworthy themes.\nFirst of all, my complaint in 2022 about there not being enough OLED monitors was largely addressed this year. CES revealed many plans for OLED monitors in 2024, with a good number of those screens set to be appropriately sized for desktops. That includes the introduction of 32-inch, non-curved QD-OLED options and other smaller screens for people who have been waiting for OLED monitors in more varied form factors.\nSecondly, with more people blending their work and home lives these days, CES brought hints that the line between gaming monitors and premium monitors used for general or even professional purposes will be blurring more in the future. We're not at the point where the best productivity monitor and ideal gaming monitor perfectly align in a single product. But this week's announcements have me imagining ways that future monitors\u00a0could better serve users with serious work and play interests.\nFor now, here are the most intriguing monitors from CES 2024.\nDell UltraSharps hit 120 Hz\nDell UltraSharp monitors have long attracted workers and creatives and, with their USB-C connectivity, even Mac users. The last few CES shows have shown Dell attempting to improve its lineup, with the most landmark innovation being the introduction of IPS Black. With CES 2024, though, Dell focused on improved video resolution.\nDell's UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW), pictured above, is a 39.7-inch ultrawide with a 5120\u00d72160 resolution and a 120 Hz refresh rate. As most monitors are aimed at workers still using 60 Hz, this is a big step up for people with systems capable of supporting 11,059,200 pixels at 120 frames per second. Such speeds have been relegated to gaming monitors for a while, but with TVs moving to higher refresh rates (with encouragement from gaming consoles), more people are becoming accustomed to faster screens. And with other attributes, like a 2500R curve, we wouldn't blame workers for doing some light gaming on the U4025QW, too.\nBut Dell says the refresh rate boost is about increasing eye comfort. The UltraSharp U4025QW is one of two monitors with 5-star certification from T\u00dcV Rheinland's new Eye Comfort program, which Dell helped create, a Dell spokesperson told me last month at a press event.\nAccording to T\u00dcV, the certification program \"is no longer limited to the old low-blue-light or flicker-free labels\" and now \"covers a broader range of safety indicators, such as ambient brightness, color temperature adjustment and regulation, and brightness.\u201d New requirements include brightness and color temperature control for different ambient lighting. Dell's ultrawide covers this with an integrated ambient light sensor.\nThe certification also requires a minimum 120 Hz refresh rate, which is probably where Dell got the number from. A Dell spokesperson confirmed to Ars that the use of IPS Black didn't impact the monitor's ability to get T\u00dcV certifications and that it could have theoretically earned five stars with another panel type, like VA.\nDell announced bringing 120 Hz to the UltraSharp lineup in November when it debuted two 24-inch and two 27-inch UltraSharp monitors with 120 Hz refresh rates. At CES, Dell proved this upgrade wasn't a fluke relegated to its smaller UltraSharps and went all in, bringing the refresh rate to a top-line ultrawide 5K Thunderbolt 4 monitor.\nThe U4025QW has an updated version of ComfortView Plus, which uses hardware to lower blue light levels. I've seen it function without making colors turn yellowish, as some other blue-light-fighting techniques do. After not significantly updating ComfortView Plus since its 2020 release, Dell now says it's using a \"more advanced LED backlight\" to reduce blue light exposure from 50 percent to under 35 percent.\nThe effects are minimal, though. Dell-provided numbers claim the reduced blue light exposure could reduce eye fatigue by 8 percent after 50 minutes, but we should take that with a grain of salt. It's nearly impossible to quantify how well blue light reduction techniques work from person to person.\nThe UltraSharp U4025QW releases on February 27, starting at $2,400.\nChannel Ars Technica\nRelated Stories\nToday on Ars\nNewsletter Signup\nJoin the Ars Orbital Transmission mailing list to get weekly updates delivered to your inbox.

As the name implies, this is a monitor that you can instantly switch from 2D to 3D, allowing you to have a solid gaming display when you need it or an immersive 3D monitor when you want it. It\u2019s a 17.3-inch OLED display that folds into a 12.5-inch package, and with a weight of only 2.4 pounds, it\u2019s easy to carry with you wherever you go.\n Bolstered with a new chipset, a comfortable design, and software designed to tackle the issues with Windows on a handheld, this might be the portable gaming PC to buy this year.\n It plays both the high-resolution, cinematic side of gaming and the super-fast competitive side, allowing you to have the best experience for the game you\u2019re playing.\n",

        "raw_content": "The best monitors we saw at CES 2024\nIt was all about monitors at CES 2024, and we had a chance to see a lot of them. Samsung has exciting new gaming displays, Asus is pushing refresh rates to places they\u2019ve never gone, and Acer is experimenting with some exciting glasses-free 3D tech. And that\u2019s just the products I could fit in a three-item list.\nYes, we saw some exciting monitors at CES this year. Here are the best monitors we had a chance to lay our eyes on.\nLG dual refresh rate OLED\nIt really didn\u2019t take long for refresh rates to shoot up on OLED monitors. Just last year, we saw the first crop of 240Hz OLED displays, and we already have a 480Hz OLED from LG this year. It\u2019s not 480Hz across the board, but LG is able to provide such a high refresh rate with its interesting dual refresh rate feature.\nBasically, the monitor is a 32-inch, 4K OLED display with a 240Hz refresh rate in its base form. However, LG lets you toggle over to a 1080p resolution at 480Hz with a single button. It plays both the high-resolution, cinematic side of gaming and the super-fast competitive side, allowing you to have the best experience for the game you\u2019re playing.\nI suspect something like this has been possible for a while \u2014 lower resolution should mean you can achieve a higher refresh rate. LG is just making it a reality. Last year, we were singing the praises of the first 500Hz displays, regardless of how mediocre the image quality was. Now, you can get that same speed on an OLED panel, and that\u2019s something to get excited about.\nSamsung Odyssey OLED G8\nSamsung is finally being boring, and I couldn\u2019t be more excited. Instead of insane curves and crazy aspect ratios, the 2024 Odyssey OLED G8 is a flat, 32-inch gaming monitor with a 16:9 aspect ratio. It earns its stripes with a second-gen QD-OLED panel, however, and the introduction of 4K to the world of OLED gaming monitors.\nOn top of that, it sports a brand-new design that manages to look even better than last year\u2019s model. It has the same slim silver frame, but the CoreSync bias lighting on the back is now brighter, and the stand is slightly smaller. The look elevates a gaming space, and that\u2019s more than I can say for most other gaming monitors.\nThe specs are definitely here, too. You\u2019re getting a 4K panel with a 240Hz refresh rate and, as usual, the stunning contrast of OLED. We\u2019ll have to get this display under the microscope once it\u2019s available, but it looks like an easy pick for the best gaming monitor of 2024 if it holds up. This is just the start, too. Other monitors are packing these same panels, including the new Alienware 27 QD-OLED and 32 QD-OLED.\nDell UltraSharp 120Hz displays\nGaming monitors have received all the love over the past few years, but Dell is changing that. Its new UltraSharp productivity displays are getting a big upgrade with a 120Hz refresh rate, finally bringing the smooth, premium feel of a gaming monitor to the desktop.\nThe UltraSharp 34 and UltraSharp 40 are curved 21:9 monitors, both of which use an IPS Black panel. The key feature here is the refresh rate, of course, but they come with a slew of other premium features, as well. Those include an integrated Thunderbolt hub and a built-in KVM switch.\nThe displays are pricey, with the 34-inch model coming in over $1,000, but it\u2019s still nice to see some premium options in the world of productivity monitors. For too long, productivity displays have been stuck with the same bog-standard IPS panels and 60Hz refresh rates, and these two new Dell displays are changing that.\nAsus 480Hz OLED monitor\nThis one definitely came out of left field. Asus has a 1440p OLED monitor with a native 480Hz refresh rate. No, that\u2019s not a typo. 1440p. OLED. 480Hz. I would do the cliche of asking what more you could want, but the specs really speak for themself here.\nI\u2019m shocked. LG Display and Samsung Display make the lion\u2019s share of panels for gaming monitors, so we normally know what to expect from brands like Asus at CES. Not this year. It seems Asus is the only one pushing this high of a refresh rate on an OLED monitor at 1440p, truly putting it in a class of its own.\nEven more impressive is that Asus is claiming this display can hit a peak brightness of 1,300 nits, which would certainly make it the most impressive OLED we\u2019ve ever seen. This is one we\u2019ll need to test thoroughly once it\u2019s available, but the specs alone are enough to get me excited.\nSamsung 2D/3D gaming monitor\nI\u2019ve never been on the train of glasses-free 3D monitors. They just haven\u2019t worked that well, but Samsung is changing that. The 2D/3D gaming monitor, as you might guess from the name, is more of a tech showcase than an actual monitor you can buy. But it\u2019s a tease of what Samsung is cooking up, and we\u2019ll hopefully hear more about it later this year.\nAs the name implies, this is a monitor that you can instantly switch from 2D to 3D, allowing you to have a solid gaming display when you need it or an immersive 3D monitor when you want it. It works with two cameras that track your eyes and head, providing a 3D view in any game you can throw at it. What surprised me most was that the tracking actually worked, getting around the dreaded sweet spot issue we\u2019ve seen with previous glasses-free 3D displays.\nIn addition to standard games, the monitor supports VR games and content so that you can play them without a headset. We need to see more from this monitor, but for early impressions, it was definitely among the most impressive displays I saw at CES this year.\nPredator SpatialLabs View 27\nSpeaking of glasses-free 3D, Acer has been chipping away at the tech for years with Spatial Labs. We saw this tech for the first time last year at CES, but only in laptops. Now, Acer is applying it to a 4K gaming monitor, fit with a 27-inch size and a resolution of 160Hz.\nAcer\u2019s implementation is better than Samsung\u2019s, mainly because only a select list of games is supported through Spatial Labs. The list is fairly large at 50 titles and growing, and you can still use the monitor for standard 2D titles.\nAcer may not have support for any game, or support for VR titles, but the experience is much better, and it\u2019s a real monitor that you\u2019ll be able to buy. Acer says the display will be available in the first half of this year for $2,000. Pricey, but that\u2019s the cost of cutting-edge gaming tech.\nAsus ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH\nWhat\u2019s better than an OLED monitor? A portable OLED monitor that you can fold and put into a backpack, obviously. That\u2019s what Asus is offering with its ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH. It\u2019s a 17.3-inch OLED display that folds into a 12.5-inch package, and with a weight of only 2.4 pounds, it\u2019s easy to carry with you wherever you go.\nFoldable screens still aren\u2019t perfect, but this is the best application of foldable OLED we\u2019ve seen so far. A kickstand is built into the display, allowing you to configure it for either a horizontal or vertical orientation. It\u2019s quite a hefty stand, but if you\u2019re looking for a more secure mount, Asus also includes a tripod mounting hole.\nWe don\u2019t have a ton of details on the display yet, namely its price or availability. Asus tells me it will likely be on the more expensive end, but that\u2019s expected for an OLED display you can throw in your bag.\nHP Omen Transcend 32\nHP has released plenty of gaming monitors under its Omen brand, but it\u2019s certainly not the first company you think of when it comes to premium gaming displays. That\u2019s changing with the HP Omen Transcend 32. It\u2019s a QD-OLED monitor that measures 32 inches, and it\u2019s capable of a 4K resolution at up to 240Hz.\nWe\u2019ve seen a handful of similar monitors this year at CES, but this one is shocking because it comes from HP. It definitely wins some style points, too. The white shell looks wonderful, especially contrasted against a square of RGB lights around the back of the monitor.\nElsewhere, the monitor supports 140 watts of power delivery over USB-C, which is a first in this class of gaming monitor. This is HP\u2019s first QD-OLED gaming monitor, so we\u2019ll have to test it properly before making a judgment. It\u2019s certainly a stunner from our early preview, though.\nI\u2019m sorry to say it, but I'd be lying if I said otherwise. NPUs are useless. Maybe that comes off as harsh, but it doesn\u2019t come from a place of cynicism. After testing them myself, I'm genuinely convinced that there\u2019s not a compelling use for NPUs right now.\nWhen you go to buy your next laptop, there\u2019s a good chance it will have a Neural Processing Unit (NPU) inside of it, and AMD and Intel have been making a big fuss about how these NPUs will drive the future of the AI PC. I don\u2019t doubt that we\u2019ll get there eventually, but in terms of a modern use case, an NPU really isn\u2019t as effective as you might think.\nI'm worried about Nvidia's upcoming RTX 4080 Super, but probably not for the reason you think. Nvidia revealed the long-rumored GPU at CES 2024, and perhaps the most shocking news around the announcement was that Nvidia was going to drop the price. Instead of releasing at the same $1,200 list price as the original RTX 4080, the RTX 4080 Super is launching at $1,000.\nIt's a great price, and a positive step for Nvidia, which has largely been seen as the driving force behind high GPU prices over the past year. I'm worried the price might be too good, though.\nMSI is entering the handheld arena, and its debut is more significant than you might think. The MSI Claw doesn't look dissimilar from the Asus ROG Ally or even the Steam Deck OLED, but the specs underneath mark a significant departure for handheld gaming PCs.\nI had a chance to try the device at CES 2024, and it's definitely a contender. Bolstered with a new chipset, a comfortable design, and software designed to tackle the issues with Windows on a handheld, this might be the portable gaming PC to buy this year.\nUpgrade your lifestyleDigital Trends helps readers keep tabs on the fast-paced world of tech with all the latest news, fun product reviews, insightful editorials, and one-of-a-kind sneak peeks."

        "raw_content": "When you purchase through links in our articles, we may earn a small commission. This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nTop 10 monitors of CES 2024\nCES 2024 was a glorious show for monitors that reinforced the best trends of 2023. A new generation of OLED panels from Samsung and LG hit the show floor, and with them come higher resolutions, higher refresh rates, and improved peak brightness in HDR.\nBut the show wasn\u2019t entirely dominated by big, expensive OLED gaming monitors. Acer brought a 57-inch super-ultrawide Mini-LED and MSI had a practical 24-inch 4K office monitor with USB-C Power Delivery.\nThese are the best monitors of CES 2024.\nFurther reading: The best laptops at CES 2024\nSamsung Odyssey G8 OLED (G80SD)\nMatt Smith / Foundry\nThe Samsung Odyssey G80SD is easily the most important monitor at the show, though not necessarily because of the monitor itself. The spotlight instead shines on Samsung\u2019s 4K 240Hz QD-OLED panel. It\u2019s a sharp, stunning, high-contrast display with beautiful color and excellent motion clarity, and it will appear in several other monitors in this list.\nWith that said, there\u2019s plenty to like besides the panel. Samsung\u2019s Odyssey monitors have veered towards a practical and professional look in recent years, and that\u2019s a plus. The G80SD looks superb and includes a great ergonomic stand that provides a wide range of adjustment but doesn\u2019t take up too much space on your desk. The monitor also has two HDMI 2.1 ports, one DisplayPort, and a USB hub (though no USB-C).\nAvailability and pricing has not been announced. Given the price of other monitors with this panel, however, I expect it to fall between $1,000 and $1,300.\nSamsung Odyssey G6 OLED (G60SD)\nMatt Smith / Foundry\nIf the Odyssey G8 OLED is all about image quality, the Odyssey G6 OLED is all about motion clarity. It retains the 27-inch panel size and 1440p resolution common to OLED monitors in 2023, but kicks the refresh rate up to 360Hz.\nAnd, yea, it looks super-crisp. OLED panels have a baked-in motion clarity advantage over other panel types thanks to their low pixel response times. Put simply, the pixels on an OLED monitor change more quickly, which in turn reduces motion blur at any given refresh rate. It\u2019s not the best available from an OLED (that honor goes to another monitor on this list), but it\u2019s excellent.\nPricing and availability hasn\u2019t been announced, but I expect a price around $1,000 or less.\nAsus ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDP\nMatt Smith / Foundry\nThe Asus ROG Swift OLED PG27AQDP is a 27-inch 1440p OLED monitor with a frankly shocking 480Hz refresh rate. It\u2019s not alone in this accomplishment (LG, which makes the OLED panel, also has an as-yet-unnamed 480Hz monitor), but the Asus\u2019 variant has a more alluring design.\nA 480Hz refresh rate is double the 240Hz common to last year\u2019s OLED monitors, and wow, it looks incredible. I can\u2019t say with absolute certainty that it defeats 500Hz monitors like the Alienware AW2525HF, since I haven\u2019t viewed them side-by-side, but I\u2019m pretty sure it does. Moving objects look nearly perfect. Fine text remains readable and textures retain even the smallest details.\nThe display also benefits from LG\u2019s Micro Lens Array (MLA) technology, which boosts the peak brightness to 1,300 nits. I\u2019d have to test the monitor first-hand to decide how much of an impact it makes, but I expect HDR movies and games to deliver eye-searing brightness more often.\nUnfortunately, you\u2019ll have to wait awhile for this display. Asus says it won\u2019t ship until the second half of 2024.\nMSI Modern MD242UPW\nMatt Smith / Foundry\nOkay, let\u2019s get practical. The MSI Modern MD242UPW isn\u2019t a monitor you\u2019ll hear much buzz about, but I respect a good, well-rounded work monitor. The MD242UPW is exactly that.\nResolution is the monitor\u2019s standout specification. 4K is common, but 24-inch monitors with this resolution are few. That\u2019s frustrating for people who want a small, yet sharp, secondary monitor. The MD242UP fills this gap.\nIt\u2019s also packed with useful features including a USB-C port that delivers up to 100 watts of power delivery, a KVM switch, and built-in speakers. These features reinforce the MD242UPW\u2019s position as a great choice for productivity, and it should pair especially well with laptops that have USB-C.\nPricing and availability has yet to be announced.\nMSI MEG 321URX\nMatt Smith / Foundry\nNow, for something completely different: MSI\u2019s borderline absurd MEG 321URX. This is a 32-inch 4K 240Hz OLED monitor that uses Samsung\u2019s QD-OLED panel, so it\u2019s a stunner. The image is sharp, vivid, and smooth.\nWhat sets the MEG 321URX apart, though, is its unusual set of AI features. This includes a lighting element on the chin of the monitor that is designed to detect your health bar in PC games and alter the lighting of the bar to match the health you have left. It also has a feature called Skysight, which can be used to highlight enemies just off-screen in games like League of Legends. The monitor also touts an \u201cAI upgrade\u201d feature, which gamers might put to use for AI features in their favorite games (the details of how this works were thin, however).\nThe MEG 321URX will retail for $1,799 when it arrives in June or July of 2024.\nAsus ROG Swift OLED PG39WCDM\nMatt Smith / Foundry\nDo you think a 34-inch ultrawide is too small, but a 45-inch or 49-inch ultrawide is too large? Asus has you covered with the ROG Swift OLED PG39WCDM. It\u2019s a 39-inch curved OLED monitor with a resolution of 3440\u00d71440 and a 240Hz refresh rate. This is another new panel from LG and, as a result, it uses Micro Lens Array (MLA) technology to achieve a peak brightness of up to 1,300 nits in HDR.\nAlthough clearly great for gaming, Asus includes a number of practical features. It has a USB-C port with DisplayPort Alternate Mode and up to 90 watts of USB Power Delivery, a KVM switch, and picture-in-picture/picture-by-picture modes. Asus also demonstrated the monitor with a ROG monitor arm, though I\u2019m told it\u2019s sold separately.\nThe Asus ROG Swift OLED PG39WCDM is expected to ship in the first quarter of 2024, but the price is not yet announced.\nAcer Predator Z57\nMatt Smith / Foundry\nAcer\u2019s Predator Z57 was among the few new Mini-LED monitors at CES 2024, but it\u2019s large enough to count for two (or three). It has a gigantic 57-inch panel with a resolution of 7680\u00d72160 and a 120Hz refresh rate. It\u2019s basically two 4K monitors stuck side-by-side. Personally, I\u2019d love to use it to practice my piloting skills in Microsoft Flight Simulator.\nThe Mini-LED backlight includes a total of 2,304 dimming zones. That\u2019s much higher than most Mini-LED monitors available (512 or 1,024 zones is more common), though they admittedly have more real estate to cover. Still, the backlight should provide excellent brightness in HDR games, and the monitor is VESA DisplayHDR 1000 certified.\nExpect to pay $2,499.99 for the Predator Z57 when it arrives in the second quarter of 2024.\nGigabyte Aorus FO32U2P\nThe Gigabyte Aorus FO32U2P is another gorgeous new 32-inch 4K 240Hz monitor with a Samsung QD-OLED panel. It provides all the usual benefits including perfect black levels, vivid color, and a sharp image that retains its clarity at high refresh rates.\nGigabyte\u2019s claim to fame, however, is bandwidth. It\u2019s the world\u2019s first DisplayPort 2.1 monitor and can achieve up to 80Gbps of bandwidth without the use of Display Stream Compression (DSC). The monitor also supports daisy-chain connections, which means it\u2019s possible to connect additional DisplayPort monitors to the Aorus FO32U2P. That makes the added bandwidth more relevant.\nPricing and availability hasn\u2019t been announced.\nViewsonic XG272-2K-OLED\nMatt Smith / Foundry\nThe XGX272-2K-OLED is Viewsonic\u2019s take on the 27-inch, 1440p, 360Hz QD-OLED panel also found in the Samsung Odyssey G6 OLED. It performs just as well here. Expect to see near-perfect black levels, vivid color, and excellent motion clarity.\nViewsonic sets itself apart with a few extra features. It officially supports both AMD FreeSync and Nvidia G-Sync (Samsung only lists FreeSync, though I expect it should work with both). The monitor is \u201cBlur Busters Verified\u201d and supports Black Frame Insertion, a technique that can further reduce motion blur.\nIt\u2019s also a debut monitor for a new design language that emulates the modern, white-on-black aesthetic of recent Alienware monitors. Is it derivative? Perhaps a bit, but it also looks great. And, as a final bonus, it comes bundled with a remote that controls the monitor\u2019s on-screen menu options.\nThe XG272-2K-OLED will ship in the first quarter of 2024 for $899.99.\nHP Omen Transcend 32\nMatt Smith / Foundry\nThe Omen Transcend 32 is yet another monitor using Samsung\u2019s spectacular 32-inch, 4K, 240Hz QD-OLED panel. And, yes, it looks absolutely stunning, as is true of all the monitors I saw with this panel.\nHP separates this monitor from the pack with a few useful features that focus on content creation and productivity. It\u2019s the world\u2019s first OLED gaming monitor that can deliver 140 watts of power over USB-C. It also has a \u201csmart KVM switch\u201d that can detect which device you\u2019re using and swap on the fly. The monitor is actively cooled, as well, a feature HP says should reduce the risk of OLED burn-in.\nFeatures aside, I also think the Omen Transcend is the most attractive of all the 32-inch 4K OLED monitors shown at CES 2024. It pairs a modern white-on-black look with a bright RGB-LED accent light on the rear.\nPricing and availability has not been announced.\nAuthor: Matthew S. Smith\nMatthew S.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 preview: the news and rumours ahead of January's huge electronics show\nHere's what to expect from the biggest TV, AV and audio electronics show of the year\nCES is the world\u2019s biggest annual consumer technology show, held in Las Vegas in January, where thousands of consumer electronics brands show off their latest innovations.\nCES 2023 hosted roughly 2400 exhibitors including huge names such as Google, Amazon, Microsoft, Sony, LG, Samsung, Panasonic and JBL.\nThe event is often where we get a first glimpse at what these companies will launch that year and beyond. This January we saw demos of next-gen TVs from the likes of LG, Panasonic and Samsung. There were also plenty of audio announcements, too, with launches from JBL, Naim, and Nakamichi.\nPress conferences, keynotes, and tech talks are all made available online via live streams, so you can tune in and follow everything as it happens from the comfort of your seat.\nWhat Hi-Fi? will be in attendance, as always, bringing you all of the news from on the ground, plus hands-ons with all of the latest and greatest kit and opinions on what we've seen.\nIn the meantime, though, here's everything we know and think we know about what's going to be announced at the show.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the 7th and 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2024 news: what will be announced?\nIt\u2019s early days so it\u2019s difficult to know exactly what will be shown. Brands haven't announced much yet and keynote speeches and press conference times are still to be confirmed by many brands. But based on past launches, brand activities over the past 12 months, and some early teasers, we can speculate on what could come out of this January\u2019s show.\nAs we find out more, we will be sure to keep you up to date with all the latest news.\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT\nLivestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different. We anticipate a whole new TV range to be announced, with the focus clearly placed on the brand's dominant OLED models.\nIn fact, we already know that new B4, C4 and G4 models are on the way, thanks to a recent leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates of those models (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4). Rumours also point to this being the year that LG's TVs launch with an entirely new Alpha 10 processor rather than a tweaked version of the slightly long-in-the-tooth Alpha 9.\nWe're most looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 has trickled down to the mainstream C4 model this year. That would be a very big deal. It would also arguably be a very big deal if it hasn't.\nWe're also keen to see whether LG announces a new version of its 'wireless' M3 OLED TV, or perhaps a completely different concept TV. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA at LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company have shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT\nLivestream: TBA\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT\nLivestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nPress conference: TBA\nLivestream: TBA\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES. At the moment, however, any specifics on what they may release are yet to be confirmed.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz. There\u2019s also MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nChristmas Gift Guide 2023: the best gift ideas for music, film and tech fans\nStars of CES 2023: the 10 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

At CES 2024, we can expect to see everything from TVs to laptops, from smartphones to smart tractors. Basically if it runs off of electricity, it'll be at the show.\nCES 2024 technically starts tomorrow, but there have already been a ton of announcements, and the week is just getting started. We're live on the show floor, though, and we'll continue to update this article each day with the latest CES 2024 announcements.. Not everything will actually come to market, but we will get a pretty good idea what products will look like over the next year or so.\nCES 2024: When Is It Happening?\nCES 2024 kicks off on January 9, but CES Unveiled, the press conference that highlights the major trends at the show, happens on January 7 at 5PM PST (8PM EST). However, unlike many other trade shows which are all about the main keynote, CES is a more prolonged beast. Tech manufacturers from all over the world will have their own keynotes, or will just have gadgets on the show floor to show off.\nThis is why it's a good idea to stay tuned to IGN, as we'll be keeping our eyes open for the strange new technology that is scattered around the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nWhat is CES?\nCES stands for the Consumer Electronics Show, an annual industry-only tradeshow that features all the newest technology coming to market over the next couple of years. The show isn't really meant to show new products per se, but rather the tech and trends that are going to be powering the new products.\nEverything Announced at CES 2024 So Far\nNvidia Launches Super-Powered Graphics Cards\nNvidia has announced three new graphics cards, the GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super and RTX 4070 Super, replacing the RTX 4080, 4070 Ti and 4070, respectively. This is a classic mid-generation refresh looking to convince more folks to upgrade their PCs. The first of these cards to hit the market will be the GeForce RTX 4070 Super, which comes out on January 17, but don't worry, all three will be out by the end of the month.\nMSI Is Here to Claw Some of the Handheld Gaming PC Market From Asus and Valve\nThe best handheld gaming PCs are here to stay, and the latest is the MSI Claw. Rather than being powered by the AMD Z1 chip, like the Lenovo Legion Go and the Asus ROG Ally, the Claw is powered by the new Intel Core Ultra processor, backed by Intel Arc graphics. Onboard graphics are usually a bad word when it comes to PC gaming, but this time around both Intel and MSI seem confident in what this chip can do. I know I'm excited to put it through its paces, and see how it compares to the Steam Deck and the ROG Ally.\nApple Swoops In With a Surprise Vision Pro Announcement\nWhile Apple technically isn't here in Las Vegas for CES, the Cupertino giant did take some of the spotlight when it suddenly announced a release date for the Apple Vision Pro, the company's take on a VR/AR headset. Preorders for the headset go live January 19th, and it will officially hit the market on February 2. That's not much longer to wait for a product that we thought was going to keep getting pushed back. Let's just hope it's worth that $3,499 price tag.\nSony and Honda Drive Cars With a DualSense Controller\nSony and Honda teamed up at CES to show off the Honda Afeela driven with a Sony DualSense controller. That's exciting for sure, but it's important to keep in mind that this is just a tech demo and not something that is guaranteed to come to market. And, honestly, it's probably safe to assume it will, at least any time soon. Doesn't stop it from looking cool as hell, though.\nWhat To Expect From CES 2024\nTL;DR: Here's What to Expect\nIt's hard to even think about CES 2024 without bringing up AI. Not only have AI-based language models like Chat GPT been the center of conversation all year, but both Intel and AMD have announced new processors that'll have silicon dedicated to AI workloads. Couple that with the fact Apple has had a Neural Engine built into its processors since the M1 hit the market in 2020 means that LLMs (language learning models) and AI-based image generation are going to be processed locally on the best laptops, rather than in the cloud.\nDon't worry, gaming is totally going to be affected by this too. Ever since the Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 in 2019, Nvidia's graphics cards have shipped with Tensor Cores which are purpose-built to handle machine learning workloads. This is the hardware behind the hugely-successful DLSS, or Deep-Learning Super Sampling. So, you can expect Nvidia to show up in Vegas to show off what's coming next for their own special AI upscaling secret sauce.\n2023 has also been huge for handheld gaming. The Steam Deck OLED, Lenovo Legion Go and Asus ROG Ally have all made waves for basically being a Nintendo Switch that can run all your favorite Steam games on the go. However, all of these systems are basically using the same AMD Z1 chipset. It'd be nice to see AMD come out with a new chipset that can show off the next generation of handheld gaming. Or, even better, if Nvidia or Intel came out with something similar that can introduce some competition to that space.\nBeyond gaming, we're likely to hear something from smartwatch manufacturers, especially after Apple announced it would stop selling its flagship smartwatches, according to a report from 9to5Mac. This comes via a lawsuit around Apple using imported blood oxygen level-monitoring technology. So, either we're going to see a new company take on this challenge or we're going to at least hear some kind of discussion about how best to move forward.\nCES 2024 is going to be full of surprises too. Every year the LVCC show floor is packed with inventive little gadgets that really push the boundaries of what's possible with technology. So, be sure to keep this page bookmarked, as we'll keep it updated with the coolest tech CES 2024 has to offer.\nIGNRecommends"
