        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Supernal is a part of the Hyundai Motor Group. (AP Photo/John Locher, File)\nCES provides an annual insight into where and how cutting-edge innovations will reshape how people work, study, communicate and, in many cases, how they\u2019ll drive. This year CES saw a number of automakers present concept vehicles that seem both years into the future and on the very cusp of production.\nFrom flying vehicles and AI-powered voice assistants to the latest in EVs, CES 2024 offers a peek into what you\u2019ll be driving \u2014 or what might be driving you \u2014 in the years ahead. The automotive experts at Edmunds have rounded up some of this year\u2019s most notable automotive debuts.\nARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE COMES TO YOUR CAR\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is poised to reshape countless aspects of daily life. While there are plenty of concerns and opportunities involved, it\u2019s clear that automakers will be moving ahead to use AI for what they hope will be a more helpful and optimistic driving future.\nMercedes-Benz, for its part, debuted its next-generation AI virtual assistant software. The upcoming version of Mercedes\u2019 MBUX infotainment interface, dubbed MB.OS, will feature conversational voice commands and far more nuanced responses. For example, by monitoring voice instructions and driving behavior, the AI system can determine if a driver is hurried and stressed or cruising along carefree. A version of MB.OS is set to debut in Mercedes\u2019 upcoming electric-powered CLA sedan.\nAnother German automaker, Volkswagen, says it will integrate ChatGPT, the popular AI chatbot, into its vehicles to provide more voice interaction beyond what\u2019s currently available. For example, the car\u2019s existing voice command features will work for things like navigation, climate control or general knowledge requests. But something it can\u2019t handle will be forwarded anonymously to ChatGPT. ChatGPT will then respond in a seamless Volkswagen voice and style. For now, Volkswagen has not said when this functionality will be available on its vehicles sold in the United States.\nHONDA\u2019S HEADED BACK TO THE FUTURE\nReliable, efficient and out-of-this-world wild. Which one of these descriptors is not often attributed to the practically minded Honda Motor Co.? In the near future, all of them look to apply to Honda\u2019s upcoming lineup of electric vehicles, dubbed the 0 Series. Taking design cues from seemingly everything from a ground-hugging sports car to a 1980s-era Dustbuster vacuum cleaner, the Honda Saloon concept vehicle is a hint at the Japanese automaker\u2019s EV strategy and upcoming designs.\nWith its wedge-shaped body, truncated tail and upward-swinging doors, the Honda Saloon is a head-turning sedan that hints at a production model due in 2026. It will also debut the latest in EV technology, such as a more efficient and longer-lasting battery pack. Just don\u2019t expect that the Saloon\u2019s glowing front grille, gullwing doors and yoke-style steering wheel are all part of the finished product.\nELECTRIC FLYING CARS PROMISE TO BECOME REALITY\nFlying cars seem like something straight out of a science fiction movie, yet they were very much in the here and now at CES 2024. One of the most head-turning is the eVTOL Flying Car created by Chinese automaker XPeng. Equal parts low-lying supercar and high-flying helicopter, this wedge-shaped concept is wildly futuristic and entirely electric powered.\nNotably, the company\u2019s concept isn\u2019t a flying car in the traditional sense. It doesn\u2019t have wings and uses its electrically powered fans to produce lift and fly straight up. It can theoretically take off and land anywhere there\u2019s room, making travel as a sort of gridlock-avoiding city vehicle more likely.\nAnother electric helicopter-like entry at the show was the Supernal S-A2. Supernal is notable for being an offshoot of Hyundai. The connection to the giant South Korean automaker certainly adds some plausibility to the S-A2 turning into reality. The S-A2\u2019s specs aren\u2019t mind-boggling, with a maximum range of just 25-40 miles, but that might be all you need for an aerial taxi.\nSupernal says it hopes the S-A2 will be a production reality by 2028. Still, don\u2019t get your hopes up too much that your daily commute is about to take flight. Wait-and-see is the best approach as other vital details such as price and success overcoming regulatory hurdles all remain very much up in the air.\n_______\nThis story was provided to The Associated Press by the automotive website Edmunds.\nNick Kurczewski is a contributor at Edmunds and is on Twitter and Instagram\nCopyright 2024 The Associated Press.

Empowering them isn't just good for morale; it's smart business.\n- Flattening Hierarchies: The shift from rigid corporate structures to more fluid and responsive ones is more relevant today than ever, especially in our era of rapid change and innovation.\n- Clear Goal and Vision/Mission: Stressing the importance of having a well-defined goal and a clear vision/mission, which are essential for guiding an organization towards success and maintaining focus on its objectives.\n- Adaptability and Innovation: Underlining the necessity of adaptability and innovation in the evolving global business landscape.\nCarlzon's vision about leadership, organizational culture, and the importance of adaptability are not just historical lessons; they are blueprints for contemporary and future success.\nAs I delve back into the pages of this insightful book, I'm reminded of the enduring power of visionary leadership and the importance of constantly challenging the status quo. Whether you're a budding entrepreneur, a seasoned executive, or somewhere in between, \"Riv pyramiderna\" offers valuable lessons that transcend time.\n#Leadership #BusinessStrategy #CustomerCentricity #EmployeeEmpowerment #Innovation #RivPyramiderna #JanCarlzon\nI'm curious to hear your thoughts:\nContent type not supported\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\nCreative and innovative leader proficient in technology, expertly steering product and software development with a positive mindset, always ready to embrace challenges!\nEver heard of the \"Red Car Theory\"?\nAccording to this quirky idea, when you're not actively looking for something (like a red car), it's almost impossible to find it. But when you start actively searching for it, suddenly, it's everywhere!\nNow, let's apply this theory to life. Have you been feeling like you haven't come across any opportunities for personal growth or career advancement lately? Maybe it's not that they don't exist, but rather that you haven't been actively seeking them out.\nTake a quick experiment - ask yourself, \"Have I seen any red cars today?\" Chances are, you haven't. But as soon as you start looking for them, you'll start seeing them everywhere!\nSo, how can you become a \"Red Car Detective\" in your own life? Set goals for what you want to find, stay curious, network with others, keep learning, and embrace change.\nRemember, life is like a giant game of 'Spot the Red Car.'\nYou might not see the opportunities at first, but with a bit of humor and a keen eye, you'll start spotting them everywhere, just like finding Waldo in a crowd of stripe-wearing imposters.\nHappy friday & hunting!\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\nCreative and innovative leader proficient in technology, expertly steering product and software development with a positive mindset, always ready to embrace challenges!\nDiscover the innovation behind the vehicle mind with\u00c2\u00a0ECARX.

In addition, the contrast filter can be turned up for a more normal viewing experience.The Signature T TV is nearly all-wireless too.

It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display.

It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024.

Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels.

It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use.

The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "Inside-Out Phones, Folding TVs: Behold The Eye-Popping Tech of CES 2024\nThe world's largest consumer tech show is a showcase of incredible innovation, and this is the cream of the crop.\nWe got an eyeful of a 137-inch TV that folds and unfolds, here at CES 2024.\nCES 2024\u00a0is full of innovative delights,\u00a0futuristic concepts, practical products you can\u00a0preorder or buy today\u00a0and some of the\u00a0strangest tech to stumble across our paths. Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives.\nAs we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of\u00a0ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies,\u00a0new car tech, gaming gear and robots\u00a0-- there's even a robot for your dog.\nHere's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.\nRead more: \u00a0The Best of Show at CES 2024.\nAR/VR glasses that fit in one room\nApple may have stolen the show in absentia announcing that the Vision Pro would be available next month, but the headset is still insanely expensive at $3,500. While it's yet to be seen whether\u00a0AR/VR technology will take off, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, including the intriguing-looking Xreal Air 2 Ultra ($699). The Xreal is a lot more compact than the Apple behemoth, the price is relatively competitive and CNET's Lisa Eadiciccio was impressed by its image quality. However, she says the headset still needs to be tethered to another device, and it'll need third-party developers if it's to have a chance against Apple or even Google.\nA portable, add-on OLED display that folds\nSecondary displays are a productivity godsend, enabling the kind of multitasking that isn't possible even with the widest monitors. While portable solutions are available, the best solutions tend to be tethered to your desk. Maker Asus says the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH is the first portable OLED display -- and as the name suggests, it also folds! With the superior image quality of OLED, this 17.3-incher should be great for on-the-go movies or gaming, when it hits later in 2024.\nHitch a ride on a flying EV taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the debut of the Supernal S-A2.\nBanish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design\u00a0and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter. As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.\nThe future is electric\nHonda promises that the Saloon will match \"the joy of driving\" with steer-by-wire technology.\nAs we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle that could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the \"board room on wheels\" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs!\nThe most impressive, and most-likely concept to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing \"steer-by-wire\" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new \"floating H\" logo.\nFoldable phones? How about a foldable TV?\nThe C Seed N1, unfolded.\nWhat to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch C Seed N1 showed off at CES 2024.\nThe custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture,\nand its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk\nin about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV.\nOh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nSteam Deck has a new challenger\nMSI's new game handheld runs Windows but has Intel inside.\nAfter years of near misses such as the Steam Machine, the Steam Deck was an unexpected success for Valve, and the console is the current standard for mobile PC gaming. While the competing\u00a0Asus ROG Ally looked cool, using Windows on it was apparently pretty clunky. Now that situation might change with the help of Intel -- the company has a lot of experience making Windows machines. MSI's Claw handheld obviously owes a debt to the Steam Deck, but it has Intel's new Meteor Lake chips onboard instead of AMD chips. CNET's Scott Stein says this development means more manufacturers will have the opportunity to design their own Steam Deck-alikes that can also run Windows.\nWhat's old is new\nIf\nyou consider yourself an old-school smartphone user, you may yearn for\nthe physical keyboards that used to be a mainstay of the phones of\nyesteryear. The iPhone's on-screen keyboard ushered out the full\nphysical keyboards that were popular on\u00a0BlackBerry\u00a0devices.\nThe Clicks keyboard,\nfrom Clicks Technology, will transform your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15\nPro and Pro Max, adding a keyboard that's actually integrated into a\nwraparound case. This $139 wraparound slides onto your device and runs\noff the phone's battery, so no charging required. Be sure to check out our hands-on review.\nThis phone bends over backward for you\nAs phones with screens that fold in half get more consumer attention, Samsung appears to be poised to flip the market again. The electronics giant showcased a concept handset at\u00a0CES 2024 called the Flex In & Out Flip that can fold in both directions and completely backward, allowing you to use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nWhen bent backward, one side is slightly shorter than the other, to avoid covering the camera, while the larger side was big enough to show several icons in the phone's quick settings menu, media playback controls and the time and battery level. Although the handset is only a concept design right now, CNET's Lisa Eadicicco points out that it might offer a hint at the future of devices that roll, flex, bend, fold and otherwise contort to adapt tech to our unique needs.\nGet to work with this gaming laptop\nMore and more, we're asking our laptops to do double duty. In addition to strong gaming performance, we want to be able to use these thinner, lightweight devices for work or school. The HP Omen Transcend 14, which made its debut at CES 2024, is light enough for a daily commute but sports a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display with a 48-120Hz variable refresh rate backed up by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070.\nThe 14-inch laptop weighs only 3.6 pounds (1.6 kilograms) -- light for a gaming laptop and has battery life good for up to 11.5 hours with the integrated graphics and an Eco mode. The new 14-inch size starts at $1,500. A 16-inch version will also be available with the option for a 4K 240Hz OLED starting at $1,900.\nThis thermometer also checks your heart and lungs\nIf you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer,\nelectrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was\nunveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you \"beam it,\" the device can give you clues about your health.\nThe device, which Withings describes as being \"portable and smaller than a smartphone,\"\ncombines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of\nthe wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like\nblood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used\nas a \"digital stethoscope.\"\nFollowing expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nForget a projector, get a huge TCL instead\nThe TCL 115QM891G is a 115-inch TV that's 8.5 feet wide and around 6 feet tall on its stand.\nCNET's projector reviewer Geoff Morrison has been extolling the benefits of projectors for many years, but even he has come around to technologies like OLED and Mini-LED of late. What would he think of the new TCL 115QM891G? This is a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's up to five times brighter than most TVs, and with better blacks too, according to TV reviewer David Katzmaier.\nAs TV reviewers ourselves we've seen large TVs, but in the old days they were stuck at HD. The pixels on Panasonic's\u00a0103-inch 1080p, for instance, were huge and easily noticeable. This is why 4K technology is so great -- it means you can install a TV as big as a wall, and not see black lines between the pixels. The TCL is also going to be a lot cheaper than that $100,000 Panasonic too, at under $20,000.\nStained glass gets a new lease on lifelong power\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nSolar panels are great -- they produce electricity from one of the most abundant resources we have, and they pay for themselves in quick order -- but no one has ever called them pretty. Fear not! Japanese company inQs has worked out a way to make solar cells out of colored glass. The company is exhibiting a number of objects at CES 2024, including a\u00a0stained glass pane that generates electricity. The devices are small, and one was able to power only a desk fan, but we like how they point to a rethink of how solar panels should look and work.\nDisguising weird-looking things has been a perpetual trend at CES, as with LG's ArtCool air conditioners. And this year the Samsung Music Frame lets you put art inside a smart speaker.\nHey, Ida, which is better: Alexa or Siri?\nAI is already everywhere here at CES 2024 -- and adding to the list of products it'll be appearing in is cars. Volkswagen has announced a deal with ChatGPT that\u00a0enables users to ask all sorts of questions of their car, in the same way they would of a traditional digital assistant. At the moment, VW's voice assistant lets users say, \"Hey, Ida,\" to ask a question about something basic, like requesting tire pressure. But the automaker's cars are incapable of answering more advanced questions like, \"When did the New York Jets last win the Super Bowl?\" Under the new deal, if the car's assistant can't answer the question, it'll hand off the query to ChatGPT. (Yes, the Jets did win one. But it was a very, very long time ago.)\nIt's worth noting that competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri have been completing these queries natively for many years, so teaming with ChatGPT is an easier way for VW's Ida to catch up.\nMust-see-through TV\nThis transparent display, currently showing fish, can transform into a 77-inch TV.\nTVs are getting bigger every year, which means there's a bigger slab of black plastic taking up a significant portion of the living room wall when it's not in use. But what if we could make it disappear, without actually pulling it off the wall?\nLG has apparently done just that with a\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0that converts from a \"fish tank\" to a 77-inch television (pictured above). Unlike Samsung's competing technology this will apparently be a real product, shipping later in 2024.\nMeanwhile Samsung is showing off the first transparent version of its\u00a0Micro-LED display tech\u00a0at\u00a0CES 2024. While transparent OLED and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, Samsung says its Micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the current tech. But Samsung says its transparent Micro-LED tech isn't available in the market, so what Katzmaier saw (or didn't see?) is essentially a concept.\nA 2-minute ice cream maker\nWe scream for ice cream.\nComing soon to a restaurant near you: freshly made ice cream, ready from start to finish in just 2 minutes.\nWe've loved trying the vanilla ice cream churned out by the speedy ColdSnap -- first in 2021 and then again this year. We're still a year away from being able to buy one of these innovative ice cream makers for our homes, but the company came to CES this year with the news that its restaurant partners will have hold of the machines much sooner.\nThe countertop ice cream maker uses Keurig-like pods to make a bowl of the cold stuff in less than 2 minutes. The finished result has a gelato-like consistency that had us coming back for more every time we passed the ColdSnap booth.\nRobot stain fighter\nSamsung is set to unveil its Bespoke Jet Bot Combo this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nHere's a product sure to clean up -- literally. Samsung's new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, a smart robot vacuum with a mop, does more than just get rid of dust bunnies and dog hair. It's designed to roam your rooms scouting for stains on hard flooring and scrub them out so you don't have to.\nThe robot taps AI-powered object recognition to identify stains on hard flooring. Yes, it can tell the difference between the surfaces, presumably making adjustments to its cleaning technique accordingly. You can also tell this likely $1,000-plus household helper where it can and can't go as it attacks stains as bad as a puppy piddle or a zinfandel spill with a spinning mop that hits 170 rpm. (Pricing details aren't yet available.)\nTeeth tech\nAI isn't just helping keep your floors clean, it's also being used to make sure your teeth are as clean as they can be. The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush features an algorithm-controlled motor, five brush modes tailored to specific needs, an interactive touchscreen that shows you areas you missed and, brilliantly/weirdly, an AI voice guide that speaks into your brain via bone conduction to help you improve your technique.\nIt also features Wi-Fi connectivity so you can pair it with your home network, and it will store information about your brushing history until you can download it to your app. It also offers 40 days of battery life through wireless charging. It will go on sale in the US in the fall for $130.\nIt's all in the wristwatch remote\nWhat if your smartwatch could also control your lamps, your Netflix programs and more?\nImagine using your wrist to control everything around you. A flick this way, and you can turn off the lights or scroll through the offerings on Netflix. Finnish startup Doublepoint has developed software that can turn an Android watch into a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection.\nThe software will come to developers in the first half of this year,\nbut it's up to developers and app-makers to decide what a small gesture, such as tapping fingers or rotating your wrist, will actually do.\nSteven Musil, Sareena Dayaram, Katie Collins and Ty Pendlebury contributed to this article.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"
