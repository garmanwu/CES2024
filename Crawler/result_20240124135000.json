Telos has occupied the site since at least 2014 and is reportedly leased until 2029.\nWhether Finmarc aims to demolish the existing buildings and construct new facilities or retrofit the existing buildings is unclear.\nBJ reports, however, that Finmarc isn\u2019t looking to develop the data center until 2026. This may be due to the energy capacity crunch the Ashburn area is suffering which is limiting new data center developments. The crunch is set to end around 2026 with the installation of new power lines.\nBJ also notes the early filing may help the company avoid future restrictions around building data centers along Route 7.
