        "raw_content": "The Robot Report\nTop 10 robots seen at CES 2024\nBy Mike Oitzman | January 13, 2024\nLAS VEGAS \u2014 CES 2024 featured a wide range of emerging technologies, from fitness devices and videogames to autonomous vehicles. But robots always have a significant presence in the sprawling exhibit halls.\nThe Robot Report visited numerous booths in the Eureka Park section of CES, as well as in the other focused sections of the event. Here are some highlights from this week\u2019s event:\nMobinn climbs stairway toward success\nMobinn is a Korean startup focused on last-mile autonomous delivery vehicles. While the concept of last-mile delivery isn\u2019t new, Mobinn demonstrated an innovative wheeled robot that can climb stairs.\nThe robot is capable of going up and down stairs through the implementation of compliant wheels. A self-leveling box on top of the robot keeps the cargo level, so your drinks and food don\u2019t spill out of their containers.\nGlidance guides people with vision impairments\nThe latest prototype of the Glidance device is fully functional for public demos and includes a camera in the handle and radar sensors in the base. | Credit: The Robot Report\nRoboBusiness PitchFire 2023 winner Glidance also won a CES 2024 Innovation Award and showed the latest functional prototype of its Glide device in its booth. The robotic Glide guides sight-impaired individuals similar to a guide dog.\nThe startup is designing Glide to be affordable and easy to learn how to use when it starts shipping later this year. I tried Glide firsthand (while closing my eyes). The experience was incredible, and I can only imagine how promising this technology would be for an individual with sight loss.\nThe team at Glidance mentioned to me that celebrity Stevie Wonder came to the Glidance booth for a demo of the product during CES.\nUnitree H1 humanoid steals the show\nThere were two full-size humanoid robots at CES 2024.\nKepler Robotics had a stationary model of the new Kepler Forerunner K1 in its Eureka Park booth. The robot includes 14 linear-axis motors and 14 rotary-axis motors. Unfortunately, the company was unable to give live demos of the Forerunner.\nThe Unitree H1 humanoid robot uses sensors in its \u201chead\u201d to perceive the world around the robot as it navigates and avoids obstacles. | Credit: The Robot Report\nThe internet influencer darling of CES has to be the Unitree H1 humanoid, and the company was giving nearly continuous live demos of the H1 at its booth.\nKudos to the Unitree marketing team for its now-infamous \u201ckick the robot\u201d videos that have been shared on social media over the past six months. In the videos, H1 appears to be a solid humanoid platform with respectable balance and agility.\nHowever, as a longtime robotics industry insider and experienced robotics applications engineer, I thought the Unitree H1 product demos at CES 2024 were cringe-worthy, as the Unitree demo team walked the H1 robot into crowds of \u201cinternet tech influencers\u201d with their cameras ablaze.\nThe 150 lb. (68 kg) robot danced with the public inches away. A single tripping incident would have sent the robot tumbling into an innocent bystander and made instant headlines. It would have been a public relations disaster and a setback for the industry.\nHowever, there\u2019s no denying that the H1 was a crowd favorite at CES 2024, and the company and its robot received a lot of news media attention.\nHyundai displays future mobility tech at CES 2024\nHyundai PnD Module concept\nThe company had multiple large-scale booths showing autonomy concepts for the future, including autonomous mobility for both humans and freight, as well as a look at the future of autonomous construction vehicles. Unfortunately, I didn\u2019t get to witness either of the live mobility demonstrations, but the Hyundai Construction Xite concept tractor was an impressive incarnation of autonomous construction designs.\nHyundai presented a concept for the future of autonomous construction equipment with the display of the Construction Xite tractor (Editors note: for scale, the bucket arm is over 10 ft tall). | Credit: The Robot Report\nAV24 rolls into the showroom\nThe Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC) had an impressive booth in the automotive hall of CES 2024, surrounded by well-known brand names. On display was a fully functional version of the newest AV24 autonomous racecar, showing off the integration of an entirely new autonomy stack in the vehicle.\nThe IAC has partnered with many of the leading automotive technology companies to embed the latest lidar, radar, vision, and GPS sensors within the vehicle.\ndSpace announced an extended partnership with IAC that will deliver digital twins of each university team\u2019s vehicle along with digital twins of each of the race tracks. In turn, these will enable the teams to train the AI drivers completely in simulation and then port the AI models and drive code directly the physical race cars.\nIn addition, some sanctioned sim races are possible later this year, said the IAC organizers.\nEmbodied AI displays updated Moxie\nThe latest generation of Moxie by Embodied AI was on display in Amazon\u2019s booth at CES. Embodied recently announced new tutoring functionality with the latest software release for Moxie, and it demonstrated the software at the expo.\nAmazon had a separate expo suite that featured all of the physical Amazon consumer and smart home products (Amazon Astro was noticeably absent from the display). Moxie entertained the gathered crowds as it demonstrated its interactivity.\nFingervision measures gripper force\nMy \u201cUnknown Discovery\u201d award of CES 2024 goes to a young Japanese startup called Fingervision. This was a serendipitous discovery of an innovation that uses tiny cameras built into the gripper fingers of an industrial robot,\nThey provide feedback on the grip force and \u201cslippage\u201d of an item held with the gripper. This is accomplished by imaging the area where the fingers touch an object through an opaque surface. Thus the origin of the company name.\nThe company has deployed its first grippers into an application where robots are picking up fried chicken nuggets and packaging them.\nHonorable mentions from CES 2024\nGatik keeps on trucking \u2014 autonomously\nGatik showed the third generation of its on-road autonomous truck. The company has made its mark on autonomous logistics through the deployment of driving algorithms that plans paths so that the vehicle only makes right-hand turns, avoiding more complex and dangerous left-hand turns.\nGatik first demonstrated fully driverless, freight-only commercial deliveries on the middle mile with Walmart in 2021. Shortly after, it\u00a0executed the first fully driverless deployment for Canada\u2019s largest retailer, Loblaw.\nThe company also announced a partnership with Goodyear tires to develop \u201cSmart Tires\u201d that can provide real-time feedback to the autonomous driver with data about the condition of the tires to help maintain traction and control.\nBobcat Rogue X2 gets ready to move the earth\nAt CES 2024, Bobcat showed off an autonomous concept prototype, the Bobcat Rogue X2, at CES 2024. The all-electric, autonomous robot is designed for handling material movement and ground-altering operations at construction, mining, and agriculture sites.\nThe design prototype of the Rogue X2 at CES had wheels rather than tracks, but manually driven Bobcats can be equipped with tracks, so a production version of the Rogue could have similar configurations.\nOttonomy IO partners with Harbor Lockers\nThrough a new partnership with Harbor Lockers, the latest generation of Ottobot can now be configured with a payload of Harbor Lockers. This includes the Harbor Locker physical locker infrastructure, as well as the Harbor Locker application interface.\nThis is the first time that Ottonomy is partnering with a third-party vendor to extend the autonomous last-mile delivery solution.\nLawn-mowing robots arrive in North America\nCES is one of the world\u2019s biggest consumer electronics shows. While The Robot\u00a0Report doesn\u2019t typically cover consumer robotics, it is notable that lawn-mowing robotics were ubiquitous at CES this year, with a dozen vendors showing their autonomous systems.\nThe European market for consumer lawnmowers is already mature, but the North American market is in the early stages of adoption. Without testing all of the different lawnmowing robots, it\u2019s difficult to determine the market leaders, but the two most promising solutions that I saw at the show included the new Yarbo Lawn Mower and the latest generation of Navimow from Segway Robotics.\nmowers-navimow\nMike Oitzman is Editor of WTWH's Robotics Group and founder of the Mobile Robot Guide.

        "raw_content": "All the Robots We Met At CES 2024, in One Place\nImprovements in AI are making robots more fun than ever.\nSome things in life are guaranteed: death and taxes, sure, but also that there will be robots at CES. I've met many robots at the Las Vegas tech show over the years -- I've even played Cards Against Humanity and table tennis against a couple of them -- and it's always been a highlight of the event for me.\nAs anticipated, the robots are back in force at CES 2024. Some have an element of personality to them, often through the inclusion of some kind of recognizable facial features, while others are just busy little autonomous machines with a job too. To our delight, many of them are making food and drink that we've been snaffling as we roam the convention center halls. Referring to these countertop machines as robots might have you asking what actually defines a robot -- but worry not, it's a question we answered all the way back at CES 2017.\nAn unfortunate side note: Most of the robots we've seen at CES never make it out of the show and into the wider world, and certainly not into our homes. The huge leaps forward in AI we've seen over the past few years give me hope that home robots may yet make the leap off the show floor. AI is fundamental to the functioning of autonomous machines such as robots, and more advanced AI could well lead to robots that are capable of doing more than trimming our lawns and vacuuming our floors.\nIn the meantime, here's the closest thing we currently have to what our robot overlords are up to this year.\nSamsung Ballie\nWe'll start the petition for Samsung to put Ballie on sale.\nThe return of Samsung's Ballie to CES didn't come as a surprise. First unveiled at CES 2020, Ballie disappeared for a few years before bouncing back new with a built-in projector.\nBallie is a combo of companion entertainer and security guard. It can follow you around your house with its wheels, analyze your posture using its camera and stream content for you. It's also bright yellow, making it cute and hopefully so visible that you don't trip over it in spite of its diminutive size.\nThe big question for Samsung is whether this cute little home robot will ever be more than a prop it brings out to delight during press conferences? There's no price or release date for Ballie at the moment, so don't get your hopes up.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo\nSamsung's Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, awaiting a mess to clean up.\nBallie wasn't the only robot Samsung brought to CES this year (even if it was the most fun). The far more practical Bespoke Jet Bot Combo is an all-star mopping and vacuuming machine that can clean up your red wine spill without you even having to leave the sofa.\nWith its AI-powered object recognition, it knows where to go and where not to go. Samsung even promises that you can trust it do its thing without falling down the stairs. We love an independent queen.\nOro Dog Companion\nIf Oro can't solve the issue on its own, it will alert you remotely to your dog's most pressing needs.\nWhat's cuter than your dog? Absolutely nothing, of course. But with its baffled face and snowman-esque stature, the Oro Dog Companion is trying its best.\nAs well as two-way audio and video that allows you to keep an eye on and communicate with your pup while you're away from home, the Oro can play with your furry friend, feed them treats and learn about them to recognize signs of distress or restlessness. If you're worried about separation anxiety or simply want your pet to have the very best that money can buy, you can buy this robot soon for $799.\nLenovo Magic Bay Robot\nLenovo's Magic Bay Robot is certainly cute.\nWhether you work in an office or from home, computer-based jobs can be lonely gigs sometimes. Imagine, then, that you have a small friend perched atop your screen, ready to flash you a smile whenever you need it -- a sort of physical Clippy for the 21st century.\nLenovo's Magic Bay Robot will do just that -- and if we're honest, not much else right now. Lenovo brought this small webcam-shaped bot to CES as more of a proof of concept, showing off what could be a compact personal assistant in future, once loaded up with AI skills. It's a sweet idea that we're excited to see evolve further (roll on CES 2025).\nYarbo\nYarbo's here to save you on a snow day.\nMost robots are indoorsy creatures, vulnerable as they are to the elements. But there's an entire breed of bots that are built for outdoor work, and are therefore more rugged.\nEnter the burly, mononymous Yarbo, a modular robot that will shovel snow and blow leaves so you don't have to. Different attachments equip it to complete a range of outdoorsy tasks, allowing you to watch it from your window with a lovely warm cup of coffee. Such luxuries don't come cheap, of course. The body is $4,499, and additional components range from $1,499 to $2,459 in price.\nAI at CES 2024: Take a Look at the Coolest Tech From the Show\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"

Though AI was mainly represented in\u00a0chatbots\u00a0in the past year, companies are now finding more innovative ways to incorporate the technology into hardware, including everything from futuristic robots to laptops to products that would have never been possible before.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWith so many AI-related announcements at CES this year, it can be difficult to distinguish between what's simple AI-washing and what's actual visionary technology. To help you understand what's most important, I've created a roundup of the AI and robots that have distinguished themselves from the rest based on factors such as helpfulness, uniqueness, and real-world applications.\nWith two press days and two event days down, I have seen a majority of what CES has to offer, including A LOT of product demos. To find out what my top picks for the best AI-infused products at CES are, keep reading. Also, most of my picks also happen to have won CES 2024 Innovation Awards, showing just how good these devices are.\n1. Motion Pillow\nThe Motion Pillow uses AI to help tackle snoring problems and give you a better night's sleep. The AI Motion System detects a user's snoring and slowly inflates airbags to lift their head and open their airway to reduce it. The accompanying app tracks sleep data, including snoring time, airbag operation time, sleep score, sleep time, and even recordings of your snoring to play back later.\nTo build on the technology, the company also introduced an accompanying Motion Ring to monitor your sleep status in real time and send data to the motion system for a more seamless experience. The combination of the ring with the pillow, known as motionsleep, earned the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.\nThe Motion Pillow alone costs $699, but it's 40% off during the CES exhibition period, retailing at $420.\n2. Bmind Smart Mirror\nThe Bmind Smart Mirror claims to be the world's first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness, according to manufacturer Baracoda. Leveraging generative AI, the mirror can provide personalized recommendations, such as light therapy sessions, guided meditation, and self-affirmations based on your mental state, to help improve your mood and manage stress.\nWhen I demoed the mirror, it asked me how my day was, and for testing purposes, I said it went terribly. Immediately, the mirror said encouraging words to me, switched the lights to a calming blue color, displayed an image of nature, and encouraged me to start a meditation session.\nThe mirror was even recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Smart Home category.\n3. Minitailz Smart Dog Collar\nIf you are a dog mom like me, you're probably always thinking of ways you could make your pet's quality of life better. Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar is a fitness tracker for your dog, and can help you better understand what they need.\nThe tracker detects a dog's GPS location to ensure your fur baby never gets lost, along with health stats such as resting heart rate and breathing. The company claims that the collars can detect early signs of heart failure before the onset of symptoms. The collar also offers AI-driven activity detection with real-time alerts that can let the pert owner know exactly what their pet is doing.\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category.\nIf you are interested, the Minitailz collar is available for $99. However, there is also a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\n4. Yarbo Multi-Purpose Intelligent Yard Robot\nTaking care of your yard can be a hassle, with the grass alone requiring cutting, fertilizing, and watering. The Yarbo multi-purpose yard robot system has a family of products designed to take care of nearly all your backyard tasks, including a snow blower, lawn mower, granular spreader, liquid spreader, and more.\nThe best part is that they all work with the same power docking station for a seamless experience. Many of the solutions are already available for purchase online, with newer models available for pre-order.\nAlso: The best robot lawn mowers\n5. Wim\nThe Wim first caught my attention because I had never seen an apparatus like it. Upon learning more, I realized that the technology was as innovative as it looked. The product is meant to assist in walking and exercising in a safe and efficient manner by providing the proper support.\nIt also includes personalized AI coaching that can help enhance your exercise experience by adjusting the intensity and timing and providing customized programs. The insights can also help with non-exercise coaching, such as improving walking performance. This could be especially helpful for people recovering from injuries or those with mobility challenges. When I tried it on, I was surprised to see how natural it felt and how unobstructed my walking was.\nThe product -- from South Korea's\u00a0WIRobotics\u00a0-- was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Accessibility & Aging Tech, Robotics category.\nSales for the product will begin in February, and I was not informed about pricing.\n6. Holobox\nThe Holobox makes hologram communication, which was typically limited to sci-fi movies, a reality. The box, which resembles a telephone booth, can display a real-life hologram of the person you are talking to, as long as they are in front of a white, well-lit background. They can communicate with you in nearly no latency, and even if you aren't in front of a white background yourself, the other call participant can still see you via monitor like a standard Zoom call instead of a hologram.\nYou can click here for a snippet of my experience, where I got to chat with the hologram of Holoconnects' CEO, Andre Smith.\nAlthough the technology seems complicated, it is a \"plug and play\" system, requiring only an outlet and the internet to function. The company also offers a desktop version, fittingly called the Holobox Mini. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\n7. Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo robot + stick vacuum\nOne of the most popular and practical robots is the robot vacuum. But a popular complaint about them is that no matter how efficient they are, they can often miss certain corners or nooks of your living space. Ecovocs addresses that issue by including a stick vacuum with its robot vacuum.\nThe charging station for the actual robot vacuum holds a concealed stick vacuum, which you can assemble to form a Matter-certified wireless stick vacuum with 8000Pa of suction. Now, if your robot misses something, getting to it yourself is easier.\nThe vacuum will be available at the end of March for $1,599.\n8. Nimble Beauty\nThe PR person delivering the demonstration called this AI-powered manicure device \"a Nespresso machine for manicures,\" and that title could not be more fitting. In the same way that a Nespresso machine can deliver barista-quality coffee to your home at the touch of a button, the Nimble Beauty device can act as an at-home nail salon. All you have to do is insert your hand and click a button, and the machine will do the rest using AI.\nI demo-ed the technology, and was the manicure perfect? No. But was it better than when I painted my right hand with my non-dominant left hand? Absolutely. The best part, in my opinion, is the convenience of not having to leave the house to get your nails done or worry about booking an appointment. Another benefit is that it has a fan that dries your nails between coats, so you don't have to worry about smudging them.\nThe device was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category.\nThe machine is available for preorder and costs $599 for the machine and $10 per nail polish capsule. Shipping begins in March.\n9. Ballie\nBallie, the circular household assistant robot, isn't new to Samsung\u00a0 -- it first launched in 2020. However, at this year's CES, Samsung showcased a revamped Ballie with new capabilities and AI features. The robot can now do everything from projecting video to managing home appliances.\nHaving watched the Samsung demo in person, I must say that I am not only impressed but would welcome the cute little basketball-looking robot into my home. Ballie was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nSamsung didn't disclose when it will be available or how much it will cost.\n10. Moonbird\nAs soon as I saw a sign that said that this device could reduce stress, I had to stop by the booth. The device, which fits in the palm of your hand comfortably, can help you reduce stress and anxiety by coaching you to breathe properly.\nThe device expands in your hands when you are supposed to breathe in and contracts when you are supposed to breathe out. This breathing exercise helps you slow down your breathing and concentrate on the act, which should, in turn, balance your autonomic nervous system. The device also has a sensor where you place your thumb to monitor certain metrics such as heart rate.\nThe device is available for purchase in four colors for $199.\n11. Anura MagicMirror\nAlthough this looks like an ordinary tabletop mirror, the Anura MagicMirror can do more than just show you your reflection. With a 30-second face scan, the mirror can gather your health data, such as heart rate and blood pressure.\nI got to demo the technology at CES, and it's as easy and intuitive to use as it sounds. The mirror was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Digital Health category.\nAlthough it seems like a fun gadget to have in your home, the PR team informed me that the intended audience is B2B such as doctors' offices or gyms.\n12. Nobi Smart Lamp\nNobi's smart lamps can ensure your older loved ones stay safe by doubling as fall detectors. The lamps use AI to detect when a person has fallen. After it detects the fall, it will notify designated emergency contacts, who can then talk to the fallen individual via the lamp, and even see the position the person is lying in.\nAt CES, the company announced the introduction into the US market, as well as the Nobi Ceiling, which is a ceiling version of its smart pendant lamp. From seeing it in person, I was amazed at how much like a regular lamp it looked.\n13. Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite\nIf you have read any of my CES roundups, you probably picked up on the fact that I love dogs. The Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is a device I am particularly excited about because it has the potential to improve the quality of dogs' lives significantly, and what could be better than that?\nThe Smart Tracker is placed on your dog's collar to track its behavior throughout the entire day. Then, based on your dog's activity levels and sleep, it lets you know the exact amount of food you should be feeding your dog for breakfast and dinner. The bowl has a button that will light up green when you have fed the proper amount or red when it's over or under, eliminating the need for measuring cups.\nI personally have met so many overweight dogs who could use losing some pounds, and this device eliminates the guesswork, helping the parents feed them the perfect amount and allowing them to get to an ideal lifestyle soon.\nAlthough it just launched at CES, the Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is available for purchase at $250, which includes the smart tracker, the hub, and the bowl.\n14. Rabbit R1\nIf you have ever wanted an AI assistant that can just do things for you without the need for lengthy and detailed prompts, the Rabbit might be the device for you. The pocket-sized Rabbit leverages AI to act as a personal assistant that can use apps for you.\nAlso: This AI startup made a $199 gadget that replaces apps with 'rabbits' - and it might just work\nEssentially, the R1 would eliminate having to scramble to find the right app on your phone, and then following through to complete the action you need. Instead, with the device, you can have some \"rabbits\" complete the task for you from start to finish simply by telling it what end-result you want done.\nThe device is $199 and is available for preorder.\nRelated\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nAI will unleash the next level of human potential.

        "raw_content": "News\nFinance\nSports\nEntertainment\nLife\nRobots are dominating at CES 2024 \u2014 these are the 9 best so far\nCES 2024 has been all about artificial intelligence, but one other trending technology has been giving AI a run for its money \u2014 robotics.\nWe\u2019ve seen home helpers that can watch your pets, lawnmowers that can customize cutting patterns and a delivery robot that can climb stairs.\nThere have been enough robot vacuum cleaners, mops and home appliances to get Skynet excited for the start of the rebellion, and you\u2019d be hard-pressed to find anything without AI.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nThe best robots at CES 2024\nTo get an idea of just how widespread the robot invasion of our homes, gardens and workspaces has become I\u2019ve pulled together a list of the 9 best robotic announcements so far at CES 2024.\n1. Ballie projects itself into your heart\nBefore CES even began Samsung declared it was all-in on AI. This includes using vision models to tell you what food to make based on the contents of your fridge, launching new large language models for its cellphones and bringing smart robots to your home.\nBallie is part entertainment device, part chatbot and part home assistant. The round robot can project things onto the floor, wall or ceiling as it follows you around the home like a lost puppy.\nThe yellow bot can also message its owner to give an update on the pets, manage smart tech in the home and even answer calls on your behalf.\nThe problem is right now it's nothing more than a video. When the first version of Ballie was unveiled in 2020 a model was whizzing around the stage. This year we\u2019ve only seen it in a video, with no details on price, launch or availability.\n2. LG smart home agent\nYou wait all day for a bus then two come along at once. Or in this case, you don\u2019t wait for a tiny, cute robot that can link up with your home appliances but two still come along at once.\nNot to be outdone by Samsung, LG revealed its smart home agent. An AI-packed little bot on two legs that rolls around your home keeping an eye on your smart tech, pets and you.\nLG\u2019s little agent is basically a smart hub that can move about. It has a built-in large language model voice assistant so you can communicate with it in much the same way you can with ChatGPT voice and it can monitor your mood.\nConnected through the LG smart home platform ThinQ, it can manage washers, ovens and even refrigerators unaided. It uses machine learning to understand how the family interacts and uses devices and can perform voice and facial analysis. Like Bailee it has no price, release data or physical model to try out.\n3. Rise of the lawnbot \u2014 Segway Navimow\nRobot lawnmowers aren't a new idea. They've been around about as long as the robot vacuum with new models and companies rising and falling.\nThis year at CES we've seen a multitude of mowers, blowers and other gardening aids and one of the highlights is the Segway Navimow.\nThe Navimow H Series has been available in Europe for some time but is now coming to the U.S. for the first time. It uses AI vision technology and GPS positioning to navigate around even the most tricky yard and uses a small base station when GPS isn't available.\nThe H Series range features a BladeHalt sensor, a Rain sensor, an Ultrasonic sensor (H3000), and a VisionFence sensor (H3000), so it should be able to more easily detect and avoid objects on your lawn.\nPricing has not yet been made available for the U.S. market, but when it was released in Europe, the H500E was priced at \u20ac1,199 (about $1,300), the H800 was at \u20ac1,499, and the H3000E cost \u20ac2,499 (about $2,700).\n4. Oro is a buddy for your pets\nBoth Samsung's Ballie and the LG smart home agent boast pet-sitting capabilities, but the adorable big-eyed ORo from Ogmen Robotics goes a step further, being designed as a ball-throwing, food-delivering pet buddy.\nThe autonomous robot can take care of your dog when you're not at home. Priced at $799 and available from April it is fitted way a suit of sensors, two-way audio and an interactive video screen that lets you chat to your canine from anywhere.\nORo can also capture images and videos of your pet at play that you can then share online or keep to look back on. it also has a built-in food dispenser that can launch nibbles at your good boy and a separate automatic food bowl that the bot can control.\nOne of the most impressive features is its built-in AI that learns by watching the way your pet plays. It understands its behavior patterns and can play music or throw a ball when Rover becomes agitated or restless.\nORo is currently available for pre-order with a $299 downpayment with the remaining $500 due when it is ready to ship. It comes in cozy carbon and ivory mist. The price includes hte base-station, the dog bowl and the robot.\n5. Climbing up the stairs \u2014 MOBINN from RcLab\nThe MOBINN is a delivery robot with flexible wheels that allow it to drive on even ground and climb stairs while bringing you that parcel you need urgently.\nIt is a research example at the moment without a date for release or a price but it can maintain a constant and steady horizon for the main body ensuring the Starbucks you ordered doesn't spill on its way from the coffee shop down the street.\nThe M3 has a LiDAR-based mapping system to allow it to operate regardless of the terrain and can also work in rain, snow and at night.\n6. The Loona companion bot\nSometimes all you need to cheer you up is a pet but that isn't always practical. Enter Loona, the companion robot that uses ChatGPT to provide natural conversation with its owner.\nBuilt by Beijing KEYi Technology, the toy can play a range of interactive games, is a moveable home monitor and acts as a programming learning platform.\nThe cute little bot also includes gesture recognition technology, voice commands and graphic programming to allow users to create their own instructions.\nThe base model is $380 with a range of accessories and add-ons available including coding kits, game prop kits and a charging dock.\n7. Robot vacuum phone home\nRobot vacuum maker Roborock has a new flagship vacuum and mp called the S8 MaxV Ultra that includes a voice assistant, robot arm and video calling functionality.\nLaunching at CES 2024, the S8 MaxV can be controlled without the need for another device \u2014 just speak to it and tell it what to clean.\nThe built-in camera allows for AI-powered obstacle avoidance in addition to the ability to call its owner or have the owner call in remotely.\n6. Elderly companion robot\nIntuition Robotics is bringing generative AI to its elderly care companion robot ElliQ. The third generation of the bot, known as the ElliQ 3 uses AI to offer more engaging and two-way conversations for its users.\nSmaller and lighter than previous versions it also includes a screen fully integrated into the device rather than as a standalone tool.\nA built-in AI processing unit and a RAM increase also makes it easier to use and interact with as it can handle natural language conversations.\nIt also uses generative AI to better utilize information the user shares with the device such as favorite color, pet and religion. It can reference this information in conversations and choose activities based on user interests.\n7. A coffee making robot\nADAM is a robot barista from Richtech Robotics. Impressing at CES 2024 it can make hot or cold coffee with 21 unique menu offerings. It can also turn its hand to cold brew and Boba or mix up a cocktail.\nThe two-armed robot can interact with customers to take their order through a natural language interface, use its arms to make the drink and even wash up.\nEach arm can work independently to create two drinks at the same time and can be customized with different phrases depending on the use case or company.\nADAM is only available as a rental device for specific events. So far it is the main barista in a Manhattan coffee shop, served Boba at Cloutea on the Las Vegas strip and served drinks for Kendall Jenner at hte launch of her 818 Tequila signature bottle launch party.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nAI at CES 2024: Biggest announcements so far\nChatGPT in cars and grills with AI\nAlmost every announcement, keynote, and product at CES 2024 so far has included some type of update on of artificial intelligence.\u00a0From LG\u2019s robot butler to a grill that uses AI to improve cooking time and quality, the technology of the day is everywhere.\nIn some cases, AI is just a part of a bigger product, like using vision technology in a robot vacuum to improve object avoidance.\u00a0Elsewhere it is the entire announcement, such as Samsung going \u201call in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its product range.\nPart of this is so companies can capitalize on the hype surrounding AI, which anecdotally makes it easier to get funding. The bigger part is that the technology has matured to a point where it brings significant improvements in some areas.\nWhat has been announced around AI at CES 2024\nTo better break down the hype and find the real gems I\u2019ve pulled together some of the biggest announcements in the AI space at CES 2024.\nLG unveils smart home robot\nLG kicked off its CES showcase with a new robot that promises to turn your smart home into a \u201cZero Labor Home.\u201d\u00a0This AI-powered butler bot can organize your smart devices and even keep an eye on your pets when you\u2019re not home.\nThe admittedly cute LG robot is about a foot tall and moves on two legs, allowing it to patrol your home for potential issues, and even read your emotions to ensure it gives you a better overall at-home experience.\nThanks to the inclusion of Qualcomm\u2019s Robotics RB5 Platform, LG's robot uses AI to learn your interests and behaviors and get better over time at serving as a friendly home companion.\nSamsung declares \u201cAI for all\u201d at CES\nSamsung has been pushing the AI in everything narrative since last year and its keynote at CES \u2014 dubbed \"AI for all\" \u2014 turned out to be no different. The company makes everything from smartphones to home appliances and AI will be incorporated across the full range of products.\nWe've already seen details of refrigerators with cameras and AI vision technology. This allows the device to recommend recipes based on what it can see in the fridge. The company has also unveiled televisions with AI built in that can scale content to improve resolution and enhance the depth perception of an image. And there are also robot mops and vacuums that use AI to seek out stains.\nSamsung's biggest AI announcement may be yet to come. Next week, the company hosts Galaxy Unpacked, where it's expected to introduce the new Galaxy S24 lineup of smartphones. Samsung has already made it very clear that AI will play a central role with its next flagship devices.\nNvidia expands AI dominance\nDespite a near dominance in AI hardware for the past year, Nvidia isn't resting on its laurels. This is likely due to increased competition from Intel, AMD and Qualcomm in chips capable of running and training models.\nThe company unveiled the GeForce RTX series of desktop graphics cards that, while specifically aimed at the gaming sector, also have a \u201cready for AI\u201d feel.\nNot to be left out, AMD also unveiled its new Hawk Line CPUs complete with AI technology.\nMost of the AI is delivered through software capable of seamlessly offloading certain tasks to the neural processing units inside the new series of chipsets.\nAI coming to a car near you\nVolkswagen was one of a number of car companies announcing wider use of artificial intelligence as part of its in-car entertainment system.\nThe German carmaker is bringing OpenAI's ChatGPT to its vehicles, integrated into its existing IDA voice assistant to give it a more natural conversation style and ability to complete more complex requests\nAlso in the vehicle space, Bosch launched a pair of new AI-powered technologies at CES. The eye-tracking technology can see whether you are looking drowsy when you are driving, ask if you need a coffee when you get home and program your coffee machine to have a drink ready when you walk through the door.\nThe other eye-tracking tech from Bosch could be used while driving to determine what you're looking at and other information about the street sign, building or object. This could even include tell you the opening times of a nearby store or restaurant.\nCooking and cleaning with AI\nOne of the hottest tickets at AI is a smart grill that can reach a staggering 1,652\u00b0 F and cook the perfect ribeye steak in 90 seconds.\nSeergrills says\u00a0that its Perfecta grill uses a powerful quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure aspects of the food and environment, including thickness and temperature. This lets you control the cook and get perfect results every time.\nTo clean up the messes made from eating all that grilled food you need a mop or vacuum. Roborock's latest device uses AI to let it detect obstacles, find complex stains and even call home when it has an issue.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "The best robot vacuums unveiled at CES 2024 go where Roombas still haven't\nThe robot vacuums unveiled at CES 2024 are ushering in a new era of automated at-home cleaning. And none of them are Roombas.\nLike Apple, iRobot doesn't do CES. Rather, the latest Roombas arrived in September 2023 and had a peaceful few months of (basically) being the best in the business. That's changing with the 2024 fleet of new flagship models from brands like Roborock, Samsung, Ecovacs, and Eufy, all of which showcased serious upgrades to their previous robot vacuums.\nWe're seeing a few recurring glow-ups that are setting new standards for ways a robot vacuum can make your life easier: Small obstacle avoidance (think phone chargers, socks, and pet waste) is non-negotiable at this point, but fully self-sufficient mopping \u2014 real elbow grease, AI-fueled stain detection, and automated washing and drying of mopping pads \u2014\u00a0is the clear theme of the year. Even the most advanced Roomba doesn't offer those last two bullet points.\nBelow, we're diving into the details of our favorite 2024 competitors, as well as hashing out the differences between the new models and their predecessors. We'll also give pricing and release date information if we have it.\nRoborock S8 Max Ultra, and S8 MaxV Ultra\nIt feels like just yesterday (was October not last month?) that Roborock dropped its last bots of 2023, the Q5 Pro and Q8 Max series. However, Roborock operates on both its release schedule and the CES schedule, and there are yet again new Roborocks.\nThe more premium vacs of the two new series are the S8 Max Ultra, and S8 MaxV Ultra. This series' main claim to fame is a bendy robotic arm that extends from the underside of the vacuum to detail spots that a side brush would miss \u2014\u00a0a longstanding blind spot of even the most powerful robot vacuums.\nA front-facing camera is also on board, which guides more meticulous small obstacle and stain detection and can livestream footage as it roves \u2014 technically giving you the ability to talk to someone who's at home by talking through the app.\nSmarts aside, we'd be remiss not to mention the enhanced suction power on these bad boys: the Max Ultra clocks 8,000 Pa while the S8 MaxV Ultra clocks a whopping 10,000 Pa \u2014\u00a0doubling the power of so many vacs on the current market that were previously thought to be pretty damn powerful.\nLike the S8 Pro Ultra, which was unveiled at last year's CES, the S8 Max Ultra and MaxV Ultra docks wash mop heads and dry them with warm air, then refill the water tank in the bot itself. If you'd prefer to also not be responsible for manually refilling the larger water tank in the dock itself, there is a version of both new S8s that can be hooked up directly to your home's drainage system.\nStarting in April 2024, the Roborock S8 Max Ultra will be available for $1,599.99 and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra will be available for $1,799.99.\nRoborock Q Revo Pro and Q Revo MaxV\nThe more affordable new series is the Q Revo line, with both the Revo Pro and Revo MaxV sticking close to the $1,000 price point. (The latter is more expensive due to the presence of a built-in voice assistant.)\nAside from aesthetic differences of the docks, the main difference from the S8 line is the Q Revo's focus on more detailed mopping than sheer suction power. It mops with two oscillating mopping pads spinning at 200 RPM (rather than the S8's singular pad) for a closer clean around obstacles like table legs.\nCompared to the S8 series, the new Revo models clean with 7,000 Pa of suction instead of 10,000 \u2014\u00a0still impressive \u2014\u00a0and are equipped with the same FlexiArm design to reach into corners. They also wash and dry the mopping pads.\nThe Q Revo Pro will go for $999.99 and the Q Revo MaxV will go for $1,199.99 when they become available for purchase in April 2024.\nEcovacs X2 Combo\nSpeaking of corner cleaning, Ecovacs is once again taking the literal route with another square robot vacuum \u2014\u00a0its second released in three months. After the Sept. 2023 drop of the Ecovacs Deebot X2 Omni (a welcomed upgrade over the frustrating Deebot X1 Omni) Ecovacs has already found a unique way to build on its most advanced robot vacuum: adding a handheld vacuum to the ensemble.\nYes, \"Combo\" refers to a new docking station that charges the robot vacuum itself on one side and a cordless handheld vacuum on the other side \u2014\u00a0because we all know that there are some intricate messes that you'd prefer to tackle by hand. Both vacuums self-empty into the bi-directional dustbin in the middle.\nOther features seen in the X2 Omni that have carried over to the X2 Combo include mopping, washing and drying of the mopping pads, automatic water tank refilling, AI obstacle avoidance, and a voice assistant called Yiko that you can use to beckon the vacuum to wherever you're standing. Unlike the X2 Omni, the Combo is also Matter-ready, meaning it's compatible with several smart home systems.\nThe Ecovacs X2 Combo will cost $1,599 upon release, which is TBA but likely in the spring.\nSamsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+\nSamsung's booth theme for CES 2024 \u2014 and the bigger theme for CES as a whole this year, apparently \u2014\u00a0is AI. More tangibly, Samsung's lean into AI is showcased in its new robot vacuum, the Bespoke Jet Combo AI+. Though it isn't Samsung's first robot vacuum with \"AI\" in the name, it does use AI in a major new way. On top of AI-powered smart mapping and AI-powered small obstacle detection, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ can also detect stains on hard floors without you having to designate a cleaning zone in the app.\nSo yes, Samsung's flagship robot vacuum finally mops. Once the Jet Bot finds a stain, the bot quickly returns to the dock to heat the mopping pads with hot enough water to create steam, then heads back to the problem spot to scrub, spinning at 170 RPM.\nIn line with the trend of fully automated mopping that we've been seeing, the Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ charges on a self-emptying dock that also auto-fills the Jet Bot's water tank and washes and dries the mop.\nPricing and a release date for the Samsung Bespoke Jet Bot Combo AI+ are still up in the air. Its predecessor, the Jet Bot AI+ that does not mop, debuted at $1,299.99 in 2021, so we expect the Combo AI+ to be slightly more expensive than that upon release.\nEufy X10 Pro Omni\nEufy's latest botvac doesn't necessarily do anything that we haven't seen before. It empties itself, mops with some elbow grease, washes and dries its mopping pads, and avoids obstacles like cords and socks. It's a solid checklist that's almost expected at this point in the game.\nWhat is groundbreaking about the X10 Pro Omni, though, is the fact that it secures all of those features for half the cost of multiple other vacuums in this list.\nWhile Ecovacs takes a break from using \"Omni\" in its robot vacuum names, Eufy's Omni era will undoubtedly change the game for the sub-$1,000 robot vacuum category. Despite debuting at a price point that's $100 less than its predecessor, the X9 Pro, the X10 Pro Omni dishes out significantly stronger suction power (8,000 Pa versus the X9 Pro's 5,500 Pa) and cleans with a new edge-hugging feature for better baseboard and corner attention. It's also square-ish with rounded edges.\nLike the X9 Pro, the X10 Pro Omni mops with dual spinning, pressurized mops that are fully lifted above carpeting and rugs when it's sensed. After mopping, the self-empty dock also washes and dries the mopping pads.\nThis packed checklist should cost way more than the mere $799.99 price that Eufy's asking, but we're not complaining. You can secure the X10 Pro Omni for yourself starting on Feb. 20.\nTopics\nCES\nRobot Vacuums\nLeah Stodart is a Philadelphia-based Senior Shopping Reporter at Mashable where she covers essential home tech like vacuums and TVs as well as sustainable swaps and travel.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Unveiling the Future of Home Robotics\nThe field of robotics has always fascinated us, and CES 2024 demonstrated that the intrigue surrounding these machines is far from over. From futuristic demos to functional prototypes, the event showcased the cutting-edge capabilities of home robots. While some may argue that these demos are merely a spectacle, they serve as a clear indication that big electronics firms are still committed to innovation and technological advancement. In this article, we will explore the reasons behind the slow progress of home robots, the potential breakthroughs on the horizon, and the current state of the industry.\nThe Evolution of Home Robotics\nThe Roomba Revolution\nWhen it comes to home robots, the first name that comes to mind is Roomba. The Roomba, introduced by iRobot in 2002, revolutionized the industry with its autonomous vacuuming capabilities. Despite numerous attempts by companies to create a better robot vacuum, the Roomba remains unmatched in functionality and popularity. Over the years, Roombas have become smarter, more efficient, and even capable of mopping. They have become a staple in many households, alleviating the burden of mundane chores.\nThe Quest for Security\nAnother area where home robots have shown promise is in the realm of security. The idea of having a mobile surveillance system that can navigate our homes has captured the imagination of many. Companies like Amazon have tried to tap into this market with products like Astro, a home robot with integrated security features. However, the high price point and limited functionality have hindered its widespread adoption. While security remains a potential application for home robots, there are still several challenges to overcome before they become a common sight in our households.\nMatic: A Step Forward\nAt CES 2024, Matic, a company specializing in home robotics, showcased a unique approach to the category. They have developed a home robotics platform that excels in vacuuming and mopping. Their system utilizes an array of cameras to map spaces and navigate efficiently. Matic\u2019s founders, backed by knowledgeable sources, have created a foundation for home robots that can potentially evolve into more advanced and versatile machines. By mastering the level 5 autonomy required for independent navigation, Matic opens doors to additional functionality and applications.\nThe Future of Home Robotics\nOvercoming Limitations\nOne of the key challenges in developing home robots is functionality. Most robots in the market are designed to perform a single specific task repeatedly. While the Roomba has dominated the robot vacuum space, the industry has struggled to expand beyond this narrow focus. The silver bullet for home robots lies in tackling chores that people dislike or find challenging. Tasks like mobile grasping, reaching high places, and traversing stairs are complex but necessary for a truly versatile home robot. Companies are exploring solutions by incorporating arms, legs, and even humanoid features into their designs.\nThe Rise of Humanoids\nHumanoids have long fascinated roboticists and researchers. The idea of having a robot that resembles a human and can navigate our homes intuitively is appealing. However, commercial general-purpose humanoid home robots are not expected to be available in the near future. The primary reasons for this are the high cost of development and the complexity of navigating unstructured home environments. While warehouses and factories offer a more structured environment for robots, our homes present a myriad of challenges that must be overcome before humanoid robots become a reality.\nThe Role of Generative AI\nGenerative AI, a technology that was prevalent at CES 2024, holds immense potential for the future of robotics. Learning and natural language processing are two areas where generative AI can significantly impact the capabilities of robots. By enabling robots to learn and adapt, and by facilitating seamless communication between humans and machines, generative AI can pave the way for general-purpose home robots. However, optimistic projections suggest that it may take at least five years before we see the full potential of generative AI in robotics.\nThe Age Tech Space: A Promising Market\nWhile we wait for the advent of general-purpose home robots, there is a growing market for age tech devices aimed at older individuals.
