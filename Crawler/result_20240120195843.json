        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Though AI was mainly represented in\u00a0chatbots\u00a0in the past year, companies are now finding more innovative ways to incorporate the technology into hardware, including everything from futuristic robots to laptops to products that would have never been possible before.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWith so many AI-related announcements at CES this year, it can be difficult to distinguish between what's simple AI-washing and what's actual visionary technology. To help you understand what's most important, I've created a roundup of the AI and robots that have distinguished themselves from the rest based on factors such as helpfulness, uniqueness, and real-world applications.\nWith two press days and two event days down, I have seen a majority of what CES has to offer, including A LOT of product demos. To find out what my top picks for the best AI-infused products at CES are, keep reading. Also, most of my picks also happen to have won CES 2024 Innovation Awards, showing just how good these devices are.\n1. Motion Pillow\nThe Motion Pillow uses AI to help tackle snoring problems and give you a better night's sleep. The AI Motion System detects a user's snoring and slowly inflates airbags to lift their head and open their airway to reduce it. The accompanying app tracks sleep data, including snoring time, airbag operation time, sleep score, sleep time, and even recordings of your snoring to play back later.\nTo build on the technology, the company also introduced an accompanying Motion Ring to monitor your sleep status in real time and send data to the motion system for a more seamless experience. The combination of the ring with the pillow, known as motionsleep, earned the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.\nThe Motion Pillow alone costs $699, but it's 40% off during the CES exhibition period, retailing at $420.\n2. Bmind Smart Mirror\nThe Bmind Smart Mirror claims to be the world's first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness, according to manufacturer Baracoda. Leveraging generative AI, the mirror can provide personalized recommendations, such as light therapy sessions, guided meditation, and self-affirmations based on your mental state, to help improve your mood and manage stress.\nWhen I demoed the mirror, it asked me how my day was, and for testing purposes, I said it went terribly. Immediately, the mirror said encouraging words to me, switched the lights to a calming blue color, displayed an image of nature, and encouraged me to start a meditation session.\nThe mirror was even recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Smart Home category.\n3. Minitailz Smart Dog Collar\nIf you are a dog mom like me, you're probably always thinking of ways you could make your pet's quality of life better. Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar is a fitness tracker for your dog, and can help you better understand what they need.\nThe tracker detects a dog's GPS location to ensure your fur baby never gets lost, along with health stats such as resting heart rate and breathing. The company claims that the collars can detect early signs of heart failure before the onset of symptoms. The collar also offers AI-driven activity detection with real-time alerts that can let the pert owner know exactly what their pet is doing.\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category.\nIf you are interested, the Minitailz collar is available for $99. However, there is also a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\n4. Yarbo Multi-Purpose Intelligent Yard Robot\nTaking care of your yard can be a hassle, with the grass alone requiring cutting, fertilizing, and watering. The Yarbo multi-purpose yard robot system has a family of products designed to take care of nearly all your backyard tasks, including a snow blower, lawn mower, granular spreader, liquid spreader, and more.\nThe best part is that they all work with the same power docking station for a seamless experience. Many of the solutions are already available for purchase online, with newer models available for pre-order.\nAlso: The best robot lawn mowers\n5. Wim\nThe Wim first caught my attention because I had never seen an apparatus like it. Upon learning more, I realized that the technology was as innovative as it looked. The product is meant to assist in walking and exercising in a safe and efficient manner by providing the proper support.\nIt also includes personalized AI coaching that can help enhance your exercise experience by adjusting the intensity and timing and providing customized programs. The insights can also help with non-exercise coaching, such as improving walking performance. This could be especially helpful for people recovering from injuries or those with mobility challenges. When I tried it on, I was surprised to see how natural it felt and how unobstructed my walking was.\nThe product -- from South Korea's\u00a0WIRobotics\u00a0-- was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Accessibility & Aging Tech, Robotics category.\nSales for the product will begin in February, and I was not informed about pricing.\n6. Holobox\nThe Holobox makes hologram communication, which was typically limited to sci-fi movies, a reality. The box, which resembles a telephone booth, can display a real-life hologram of the person you are talking to, as long as they are in front of a white, well-lit background. They can communicate with you in nearly no latency, and even if you aren't in front of a white background yourself, the other call participant can still see you via monitor like a standard Zoom call instead of a hologram.\nYou can click here for a snippet of my experience, where I got to chat with the hologram of Holoconnects' CEO, Andre Smith.\nAlthough the technology seems complicated, it is a \"plug and play\" system, requiring only an outlet and the internet to function. The company also offers a desktop version, fittingly called the Holobox Mini. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\n7. Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo robot + stick vacuum\nOne of the most popular and practical robots is the robot vacuum. But a popular complaint about them is that no matter how efficient they are, they can often miss certain corners or nooks of your living space. Ecovocs addresses that issue by including a stick vacuum with its robot vacuum.\nThe charging station for the actual robot vacuum holds a concealed stick vacuum, which you can assemble to form a Matter-certified wireless stick vacuum with 8000Pa of suction. Now, if your robot misses something, getting to it yourself is easier.\nThe vacuum will be available at the end of March for $1,599.\n8. Nimble Beauty\nThe PR person delivering the demonstration called this AI-powered manicure device \"a Nespresso machine for manicures,\" and that title could not be more fitting. In the same way that a Nespresso machine can deliver barista-quality coffee to your home at the touch of a button, the Nimble Beauty device can act as an at-home nail salon. All you have to do is insert your hand and click a button, and the machine will do the rest using AI.\nI demo-ed the technology, and was the manicure perfect? No. But was it better than when I painted my right hand with my non-dominant left hand? Absolutely. The best part, in my opinion, is the convenience of not having to leave the house to get your nails done or worry about booking an appointment. Another benefit is that it has a fan that dries your nails between coats, so you don't have to worry about smudging them.\nThe device was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category.\nThe machine is available for preorder and costs $599 for the machine and $10 per nail polish capsule. Shipping begins in March.\n9. Ballie\nBallie, the circular household assistant robot, isn't new to Samsung\u00a0 -- it first launched in 2020. However, at this year's CES, Samsung showcased a revamped Ballie with new capabilities and AI features. The robot can now do everything from projecting video to managing home appliances.\nHaving watched the Samsung demo in person, I must say that I am not only impressed but would welcome the cute little basketball-looking robot into my home. Ballie was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nSamsung didn't disclose when it will be available or how much it will cost.\n10. Moonbird\nAs soon as I saw a sign that said that this device could reduce stress, I had to stop by the booth. The device, which fits in the palm of your hand comfortably, can help you reduce stress and anxiety by coaching you to breathe properly.\nThe device expands in your hands when you are supposed to breathe in and contracts when you are supposed to breathe out. This breathing exercise helps you slow down your breathing and concentrate on the act, which should, in turn, balance your autonomic nervous system. The device also has a sensor where you place your thumb to monitor certain metrics such as heart rate.\nThe device is available for purchase in four colors for $199.\n11. Anura MagicMirror\nAlthough this looks like an ordinary tabletop mirror, the Anura MagicMirror can do more than just show you your reflection. With a 30-second face scan, the mirror can gather your health data, such as heart rate and blood pressure.\nI got to demo the technology at CES, and it's as easy and intuitive to use as it sounds. The mirror was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Digital Health category.\nAlthough it seems like a fun gadget to have in your home, the PR team informed me that the intended audience is B2B such as doctors' offices or gyms.\n12. Nobi Smart Lamp\nNobi's smart lamps can ensure your older loved ones stay safe by doubling as fall detectors. The lamps use AI to detect when a person has fallen. After it detects the fall, it will notify designated emergency contacts, who can then talk to the fallen individual via the lamp, and even see the position the person is lying in.\nAt CES, the company announced the introduction into the US market, as well as the Nobi Ceiling, which is a ceiling version of its smart pendant lamp. From seeing it in person, I was amazed at how much like a regular lamp it looked.\n13. Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite\nIf you have read any of my CES roundups, you probably picked up on the fact that I love dogs. The Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is a device I am particularly excited about because it has the potential to improve the quality of dogs' lives significantly, and what could be better than that?\nThe Smart Tracker is placed on your dog's collar to track its behavior throughout the entire day. Then, based on your dog's activity levels and sleep, it lets you know the exact amount of food you should be feeding your dog for breakfast and dinner. The bowl has a button that will light up green when you have fed the proper amount or red when it's over or under, eliminating the need for measuring cups.\nI personally have met so many overweight dogs who could use losing some pounds, and this device eliminates the guesswork, helping the parents feed them the perfect amount and allowing them to get to an ideal lifestyle soon.\nAlthough it just launched at CES, the Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is available for purchase at $250, which includes the smart tracker, the hub, and the bowl.\n14. Rabbit R1\nIf you have ever wanted an AI assistant that can just do things for you without the need for lengthy and detailed prompts, the Rabbit might be the device for you. The pocket-sized Rabbit leverages AI to act as a personal assistant that can use apps for you.\nAlso: This AI startup made a $199 gadget that replaces apps with 'rabbits' - and it might just work\nEssentially, the R1 would eliminate having to scramble to find the right app on your phone, and then following through to complete the action you need. Instead, with the device, you can have some \"rabbits\" complete the task for you from start to finish simply by telling it what end-result you want done.\nThe device is $199 and is available for preorder.\nRelated\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nAI will unleash the next level of human potential.

        "raw_content": "Big Chinese companies brighten 2024 CES\nChinese technology companies have made a prominent comeback at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nAt the world's premier tech show in Las Vegas in the United States, they are showcasing their latest achievements in cutting-edge technologies. These range from artificial intelligence, next-generation semiconductor display, autonomous driving, robots to augmented reality.\nHighlighting that China is playing an increasingly vital role in bolstering technological innovation, experts said intelligent devices powered by generative AI and the internet of things are expected to become a key growth driver for global consumer electronics industry.\nAccording to the US Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, more than 4,000 enterprises from across the globe are participating in the CES, which opened on Tuesday and will conclude on Friday. Of these, 1,114 are from China and 1,201 are based in the US.\nAI-powered terminal devices are attracting attention this year amid a worldwide frenzy over the ChatGPT chatbot. Chinese consumer electronics maker TCL demonstrated over 120 pieces of intelligent hardware covering quantum dot mini-LED TVs, AI processing chips, smartphones, intelligent AR goggles and vehicle-mounted display products.\nThe company is accelerating efforts to expand presence in North America by boosting production capacity at its Mexican factory, given that building global competitiveness has always been important for TCL.\nHisense Group, a major Chinese home appliance manufacturer, unveiled its latest ultra light-emitting diode or ULED TV and laser display technology at the CES.\nDavid Gold, vice-president of Hisense International, said at a product launch event that display technology is widely applied in sports, education and medical fields, continuously pushing technological boundaries.\nLenovo Group Ltd, the world's largest personal computer maker, unveiled a full lineup of more than 40 new devices and solutions powered by AI at the CES. It said it believes this year will mark the advent of AI-based PCs.\nXpeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's Xpeng Motors, showcased its pilotless flying car, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft at the CES.\n\"Chinese tech companies are at the forefront of technological innovation globally, and actively promoting the application of AI in consumer electronics, intelligent devices and electric vehicles,\" said Hong Yong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe latest technological breakthroughs made by Chinese companies in the fields of virtual reality and autonomous driving also reflect their strengths and innovative capabilities in crucial technologies, which will be conducive to industrial upgrades and boosting their own competitiveness on the global stage, Hong said.\nChinese augmented reality company Xreal showcased its latest AR-enabled innovative products by partnering with companies such as Qualcomm and BMW.\nCES attendees can join a Las Vegas tour hosted by BMW, where they will have the opportunity to experience Xreal's AR glasses along the way. They can witness how in-car information, including navigation cues, hazard warnings, entertainment content and charging station details seamlessly integrate into the real environment through Xreal Air 2 glasses.\nJin Peng, co-founder of Xreal, said, \"In the future world, whether it's in offices or entertainment, for mobile commuting or personal enjoyment, people will engage in work and experience life in new and creative ways.\"\nChinese tech companies have shown the potential to lead the industry not only in mature categories such as smartphones, but also in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence of things, AR and VR, said Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center at Zhejiang University's International Business School.\nContact the writers at fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn\nCopyright 1995 -\n.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

The show officially starts on Tuesday, but at a media event on Sunday night, the tech press who have gathered here in Las Vegas to cover CES got to peek at some of the gadgets launching later this week. Here\u2019s a selection of some of the neatest things we\u2019ve seen so far.\nHorwin Senmenti 0\nThe Chinese EV company Horwin\u2014the name is a mashup of \u201chorizon\u201d and \u201cwin\u201d\u2014is moving into the US market in 2024 with a trio of urban-focused electric motorcycles. This one\u2014the chunkily styled Senmenti 0\u2014is the company\u2019s first model to go on sale here after claiming road space in Europe and Asia. It puts out 100 horsepower, has a top speed of 125 mph, and does zero to 60 in 2.8 seconds. The 16.9 kilowatt-hour battery gives the motorcycle a range of up to 186 miles, and it can plug into the same DC fast chargers that cars use. Fast charging takes the battery from zero to 80 percent in half an hour. It\u2019s a two-seater; pegs above the back wheel and a scoop at the back of the seat let a passenger ride along. Stateside buyers can preorder a Senmenti 0 for $16,800, and the company plans to deliver the bikes before the end of the year. There are two other Senmenti models coming soon: the long distance X and the high-performance 11. Those will be released in 2025 and 2026, respectively. \u2014Michael Calore\nNuraLogix Anura MagicMirror\nMost of us deal with a health care system that limits access to thorough health testing until something serious happens. So imagine sitting down in front of a mirror and, in less than a minute, learning you have an irregular heart rate or hypertension or a fever, and then being able to take that data straight to a doctor. NuraLogix hopes that becomes commonplace with its Anura MagicMirror. The mirror (which is basically a 21.5-inch tablet) uses a camera to detect the blood flow activity beneath the surface of your face\u2019s skin, then sends that reading through an algorithm to calculate 100-plus health parameters. It builds on the brand\u2019s existing Anura app that can read certain vital signs through your phone\u2019s camera. NuraLogix CEO Marzio Pozzuoli stressed that the camera is not using facial recognition and that only your blood-flow data is sent to the cloud for analysis, while the video the mirror captures stays local. Pozzuoli said he could see it becoming a home health care appliance eventually, but it will start out being installed in places like gyms, pharmacies, or clinic waiting rooms. He predicts that a few measurements will be approved by the US Food and Drug Administration this year, with more to follow. \u2014Medea Giordano\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nHL Mando Parkie\nFirst it was the self-checkout line, now it\u2019s \u2026 robot valets. HLmando, a South Korean automobile manufacturer, showed off an autonomous parking solution, aptly called Parkie, at CES. This flat and huge piece of tech looks like someone cast an Engorgio charm on a graphics card. If you\u2019re at a mall\u2019s parking garage, get out and summon these autonomous bots. Two of them will head over and slide underneath your car; legs will extend and slide around all the wheels. The bots lift the car slightly, then roll it to the nearest available parking spot. When you\u2019re ready to go home, summon the bots again and they\u2019ll go find your car and bring it to the designated area. It\u2019s a solution that\u2019ll work in most garages already without the need for any drastic changes to the infrastructure. The company expects it to be available in South Korea by the end of the year. Just don\u2019t toss your keys at the bots. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker\nSmoked meat can't be beat, but smokers require a lot of space and a lot of fuss. A pellet grill, kamado, or dedicated smoker has to sit in a spot (like in the backyard) where it can huff and puff for hours without bothering bystanders. That's the old way. GE has a new way to smoke. This device is the GE Profile Smart Indoor Smoker. It's a countertop device about half the size of a mini fridge. Place your meats, veggies, salt, or whatever you're smoking on the racks in the main chamber, then pour your wood pellets into a hopper in the top. The smoke that fills the main chamber and comes in contact with your food is filtered before being ejected, so all that comes out is a hot breeze. You can use the smoker in your kitchen without worry, and it uses the same pellets you'd put in your grill. Control it with a companion mobile app, and use the preprogrammed routines for smoking common comestibles like chicken wings, brisket, and ribs. The smoker is already available for $999, so you can buy one now and enjoy a smokin' Super Bowl Sunday. \u2014Michael Calore\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nWithings BeamO\nHave you ever taken time off work to go into the doctor for your routine checkup and found out that \u2026 yes, you were fine? The Withings BeamO checks your vital signs quickly with a small, convenient, handheld device that's not much bigger than a television remote. The BeamO works as an electrocardiogram monitor, an oximeter, a stethoscope, and a thermometer. To measure SpO2 and to take a medical-grade ECG, place two fingers\u2014one from each hand\u2014on two electrodes. Meanwhile, a light simultaneously measures your blood oxygen levels. Place the BeamO on your chest over your heart or lungs to listen; you can also use it over a shirt or plug in a pair of headphones to monitor what it\u2019s picking up. Finally, to check your temperature, swipe it toward the center of your forehead from the temple. You can check its data readings in Withings\u2019 app, or export a report as a PDF to send to your doctor. The device is currently awaiting FDA clearance, but Withings expects to be selling it to consumers for $250 by the middle of this year. \u2014Adrienne So\nPalmplug\nGesture control devices are useful for a wide variety of applications. But while it\u2019s easy enough to use hand movements to simulate scrambling up a rock wall or paddling a canoe, it\u2019s a lot harder to use hand movements to learn how to do something that requires a high degree of fine motor control. The Palmplug, which aims to solve this, is a device that attaches sensors to the back of your hand and to each of your five fingers. High-fidelity motion capture lets you record and re-create nuanced or delicate hand gestures. Haptic feedback simulates a wide variety of textures and different nuanced vibrations, and the device also provides visual feedback in the form of multicolored LEDs. The range of applications for this technology is theoretically endless, but currently Palmplug offers devices that assist stroke patients who are rehabilitating, and that help students learn how to play musical instruments. In fact, the company founder and CEO Olaoluwa Adesanya was trying to learn how to play the saxophone and realized that his teacher also taught visually impaired kids to play by tapping their fingers. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nSkyted\nLet\u2019s say you\u2019re walking around Times Square and you have top secret information you need to convey over a phone call, but you\u2019re really paranoid about eavesdroppers. Well, you can either wait until you\u2019re somewhere secure, or turn into Bane. That second super subtle option is what the Skyted looks and feels like. This burly mask wraps around your mouth and seals off your voice to the outside world via sound-dampening material. I stood inches away from someone on the Skyted team as they spoke and I couldn\u2019t hear a single thing they was saying. It has a microphone on the inside and outside and the person on the other end of the call should be able to hear the speaker loud and clear, without any background noise. (It pairs wirelessly to a phone or connects via a wire.) The problem? The prototype they had on hand used a basic microphone, so the person wearing the mask really did sound like Bane and was tough to understand. The company tells me the final version will have much better quality mics that will make the wearer sound crystal clear. We\u2019ll have to wait and see if the Kickstarter, which launches today, will be successful first. If so, this mask will set you back a mouth-opening $299. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nSkwheel One\nThese electric skis from Skwheel (say it like \u201csqueal\u201d) can rocket along at up to 50 miles per hour, which we do not recommend trying in a crowded convention hall. The all-wheel drive skis also have thick, heavy, all-terrain wheels that are designed to be used everywhere from sandy beaches to asphalt to forest paths. Strap in wearing your street shoes (you have to have a shoe size above a European 36 and weigh under 240 pounds) and use a wireless remote like the kind used for electric skateboards to control your speed and braking. The removable lithium-ion battery lasts for a little over an hour and carries you about 30 kilometers, give or take, depending how much you weigh and how fast you go. In a world where snowfall is rapidly decreasing due to climate change, the ability to ski whenever and wherever you want might be a welcome evolution of the sport. \u2014Adrienne So\nRyan Waniata\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nJulian Chokkattu\nDoublepoint Technologies\nIt\u2019s so rare to hear about a third-party company developing software for Google\u2019s Wear OS smartwatch platform for Android phones, yet this very thing was spotted at CES. A company called Doublepoint Technologies has debuted a gesture-sensing app called Wow Mouse. It\u2019s available now for free on the Wear OS Google Play Store and it\u2019s compatible with most modern Wear OS smartwatches. It relies on the Inertial Measurement Units (IMU) sensor that\u2019s used in most fitness trackers and smartwatches to detect activity and lets you use a double-tap and a pinch and hold gesture with your fingers to control another device via Bluetooth. I saw the team using these gestures with a Samsung Galaxy Watch5 to control a browser just like they were using a mouse for input. They also used it as a controller in a mixed-reality headset and as a way to control the brightness of a connected lamp. Considering Apple is also going all-in on gesture controls in the Apple Vision Pro, it seems like the future will really rely on our hands as the input device. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nHurotics H-Fit\nAre you a college athlete struggling to shave seconds off your 200-meter time? Why train yourself to run faster via tedious and possibly ineffective interval training when you could wear a robot that trains your glutes to fire off faster and harder with every stride? That is the premise of the Hurotics H-Fit, an ergonomically designed assistive exoskeleton. In addition to mechanically forcing you to apply more force with each step, the suit also offers AI-enabled assistance to help you correct your form and optimize your training programs. It only costs a mere $25,000. If you fancy a different style of assistive exoskeleton, Hurotics also offers a much more moderately-priced version, the H-Flex, that's meant to be used for post-injury rehabilitation. \u2014Adrienne So\nJulian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nReece Rogers\nGear Team\nJeremy White\nMedea Giordano\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax promo code: 10% Off TurboTax Deluxe Edition (#1 Choice)\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\n1st Order: 25% Off DoorDash Promo Code ($15 minimum)\nTake $10 Off Your Order - Finish Line Coupon Code\nGroupon promo code: Extra 30% off any amount\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

Enrich Tomorrow.\u201d Under the three categories of \u201cSustainable Energy,\u201d \u201cCircular Economy,\u201d and \u201cResource Optimization,\u201d Panasonic will introduce concrete facts that will help the Group realize its vision of the lifestyle of the future. The latest products and solutions for enhancing each person\u2019s quality of life will also be exhibited.\nAs part of its long-term environmental vision, Panasonic GREEN IMPACT (https://holdings.panasonic/global/corporate/panasonic-green-impact.html) (PGI), Panasonic is taking an environmentally friendly approach to booth design. For example, Panasonic has incorporated joints made from high concentration cellulose fiber molding material \u201ckinari\u201d into its display tables; these tables will be used not only at CES, but at future exhibitions as well. Panasonic is also minimizing the use of building materials and carpeting.\nLive Streaming the Panasonic Press Conference\nThe Panasonic CES 2024 press conference (Monday, January 8, 2024, 10:00-10:45 PST) will be streamed online at https://panasonic.com/CES.\nMain Exhibits at LVCC:\nPanasonic Booth Overview\nCES Unveiled Las Vegas:\nShiftall Booth Overview\nPanasonic CES 2024 Press Kits:https://na.panasonic.com/us/ces\nMain Exhibition Booth Highlights:\nThe main presentation linked to the exhibition lineup will be shown in the theater at the entrance. Dioramas and representative examples will be placed in the center of each category to express Panasonic\u2019s vision for that segment.\nPanasonic GREEN IMPACT\nIntroduces \u201cPanasonic GREEN IMPACT,\u201d the Panasonic Group's commitment to achieving both a better life for people and a sustainable global environment. By reducing its carbon footprint, helping reduce emissions across society, and realizing a circular economy, the Group can ensure that its actions have impact.\nSustainable Energy\nBy promoting the diffusion of electrification from people\u2019s homes to society, Panasonic will create a zero-CO2 society that does not require fossil fuels and that uses only renewable energy for social activities. These products and solutions will be introduced using projection mapping dioramas.\nThe Panasonic Group will introduce a wide range of in-vehicle device solutions that contribute to the adoption of EVs. The exhibit will use lights and touch panels to intuitively show how Panasonic\u2019s products and technologies are used in various places throughout the car to solve environmental issues and contribute to the realization of a comfortable cabin while promoting safety and security.\nSince Panasonic\u2019s Air-to-Water Heat Pump collects and exchanges heat from ambient air; it is an environmentally friendly heating system that can reduce CO2 emissions compared to conventional combustion-type heating equipment that uses fossil fuels.\u00a0It is also possible to remotely monitor the operating status of the system, and the Group has established a system that can respond quickly in the event of a problem. Panasonic first brought its lineup to the European market in 2008, and in May 2023, became the first Japanese manufacturer to introduce products that use the environmentally friendly natural refrigerant, R290.\nPanasonic is developing high-performance electrodes for water electrolysis systems used in green hydrogen production.\u00a0These electrodes feature a high-activity catalyst material made of nickel-iron layered double hydroxide (Ni-Fe LDH), which achieves high performance without using precious metals. Utilizing electrodes makes it possible to significantly enhance the performance of contemporary water electrolysis systems and substantially reduce the production cost of green hydrogen.\nThis is a concept exhibit for the central air conditioning system proposed by Panasonic. Compared to standard whole-house air conditioning, which pumps in air every time the interior temperature changes, a central air conditioning system constantly circulates air at the preferred temperature, ensuring uniformity throughout the structure. Ventilation technology also helps to provide a comfortable and clean air environment.\nDERMS will leverage the latest IT capabilities to manage the generation and provision of locally sourced green energy to customers at their locations. It will also help counteract the inherent instability of renewable energy output by enhancing energy storage and delivery capabilities. Panasonic\u2019s DERMS solutions will contribute to accelerating the implementation of renewable energy across society. The exhibit will also use panels and videos to introduce Panasonic\u2019s efforts to ensure the safety of DERMS through monitoring and rapid detection of cyber-attacks.\u00a0For now, Panasonic is expanding verification with electric power companies and transportation companies to accelerate verification of business scaling.\nThis renewable energy solution uses 5 kW pure hydrogen fuel cell generators, which can be connected in networks of up to 250 units depending on power demand and location. This solution combines these generators with photovoltaic generators and storage batteries for highly integrated control of power generation, adding a storage battery system to manage power supply and demand in accordance with fluctuations in power demand and renewable energy output due to weather conditions. The company plans to start PoC demonstrations at Panasonic bases in the UK, Germany in FY2025.\nThis solution is the first in the industry to support simultaneous charging and discharging of EVs and storage batteries. Integration with AiSEG2 improves self-consumption of photovoltaic power. Features automatic charging of EVs and storage batteries based on weather warnings, and industry-leading self-sustaining output during power outages, to support a near-normal lifestyle.\nPanasonic aims to respond to customer needs by integrating solar power into unconventional spaces, such as windows and walls. PSCs represent a groundbreaking advancement in solar technology, offering a distinctive advantage in terms of their applicability.\u00a0Unique material and industrial inkjet coating technology enables the creation of glass-integrated solar cells, allowing for customizable and versatile designs with high conversion efficiency. Perovskite solar modules of practical size (>800 cm2) have the world\u2019s highest class conversion efficiency*1. With the potential to seamlessly incorporate solar power generation into glass structures, such as windows, walls, and facades, PSCs redefine the possibilities for renewable energy integration.\n*1: Certified by Panasonic and an independent third party\nCircular Economy\nMinimizing the use of resources, extending the life of products, and accelerating circular lifestyles with low environmental impact through systems and services that keep customers connected for a long time. Panasonic\u2019s future approach to consumer electronics manufacturing will be introduced through visual images.\nPanasonic is proceeding with initiatives to reduce the use of resin (plastic) based on the characteristics of individual products.\nWith the goal of contributing to the circular economy, this exhibit and video presentation will introduce the technologies that make refurbishing feasible. Applying manufacturing knowledge and expertise cultivated over many years, Panasonic has the technology to recycle used products and the knowledge to ensure quality through inspections and performance tests. In Japan, Panasonic are now verifying recycled products for some of its TVs and washing machines to reduce the number of products that are discarded due to defects occurring during delivery and installation, and to establish a product circulation scheme.\nPanasonic is building a system that closes the resource loop, from manufacturing to recycling to recycled resin, based on the concept of \u201cFrom Product to Product\u201d. By determining the characteristics of each recycled PP, PS, and ABS, the company has established techniques that use optimal formulations for resin parts, such as adding the group\u2019s own antioxidants and blending recycled resin with new resin materials. This enables reproduction at a level suitable for home appliances.\nResource Optimization\nPanasonic aims to reduce its global environmental impact and build a better relationship with the natural environment by optimizing the use of waste and carbon across the global organization.\nA newly developed photosynthetic microorganism transforms atmospheric CO2 into plant growth-promoting molecules that stimulate crop photosynthesis-related metabolisms and enhance yields. The photosynthesis-based CO2 transformation processes address the world's growing need for foodstuffs while taking a circular approach to carbon neutrality.\nDevelopment of moldable (pellet-like) materials made from natural fibers extracted from plant resources such as thinned wood and waste wood mixed with resin.Like conventional resins, it can be molded, colored, and processed, and is expected to find applications in a variety of products.\nReduce food waste by raising awareness of local foods and building a system that allows local residents to appreciate their \u201cgood value.\u201d In cooperation with local governments, the company will provide a food sharing service platform and subsidize the lending of kitchen waste disposal equipment to residents.\nEAT WELL\nThrough a food culture tailored to the needs and tastes of each individual, Panasonic will help people adopt a healthy lifestyle.\nAs one of the leading \u00a0microwave brands with Inverter technology, Panasonic is constantly striving to make it easier for families to eat well. Panasonic and Fresco will collaborate to deliver a revolutionary cooking assistant for Panasonic\u2019s multi-functional countertop ovens and will showcase this connected cooking experience in the booth.\nFEEL WELL\nThrough easy daily self-care, Panasonic will help keep bodies healthy.\nThe Panasonic EH-NA0J hair dryer, equipped with nanoe\u2122 MOISTURE+ and Mineral, provides moisture to the inside of the hair while mineral ions care for the cuticles, leading to a smooth finish that is resistant to damage. With continued use it can reduce friction damage from brushing, helping to achieve smooth and silky hair. This advanced technology, combined with its compact design, intelligent sensing, and various modes makes it an ideal tool for hair care.\nThe MULTISHAPE by Panasonic now delves into skincare and footcare with new attachments, offering exfoliating and cleansing brushes, in addition to a callus-removing footcare tool. Furthermore, Panasonic is also introducing new detail trimmer and hair clipper attachments. These new heads further expand the possibilities of the modular grooming system, which uses a single rechargeable base to reduce resource consumption by 60 percent. MULTISHAPE thus evolves into an all-encompassing, sustainable grooming device for diverse personal care routines.\nThe Panasonic ARC3 3-Blade Shaver, with inspiration drawn from the classic Star Wars\u2122 trilogy is packed with cutting-edge technology and a premium stormtrooper-inspired design that mimics the iconic armor of a Star Wars stormtrooper. The ES-SWLT2W includes three advanced Japanese stainless-steel blades that are designed for use on all types of beard hair to provide a close and comfortable shave, even with everyday use.\nIntroducing the Palm Shaver by Panasonic: a luxurious, palm-sized shaver which redefines the shaving experience with its 70% smaller design compared to traditional shavers. This innovative device incorporates Panasonic's advanced 5-blade system and sensing technology for a closer, more intuitive shave. The use of NAGORI\u00ae, a sustainable material from sea minerals, in its construction not only helps reduces plastic consumption but also provides a unique, ceramic-like experience.\nCONNECT WELL\nPanasonic will help make spaces more comfortable with video and audio technology.\nPanasonic's new flagship OLED TVs, Z95A and Z93A, come with Fire TV built in, offering a seamless blend of streaming, broadcast platforms, and smart home integration -- revolutionizing how you discover and enjoy content. The Z95A features a 65\" and 55\" Master OLED Ultimate panel module, while the Z93A offers a 77\" Master OLED Pro Cinema size, both powered by the new HCX Pro AI Processor MKII for enhanced picture clarity and color accuracy. These TVs also set new standards in gaming with a 144Hz refresh rate, specialized game modes, and compatibility with the latest gaming technologies, making them ideal for both entertainment and gaming enthusiasts.\nGo hard in your game. Not on your ears. Designed by gamers for gamers, the GNW10, from the SoundSlayer family of gaming audio products, delivers true-to-life sound that envelops you in the world of your games, music and cinema.\nMOVE WELL\nPanasonic Automotive unveils its collaboration with Infiniti to debut Klipsch Premier Audio System in the 2025 Infiniti QX80 Monograph to enhance audio luxury and performance.\nA demonstration of Panasonic Automotive\u2019s award-winning ELS STUDIO 3D\u00ae PREMIUM AUDIO reimagined for the Fisker Ocean One that blends best-in-class audio performance with sustainability-focused design. Neodymium magnet circuit designs are used to reduce the overall weight of each individual speaker by 30-60%. It is estimated that the ELS STUDIO 3D\u00ae PREMIUM AUDIO system draws up to 60% less energy than a typical audio system with similar acoustic output, which can potentially extend the vehicle driving range.\nLUMIX S 100 mm F2.8 MACRO is the world\u2019s smallest and lightest medium-telephoto fixed focal length macro lens*2. It is packed with Panasonic's cutting-edge technologies to achieve the exceptional compactness without any compromise in its performance.\n*2: As of January 8, 2024. Among interchangeable lenses for AF compatible full-frame mirrorless cameras, and macro lenses with a magnification ratio of 1:1 with a focal length of 90 mm or more.\nSL-1200GR2/SL-1210GR2 introduced in 1970 with the SP-10, Technics achieved a world first in turntable technology with its Direct Drive systems. Over more than half a century, this technology has continuously evolved, always striving for the pinnacle of analog record playback, honed with the latest advancements of each era.

        "raw_content": "Inside-Out Phones, Folding TVs: Behold The Eye-Popping Tech of CES 2024\nThe world's largest consumer tech show is a showcase of incredible innovation, and this is the cream of the crop.\nWe got an eyeful of a 137-inch TV that folds and unfolds, here at CES 2024.\nCES 2024\u00a0is full of innovative delights,\u00a0futuristic concepts, practical products you can\u00a0preorder or buy today\u00a0and some of the\u00a0strangest tech to stumble across our paths. Here in Las Vegas at the world's largest technology show, we're scouring the show floor for the best, most cutting-edge tech set to change our lives.\nAs we expected, AI is everywhere at CES this year, especially in the form of\u00a0ChatGPT and similar generative AI chatbots. We're also seeing plenty of TVs, phone goodies,\u00a0new car tech, gaming gear and robots\u00a0-- there's even a robot for your dog.\nHere's what's captivating us, and here are the biggest tech trends at CES this year. We'll bring you more news on the best tech highlights as we come across them this week in Las Vegas.\nRead more: \u00a0The Best of Show at CES 2024.\nAR/VR glasses that fit in one room\nApple may have stolen the show in absentia announcing that the Vision Pro would be available next month, but the headset is still insanely expensive at $3,500. While it's yet to be seen whether\u00a0AR/VR technology will take off, there are plenty of cheaper alternatives, including the intriguing-looking Xreal Air 2 Ultra ($699). The Xreal is a lot more compact than the Apple behemoth, the price is relatively competitive and CNET's Lisa Eadiciccio was impressed by its image quality. However, she says the headset still needs to be tethered to another device, and it'll need third-party developers if it's to have a chance against Apple or even Google.\nA portable, add-on OLED display that folds\nSecondary displays are a productivity godsend, enabling the kind of multitasking that isn't possible even with the widest monitors. While portable solutions are available, the best solutions tend to be tethered to your desk. Maker Asus says the ZenScreen Fold OLED MQ17QH is the first portable OLED display -- and as the name suggests, it also folds! With the superior image quality of OLED, this 17.3-incher should be great for on-the-go movies or gaming, when it hits later in 2024.\nHitch a ride on a flying EV taxi\nThe electric air taxi flies closer to reality with the debut of the Supernal S-A2.\nBanish thoughts of flying cars from your mind. Banish them! The Hyundai Supernal S-A2 is more of a helicopter replacement, only this one comes without the noise or running costs. The S-A2 is a VTOL design\u00a0and, as every Marvel and Call of Duty fan knows, it means the vehicle can take off vertically without a runway -- just like a helicopter. As an electric vehicle the S-A2 is designed for short trips -- say from downtown to the airport -- and the company says that its modular design means it can be easily upgraded with future battery technologies. You may not see one in your backyard or even at your local airport, but the Supernal S-A2 is potentially the start of a new era for sustainable air travel.\nThe future is electric\nHonda promises that the Saloon will match \"the joy of driving\" with steer-by-wire technology.\nAs we get closer to a single standard for EV charging, the future of electric vehicles is bright. CES being what it is, there have been phalanxes of future cars on show with hidden gizmos and plenty of LED bling. At its press conference, for example, Sony demonstrated a Honda vehicle that could be steered with a Dual Sense controller (why?), while LG's concept car has gone the \"board room on wheels\" route -- with a driverless front seat and rotating chairs!\nThe most impressive, and most-likely concept to appear in our opinion, was Honda's own 0 series EV range. While the van had an aircraft-like steering wheel the sedan had intriguing \"steer-by-wire\" controls. Both vehicles boasted cool LED grilles highlighting the new \"floating H\" logo.\nFoldable phones? How about a foldable TV?\nThe C Seed N1, unfolded.\nWhat to do with a TV when it's not being used? You could make it see-through (more on that below) or, if you happen to have a couple hundred thousand dollars lying around, maybe you opt for a foldable TV like the 137-inch C Seed N1 showed off at CES 2024.\nThe custom-built N1 features a stunning, bright, seamless picture,\nand its screen can rotate 180 degrees to face different directions. Divisions between the different sections of the screen were invisible. But when not in use, the N1 folds up into a compact rectangular chunk\nin about two and a half minutes with the touch of a button, forming something that looks more like a metal bench than a large expensive TV.\nOh, and it costs $200,000 for the 137-incher, but hey, that includes installation and setup.\nAstounding CES 2024 Tech Concepts We Can Hardly Wait For\nSteam Deck has a new challenger\nMSI's new game handheld runs Windows but has Intel inside.\nAfter years of near misses such as the Steam Machine, the Steam Deck was an unexpected success for Valve, and the console is the current standard for mobile PC gaming. While the competing\u00a0Asus ROG Ally looked cool, using Windows on it was apparently pretty clunky. Now that situation might change with the help of Intel -- the company has a lot of experience making Windows machines. MSI's Claw handheld obviously owes a debt to the Steam Deck, but it has Intel's new Meteor Lake chips onboard instead of AMD chips. CNET's Scott Stein says this development means more manufacturers will have the opportunity to design their own Steam Deck-alikes that can also run Windows.\nWhat's old is new\nIf\nyou consider yourself an old-school smartphone user, you may yearn for\nthe physical keyboards that used to be a mainstay of the phones of\nyesteryear. The iPhone's on-screen keyboard ushered out the full\nphysical keyboards that were popular on\u00a0BlackBerry\u00a0devices.\nThe Clicks keyboard,\nfrom Clicks Technology, will transform your iPhone 14 Pro or iPhone 15\nPro and Pro Max, adding a keyboard that's actually integrated into a\nwraparound case. This $139 wraparound slides onto your device and runs\noff the phone's battery, so no charging required. Be sure to check out our hands-on review.\nThis phone bends over backward for you\nAs phones with screens that fold in half get more consumer attention, Samsung appears to be poised to flip the market again. The electronics giant showcased a concept handset at\u00a0CES 2024 called the Flex In & Out Flip that can fold in both directions and completely backward, allowing you to use the phone's 6.7-inch screen even when the device is shut.\nWhen bent backward, one side is slightly shorter than the other, to avoid covering the camera, while the larger side was big enough to show several icons in the phone's quick settings menu, media playback controls and the time and battery level. Although the handset is only a concept design right now, CNET's Lisa Eadicicco points out that it might offer a hint at the future of devices that roll, flex, bend, fold and otherwise contort to adapt tech to our unique needs.\nGet to work with this gaming laptop\nMore and more, we're asking our laptops to do double duty. In addition to strong gaming performance, we want to be able to use these thinner, lightweight devices for work or school. The HP Omen Transcend 14, which made its debut at CES 2024, is light enough for a daily commute but sports a 14-inch 2.8K OLED display with a 48-120Hz variable refresh rate backed up by an Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070.\nThe 14-inch laptop weighs only 3.6 pounds (1.6 kilograms) -- light for a gaming laptop and has battery life good for up to 11.5 hours with the integrated graphics and an Eco mode. The new 14-inch size starts at $1,500. A 16-inch version will also be available with the option for a 4K 240Hz OLED starting at $1,900.\nThis thermometer also checks your heart and lungs\nIf you ever wanted to hold up a single device to your head for a quick health checkup, the Beamo might be just what the doctor ordered. The BeamO, which looks like a game stick, is a four-in-one thermometer,\nelectrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope made by Withings and it was\nunveiled this week at CES 2024. Depending on where on your body you \"beam it,\" the device can give you clues about your health.\nThe device, which Withings describes as being \"portable and smaller than a smartphone,\"\ncombines the simplicity of taking your temperature at home with some of\nthe wellness metrics newer-grade wearables and smartwatches carry, like\nblood oxygen and heart rate readings, as well as chest sounds when used\nas a \"digital stethoscope.\"\nFollowing expected clearance from the US Food and Drug Administration this June, you can get one for $250.\nForget a projector, get a huge TCL instead\nThe TCL 115QM891G is a 115-inch TV that's 8.5 feet wide and around 6 feet tall on its stand.\nCNET's projector reviewer Geoff Morrison has been extolling the benefits of projectors for many years, but even he has come around to technologies like OLED and Mini-LED of late. What would he think of the new TCL 115QM891G? This is a 115-inch 4K LCD TV that's up to five times brighter than most TVs, and with better blacks too, according to TV reviewer David Katzmaier.\nAs TV reviewers ourselves we've seen large TVs, but in the old days they were stuck at HD. The pixels on Panasonic's\u00a0103-inch 1080p, for instance, were huge and easily noticeable. This is why 4K technology is so great -- it means you can install a TV as big as a wall, and not see black lines between the pixels. The TCL is also going to be a lot cheaper than that $100,000 Panasonic too, at under $20,000.\nStained glass gets a new lease on lifelong power\nThink you know what solar panels look like? This thing is capturing the energy of light.\nSolar panels are great -- they produce electricity from one of the most abundant resources we have, and they pay for themselves in quick order -- but no one has ever called them pretty. Fear not! Japanese company inQs has worked out a way to make solar cells out of colored glass. The company is exhibiting a number of objects at CES 2024, including a\u00a0stained glass pane that generates electricity. The devices are small, and one was able to power only a desk fan, but we like how they point to a rethink of how solar panels should look and work.\nDisguising weird-looking things has been a perpetual trend at CES, as with LG's ArtCool air conditioners. And this year the Samsung Music Frame lets you put art inside a smart speaker.\nHey, Ida, which is better: Alexa or Siri?\nAI is already everywhere here at CES 2024 -- and adding to the list of products it'll be appearing in is cars. Volkswagen has announced a deal with ChatGPT that\u00a0enables users to ask all sorts of questions of their car, in the same way they would of a traditional digital assistant. At the moment, VW's voice assistant lets users say, \"Hey, Ida,\" to ask a question about something basic, like requesting tire pressure. But the automaker's cars are incapable of answering more advanced questions like, \"When did the New York Jets last win the Super Bowl?\" Under the new deal, if the car's assistant can't answer the question, it'll hand off the query to ChatGPT. (Yes, the Jets did win one. But it was a very, very long time ago.)\nIt's worth noting that competitors like Alexa, Google Assistant and Siri have been completing these queries natively for many years, so teaming with ChatGPT is an easier way for VW's Ida to catch up.\nMust-see-through TV\nThis transparent display, currently showing fish, can transform into a 77-inch TV.\nTVs are getting bigger every year, which means there's a bigger slab of black plastic taking up a significant portion of the living room wall when it's not in use. But what if we could make it disappear, without actually pulling it off the wall?\nLG has apparently done just that with a\u00a0transparent OLED screen\u00a0that converts from a \"fish tank\" to a 77-inch television (pictured above). Unlike Samsung's competing technology this will apparently be a real product, shipping later in 2024.\nMeanwhile Samsung is showing off the first transparent version of its\u00a0Micro-LED display tech\u00a0at\u00a0CES 2024. While transparent OLED and even LCD-based screens have been around for a while, Samsung says its Micro-LED display technology produces brighter, clearer images\u00a0and\u00a0is more transparent than the current tech. But Samsung says its transparent Micro-LED tech isn't available in the market, so what Katzmaier saw (or didn't see?) is essentially a concept.\nA 2-minute ice cream maker\nWe scream for ice cream.\nComing soon to a restaurant near you: freshly made ice cream, ready from start to finish in just 2 minutes.\nWe've loved trying the vanilla ice cream churned out by the speedy ColdSnap -- first in 2021 and then again this year. We're still a year away from being able to buy one of these innovative ice cream makers for our homes, but the company came to CES this year with the news that its restaurant partners will have hold of the machines much sooner.\nThe countertop ice cream maker uses Keurig-like pods to make a bowl of the cold stuff in less than 2 minutes. The finished result has a gelato-like consistency that had us coming back for more every time we passed the ColdSnap booth.\nRobot stain fighter\nSamsung is set to unveil its Bespoke Jet Bot Combo this week at CES in Las Vegas.\nHere's a product sure to clean up -- literally. Samsung's new Bespoke Jet Bot Combo, a smart robot vacuum with a mop, does more than just get rid of dust bunnies and dog hair. It's designed to roam your rooms scouting for stains on hard flooring and scrub them out so you don't have to.\nThe robot taps AI-powered object recognition to identify stains on hard flooring. Yes, it can tell the difference between the surfaces, presumably making adjustments to its cleaning technique accordingly. You can also tell this likely $1,000-plus household helper where it can and can't go as it attacks stains as bad as a puppy piddle or a zinfandel spill with a spinning mop that hits 170 rpm. (Pricing details aren't yet available.)\nTeeth tech\nAI isn't just helping keep your floors clean, it's also being used to make sure your teeth are as clean as they can be. The Oclean X Ultra Wi-Fi Digital Toothbrush features an algorithm-controlled motor, five brush modes tailored to specific needs, an interactive touchscreen that shows you areas you missed and, brilliantly/weirdly, an AI voice guide that speaks into your brain via bone conduction to help you improve your technique.\nIt also features Wi-Fi connectivity so you can pair it with your home network, and it will store information about your brushing history until you can download it to your app. It also offers 40 days of battery life through wireless charging. It will go on sale in the US in the fall for $130.\nIt's all in the wristwatch remote\nWhat if your smartwatch could also control your lamps, your Netflix programs and more?\nImagine using your wrist to control everything around you. A flick this way, and you can turn off the lights or scroll through the offerings on Netflix. Finnish startup Doublepoint has developed software that can turn an Android watch into a general-purpose controller for any device via a Bluetooth connection.\nThe software will come to developers in the first half of this year,\nbut it's up to developers and app-makers to decide what a small gesture, such as tapping fingers or rotating your wrist, will actually do.\nSteven Musil, Sareena Dayaram, Katie Collins and Ty Pendlebury contributed to this article.\nComputing Guides\nLaptops\nDesktops & Monitors\nComputer Accessories\nPhotography\nTablets & E-Readers\n3D Printers"
