This doesn't affect our editorial independence.\nSeergrills announces AI-powered Perfecta grill at CES\nSeergrills unveiled its new flagship Perfecta grill at CES 2024. A CES Innovation Award honoree, the Perfecta is the \u201cworld\u2019s first AI powered grill,\u201d according to Seergrills. The grill has a list price of $2,500 and is available for preorder now with an exclusive $1,000 discount until the end of the CES.\nPowered by Seergrills\u2019 proprietary NeuralFire technology, the Perfecta packs a quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure environmental and food variables, including thickness and temperature.\nSeergrill has dubbed its program the aiChef. A cook can set the desired doneness and sear level via touchscreen. The aiChef then takes those instructions and uses information from the smart sensors to dynamically control the grill\u2019s dual vertical infrared burners. These burners pulse and move horizontally, getting closer and further from the food as the program directs.\nThe burners operate at up to 1,652 degrees F and provide 360-degree cooking, simultaneously doing both edges and sides, creating the perfect sear and eliminating the need for the cook to flip. When complete, the burners turn off automatically and return to their home positions.\nSeergrills says the Perfecta prepares delicious and nutritious meals ten times faster than conventional cooking, finishing a 1-inch ribeye steak in 90 seconds and four chicken breasts in two minutes and 30 seconds. Chefs prize the Maillard reaction, a chemical reaction between proteins and sugars that gives browned foods their unique, juicy flavor, and the Perfecta promises to deliver that perfect sear on the outside and a just-so doneness on the inside with ideal moisture retention.\nThe Perfecta combines the custom preferences set by cooks in the Seergrills app with sensor data readings to control the grill\u2019s burner system.\nSeergrills\nConventional grilling methods lead to fat drips and cause flareups that can burn and dry out the meat, yielding inconsistent texture and taste. Perfecta directs all water vapor and gasses out the top, so fat drips into a removable dishwasher-safe drip tray.\nThe Perfecta combines the custom preferences set by cooks in the Seergrills app with sensor data readings to control the grill\u2019s burner system. After each meal, users can rate their meals in the app, creating data that will train the AI and improve cooking in the future.\nNot only will the Perfecta cut cooking times by 90 percent, the grill also uses 50 percent less energy than traditional barbeques, ovens, or air-fryer methods, according to Seergrills. Cooking modes include grill and oven, with the option to add on pizza and rotisserie modules.\nSeergrills also offers the GrillStation for users who want a traditional outdoor grill setup that includes extendable prep and serving stations, drawers for spices and accessories, and an edge rim for hanging utensils.\nAuthor: James Barber, Freelance Contributor\nJames has worked in music as a producer, A&R executive, music publisher, manager and record store clerk.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe world\u2019s first AI-powered grill cooks steak and meat in just two minutes\nSEERGRILLS set to debut the Perfecta, the world\u2019s first AI-powered grill, at CES 2024\nAt CES 2024, SEERGRILLS is set to debut the Perfecta, the world\u2019s first AI-powered grill. Using AI technology, the SEERGRILLS Perfecta is packed full of smart features including sensors, burners and customisable controls that claims to make the perfect steak and other food in a matter of minutes.\nSEERGRILLS is a UK-based startup and a new and exciting name in the cooking industry. After extensive research from the founders and engineers, SEERGRILLS created the Perfecta, an AI grill that claims to be the world\u2019s most intelligent outdoor grill on the market.\nFor both indoor and outdoor use, the best electric grills create delicious barbecue-style food without the need for charcoal, gas or wood pellets. With this in mind, including increased versatility and smart features, the SEERGRILLS Perfecta is the first of its kind to use AI technology to cook your favourite meals.\nLooking at the SEERGRILLS Perfecta, it\u2019s a pretty big appliance when sitting on its GrillStation stand, so you\u2019ll definitely need a good amount of space in your garden or outdoor area for it. Aside from its vast size, the grill itself looks like a more advanced and technical microwave\u2026 and advanced, it certainly is.\nUnsurprisingly, the most intriguing thing about the SEERGRILLS Perfecta is its use of AI technology. The world\u2019s first AI grill, the Perfecta is powered by NeuralFire technology which is said to \u201cfuse the art and science of cooking through the integration of cutting edge hardware and software technologies\u201d. The NeuralFire technology, AI algorithms and smart sensors work with the Perfecta\u2019s integrated dual infrared burners to cook delicious food in as little as 90 seconds.\nThe SEERGRILLS Perfecta has a powerful Quad Core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure food and other environmental factors when cooking, including temperature and thickness of meat. The dual vertical infrared burners offer dual sided cooking for 360\u00b0 coverage that gets closer and further from the food, as the burners pulse and move while in action.\nWhile operating at 1652\u00b0F, the Perfecta takes care of the cooking for you, so you don\u2019t need to flip or turn your food for better searing or coverage. With healthier lifestyles in mind, the Perfecta makes nutritious meals 10-times faster than traditional cooking methods in a healthier and safer way. To reduce fat dripping and fiery flare-ups, the Perfecta exhausts water vapour and gas out the top for quicker clean-ups, tastier food and less risk of burns.\nAside from steak and meat, the Perfecta comes with a variety of modes to choose from, including grill, oven, pizza and rotisserie. On the outside of the SEERGRILLS Perfecta is a touchscreen which allows you to customise your meal of choice. The screen also comes with aiChef, which works to understand your personal preferences and uses this information along with the Perfecta\u2019s smart sensors to control the burners.\nAs with many smart appliances, the Perfecta is compatible with the SEERGRILLS app which allows users to customise their preferences, for example, you can select how you like your steak done. Always looking to improve, the app prompts users to rate their meals which allows the grills\u2019 AI to learn and adapt to create better and tastier food every time.\nAs AI continues to make its way into homes and kitchens, the SEERGRILLS Perfecta is an example of an appliance that\u2019s been given the AI treatment but still has a strong focus on food\u2019s taste, texture and preferences. The Perfecta will be shown for the first time at CES 2024.\nGet the T3 newsletter!\nAll the best features, news, tips and great deals to help you live a better life through technology\nBeth is Home Editor for T3, looking after style, living and wellness.

Do you care deeply about your meats? SEERGRILLS thinks they have you covered with the Perfecta. This AI-powered grill is supposed to deliver the best cooked meats your tongue has ever laid buds on.\nEstimated reading time: 4 minutes\nFor those looking to bring home a taste of innovation, SEERGRILLS will be offering an exclusive $1,000 discount, only until the end of CES 2024. Here\u2019s what the company\u2019s press release had to say about the Perfecta.\nPlease enable JavaScript\nPerfecta\u2019s proprietary NeuralFire\u00ae technology fuses the art and science of cooking through the integration of cutting-edge hardware and software technologies. It hosts a powerful Quad Core processor, and a suite of smart sensors, which measure many food and environmental variables, including thickness and temperature.\nThe aiChef takes the user\u2019s desired doneness and sear level set via touchscreen, paired with information from the smart sensors, to dynamically control the unique Dual Vertical Infrared Burners which pulse and move horizontally, closer and further from the food. The burners operate at 1652\u00b0 F and provide 360\u00b0 cooking, simultaneously doing both edges and sides, creating the perfect sear and eliminating the need to flip. When finished, the burners turn off automatically and return to their home position.\nThe ideal appliance for anyone looking to implement healthy lifestyle changes or become the ultimate grill master but finding themselves short on time, Perfecta prepares delicious and nutritious meals 10x faster than conventional cooking. It can cook a 1\u201d rib eye steak in 90 seconds and four chicken breasts in two minutes and 30 seconds.\nPerfecta optimizes conditions for the chef-favored Maillard Reaction \u2014 a chemical reaction between proteins and sugars that gives browned food its unique, juicy flavor \u2014 with a perfect sear on the outside, perfect doneness on the inside, and the ideal moisture retention. With conventional grilling methods, fat drips and causes flare-ups, potentially burning and drying meat, creating inconsistent texture and taste. Perfecta directs water vapor and gasses out the top, while fat drips into the removable dishwasher-safe drip tray below, for flawless, flavorful food, and a quick and easy clean-up.\nTaking the guesswork out of cooking, users can customize preferences for steak such as doneness and sear level in the SEERGRILLS app. AI then incorporates these preferences with sensor data to control the novel burner system the way a chef would to achieve the best flavor profile, simplifying healthy eating and protein rich meals. After each meal, users can rate their meals within the app, allowing the AI to learn from ratings and improve every time.\nThe unique algorithms and cloud connectivity between all Perfecta devices ensures that when one Perfecta improves, so do the rest around the world. The precision of NeuralFire\u00ae technology also eliminates the health risks of both under and overcooking. This optimization of cooking profiles for every food not only cuts cook time by 90%, but also uses 50% less energy than traditional BBQs, oven or air-fryer methods, leading to significant cost and energy savings.\nEquipped with various cooking modes, users can select options such as Grill or Oven, with the option to add on Pizza and Rotisserie modules. For those that are hungry for more control, Chef Mode allows users to have full command over the burners to enjoy the time-honored ritual of cooking. Users can also enjoy various recipes within the app, and customize nutrition goals to track healthy eating. To complete the Perfecta experience, SEERGRILLS offers a GrillStation for a traditional outdoor grill set up, complete with extendable prep and serving stations, drawers for spices and accessories, and a rim along the edge to hang utensils.\nThe SEERGRILLS\u00ae Perfecta\u2122 is being shown to the public for the first time at the 2024 CES in Las Vegas. Throughout the duration of the show, ending January 15, SEERGRILLS will be offering a $1,000 discount on the Perfecta, MSRP $3,500, available on the company\u2019s website, see link below.\nWhat do you think of this cooking gadget?

        "raw_content": "Seergrills Unveils AI-Powered Perfecta Grill at CES 2024\nCES has evolved into a grilling showcase, with companies continuously infusing tech into outdoor cooking experiences. Among them, UK-based startup Seergrills has brought AI innovation to your patio with its flagship model, the Perfecta, capable of cooking a one-inch-thick ribeye steak in just 90 seconds. According to the company, this grill cooks food approximately 10 times faster than traditional methods.\nThe Perfecta, resembling a see-through countertop oven, features dual vertical infrared burners inside that simultaneously cook both sides of the food, expediting the process and eliminating the need for flipping. Seergrills boasts that these burners can reach temperatures of up to 1,652 degrees Fahrenheit, ensuring crispy edges through 360-degree heating. The grill incorporates an AI chef that takes into account desired doneness and sear level, calculating the optimal cooking time and temperature based on the type of food being prepared. Sensors detect the thickness of items like steak and chicken, preventing overcooking or undercooking, and the burners adjust their proximity to the food as necessary throughout the cooking process. Seergrills dubs this intelligent setup \u201cNeuralFire,\u201d equipped with a quad-core processor and various sensors for collecting cooking data.\nThe vertical orientation of the grill eliminates flare-ups, with only smoke and water vapor exiting through the top, while fat and grease are collected in a dishwasher-safe drip pan at the bottom. In addition to grilling, the Perfecta offers oven and rotisserie modes for preparing dishes like pizza and roasted chicken. It also includes a Chef Mode for full manual control. Seergrills has designed a grill cart for a complete outdoor cooking setup. Powered by gas, the Perfecta features a 12-volt electrical cord for its onboard electronics, which include a touchscreen for inputting cooking parameters.\nWhile it wasn\u2019t possible to witness the grill in action at a tradeshow table due to its outdoor nature, Seergrills has announced that it will be available to early buyers before the end of the year.\nSeergrills plans to ship the Perfecta in Q4 of 2024, with a price tag of $3,500. Early adopters can take advantage of a $1,000 discount until the conclusion of CES.\nBy Impact Lab\nPost navigation\nCopyright 2020 Impact Lab LLC | Impact Lab is owned and operated by Impact Lab LLC.\nBy delving into the futuring techniques of Futurist Thomas Frey,\u00a0you\u2019ll embark on an enlightening journey.\nLearn More about this exciting program."

It's literally the hottest thing at the show as the Perfecta uses dual vertical infrared burners to pulse and move horizontally, reaching as high as 1,652\u00b0 F while providing 360\u00b0 cooking.\nThe result is a high-tech grill that can cook a 1-inch ribeye steak in as little as 90 seconds and four chicken breasts in 2 minutes and 30 seconds. So where does the AI come in?\nSeergrills says\u00a0that it uses a powerful quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors which measure aspects of the food and environment, including thickness and temperature. You set your desired doneness and sear level via a touchscreen interface.\nThe benefit of the vertical burners and 360\u00b0 cooking is that you don't need to flip, so the Perfecta does the edges and sides simultaneously. Plus, you don't have to worry about flare-ups while you grill, as the Perfecta exhausts water vapor and gasses out the top while catching fat drips in a dishwasher-safe drip tray below.\nThe Perfecta app lets you take things further, setting your preference for doneness and sear level but also enabling you to rate your meals within the app so the AI can learn and improve over time.\nYou'll need a 12V electric connection as well as a propane hookup to use the Perfecta. And the company says its stainless steel and ceramic glass design is build to withstand the elements.\nI see two drawbacks here. One is the astronomical $3,500 price, though there's a $1,000 discount for those who pre-order theirs before January 15 through www.seergrills.com.\nMy other reservation is about the sheer joy of grilling. It's one of those few times I get to disconnect from tech and just enjoy the backyard, especially during the summer. I don't mind cooking steaks for the usual 5 to 6 minutes per side. Plus, not everyone in the family wants their steaks cooked the same way.\nRegardless, I look forward to seeing how well the Seergrills Perfecta works in the real world.\nCheck out our CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "The Perfecta grill uses AI to help cook a steak in 90 seconds\nSeergrills debuted the $3,500 cooking device at CES 2024.\nCES has increasingly become a grilling show, with companies constantly finding ways to bring more tech to your deck or patio. One company that's added a dash of AI to its spice rack is Seergrills, a UK-based startup comprised of engineers and product developers. Its flagship model, the Perfecta, can cook a one-inch-thick ribeye steak in 90 seconds. Overall, the company says the grill, a unit that looks more like a see-through counter-top oven, cooks foods around 10 times faster than conventional cooking methods.\nInside, dual vertical infrared burners cook both sides simultaneously, which not only expedites the process, but it also eliminates the need to flip. Seergrills says the burners top out at 1,652 degrees Fahrenheit and the unit can even ensure edges are crisp thanks to 360-degree heating. A built-in AI chef takes the desired doneness and sear level into account, calculating the proper cooking time and temp based on the food. Sensors detect the thickness of things like steak and chicken to prevent over or undercooking and the burners automatically move toward and away from foods as needed during the process. The entire smart setup is what Seergrills calls NeuralFire, with a quad-core processor and host of sensors for gathering cooking data.\nThe vertical orientation nixes any flareups, according to the company, as only smoke and water vapor are exhausted out of the top, with fat and grease collected in a dishwasher-safe drip pan at the bottom. The Perfecta also has oven and rotisserie modes, so you can cook pizza and roasted chicken with ease. There's a Chef Mode too, offering full control over the unit. Plus, the company has designed a grill cart for a full outdoor setup. Due to the power of the burners, the Perfecta runs on gas, with a 12-volt electrical cord for the onboard electronics. Those include a touch screen for entering your desired cooking parameters. Since this is an outdoor grill after all, we weren't able to see it cooking at a tradeshow table. but the company says it will be available to early buyers before the end of the year.\nSeergrills is planning to ship the Perfecta in Q4 of 2024 at a price of $3,500. Early adopters can save $1,000 through the end of CES.\nSeer Grills Perfecta\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12. Keep up with all the latest news from the show here."

From smart induction ranges to under-counter refrigerators to pull-down faucets, the range of scope for moderation and iteration in the kitchen has become endless. Seergrills\u2019 Perfecta AI BBQ Grill falls in line with modern-day technological advancement.\nComing to CES 2024, this AI-powered grill can adjust the temperature, time, and food\u2019s proximity to the heat source on its own. Dual infrared burners aid the process of cooking food to your desired doneness. Moreover, the company claims it can cook any food within three minutes, and cook one-inch-thick ribeye steak in 90 seconds.\nVertical racks in place of horizontal ones hold your food item upright the whole time. It cooks your meat and veggies ten times faster than the traditional grills as it heats food from two sides at once. This power grill reaches temperatures of up to 1,652 degrees Fahrenheit inside the cooking chamber leading to even cooking cycles.\nUnlike standard grills, Seergrills Perfecta Grill lets you leave the cooking scene fearlessly as at no point do you need to turn the food over. In-built smart technology gauges the thickness of the meat tossed in determining the adequate time and temperature for reaching the desired fondness.\nAlso Read: Bob Grillson Wood Pellet BBQ Grill Touts High-Powered Burner, Smartphone Control\nThe AI function can recognize up to 50 different food items and display the total cooking time via an onboard display. According to the grill\u2019s maker, it uses a mix of electricity and propane for cooking. Seergrills Perfecta Grill comes in combination with other suitable accessories to complement the overall cooking process. A standard horizontal rack for pizzas and other standard oven dishes, as well as a rotisserie accessory for roasts, come along with the Perfecta Grill.\nYou can also manage all the grilling routines right from a dedicated app. The Perfecta Grill can be availed at early access with a $100 refundable deposit. It is likely to retail for $3,500 on availability.\nFollow Homecrux on Google News!\nEmbracing her fondness for books, sunsets, tea and dogs, Priyanka hones over eight years of experience as school educator in North India.

We already saw a bunch of fantastic announcements ahead of the show, and so far Las Vegas has been host to brand new TVs, appliances and even a smarter toilet \u2014 to name but a few.\nBut that\u2019s only scratching the surface, and as we head into Day 2 there\u2019s plenty more exciting and fascinating products on display. Products like smart iPhone docks, new mobile gaming controllers and a brand new kind of foldable phone. It\u2019s only a concept, but it\u2019s exciting to see where that could go in the future.\nNow that Day 2 of CES 2024 is here, these are 9 more gadgets that you need to know about.\nSerafim S3 mobile gaming controller\nThe BackBone One may be one of the big players in the mobile gaming scene, but the Serafim S3 mobile gaming controller is looking like a serious contender. On the basic level there\u2019s a comfortable ergonomic grip and compatibility with a whole range of phones, there\u2019s also \u2018Hall Effect\u2019 joysticks and triggers.\nThat means it\u2019s impossible for those sticks to drift while also offering smooth, seamless movement. Anyone that\u2019s had a busted Nintendo Switch knows how big a deal this is. The companion app will also offer a bunch of the same features as the competition, including easy access to recently played titles, one click recording and screenshotting. And without needing a subscription.\nThe Serafim S3 is compatible with Xbox Game Pass, PlayStation, Steam, Google Play, Amazon Luna and Nvidia GeForce now. The company is aiming to release in the first half of this year for an unspecified price point \u201cunder $199\".\nSamsung Ballie\nFirst LG announced an AI companion that roams your home, and now so does Samsung. Meet Ballie, a round (ish) droid that can roam around your home and do a bunch of stuff while it\u2019s exploring. And yes, much like a dog, this robot will come and greet you at your front door when you get in from work. It\u2019ll also respond to summons, which is more than I can say for my dogs.\nOther functions here include the ability to control smart home products, and the ability to learn and adapt from your routine to do stuff automatically. But the key feature is that Ballie is also a fully-functional projector. The bot can automatically adjust its position and picture based on ambient light and wall distance. The downside is we don\u2019t know when it\u2019ll go on sale or how much it might cost.\nASUS ROG Falchion RX Low Profile keyboard\nAs someone with an aging laptop, it\u2019s frustrating to find that the keyboard starts dying long before the machine itself. That makes working on the go, without my mechanical keyboard, rather tricky. But the new ASUS ROG Falchion RX Low Profile keyboard could be a possible solution.\nThis keyboard is small and compact enough that it\u2019ll fit in your bag, but crucially still has the same tactile sensation of a full-size mechanical keyboard. And to make it slightly less annoying for people out in the world, a layer of integrated silicone foam will reduce the clicky-clacky noises mechanical keyboards are known for.\nThe RX Low profile can toggle between Windows and Mac modes and connects to your machine with a 2.5GHz dongle. The small size still has space for volume and media controls, and an interactive (totally customizable) touch panel. Plus there\u2019s an optional protective cover to keep those keys safe. The only downside? Pricing and availability hasn\u2019t been confirmed yet.\nBelkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro\niOS 17 has a little-known feature called DockKit, which solves a major problem for smarter Phone stands \u2014 namely the need to pair to a companion app. It\u2019s just that the Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro is the first to actually take advantage of it and push all those smart features through the iPhone Camera app.\nAs the name suggests this is a stand that can automatically track you, with the aid of a MagSafe connector and a 360-degree swiveling stand. Not to mention automatic pairing, the likes of which you\u2019ll be familiar with if you own Apple AirPods, and five hours battery that lets you use the stand on the go. Oh and it will recharge your iPhone in the process, thanks to 15W wireless charging.\nPre-orders for the Belkin Auto Tracking Stand Pro open at the end of the month, and you\u2019ll have to part with $180 if you want to purchase one.\nLenovo ThinkBook 13x Gen 4\nThis isn\u2019t just your ordinary run-of-the-mill CES laptop, complete with all the AI features one would expect from this year\u2019s show. The ThinkBook 13x Gen 4 does have AI, thanks to the Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, but crucially it also supports Lenovo\u2019s new Magic Bay magnetic accessories \u2014 letting you add extra functionality to the laptop on the fly.\nThere\u2019s the Magic Bay Studio that takes advantage of Pogo pins at the top of the display to add a 4K, AI-enhanced webcam plus two additional speakers for better sound during video calls. Prototype accessories also include a miniature fan, a modular SSD, a robot assistant that smiles, a mirror with an LED light bar and a standalone light bar in different colors.\nThe laptop itself starts at $1,399, with up to 32GB of RAM and 2TB of SSD storage in a 13.5-inch laptop. There\u2019s 120Hz refresh rate, 3 USB-C ports, a headphone jack and a 74Whr battery rated for 11.4 hours of web browsing.\nSamsung Flex Liple and Flex In And Out\nSamsung has been the king of foldable phones for a long time, and is faring pretty well in the face of increased competition. But where can foldable displays go from here? Well the new concept devices from Samsung Display have some ideas with the Flex Liple and Flex In and Out concept phones.\nThe Liple doesn\u2019t shut the same way as, say, a Galaxy Z Flip 5. It\u2019s got two asymmetrical halves, and that means part of the screen is still visible when the phone is shut. The idea is that this functions a little bit like a cover display, without looking quite so sleek. The Flex In and Out is definitely more exciting, since the hinge is capable of moving a full 360 degrees.\nWho needs a cover display when the phone bends in such a way that the main screen is effectively a cover display? But while visually appealing, I do wonder how practical it might be. Good thing these are only concept phones, giving Samsung time to figure that out. However it does mean there\u2019s no guarantee that these designs will ever be used in a commercial phone. Certainly not anytime soon.\nTCL QM89 115-inch Mini-LED \u00a0TV\nBack at IFA last year TCL wow\u2019d us with its 98-inch Quantum Dot mini LED TV screen. Now the company is pushing that further, and boosting the size up to a whopping 115-inches with the QM89 Mini-LED TV. This is a screen with a peak brightness of 5,000 nits, over 20,000 local dimming zones, 144Hz refresh rate and a 98% DCI-P3 color gamut.\nNeedless to say this is an impressive piece of kit, especially at such a large size. Naturally for a 2024 screen, this also comes with the AIPQ Ultra Processor to power all the local dimming zones, plus AI upscaling and color production for better picture quality.\nUnfortunately we don\u2019t know how much it\u2019s going to cost yet, though in this case it\u2019s probably one of those times when having to ask for a price tag automatically means you can\u2019t afford it.\nAdobe Edge outdoor security camera\nSecurity cameras are great, so long as they\u2019re within range of your Wi-Fi. LTE cameras can be expensive, and that\u2019s before you take data costs into consideration. But what if your Wi-Fi could extend further, say 1.5 miles? That\u2019s the idea behind the new WiFi HaLow technology, which is inside the Adobe Edge Camera.\nWiFi HaLow uses a 900Mhz band for data transmission, which is how it\u2019s able to reach that lofty 1.5 mile distance. Granted its speed is limited to between 15 Kbps and 15 Mbps, and while that will slow down transmission it should be enough to watch live video. It also means you\u2019ve got a lot more freedom to position your camera, especially if you\u2019ve got a particularly large property.\nLaunching in Q1 2024 for $199, The Adobe Edge will offer a 6,000 mAh battery designed to last a whole year per charge \u2014 aided by the lack of a light and a \u201cdeep-sleep\u201d mode that activates when there\u2019s no motion. Though it\u2019s worth noting it will need an Adobe home security system to connect to (from $139) and a video plan \u2014 which ranges from $4 to $7 a month. But hey, at least the added distance could make that extra cost worth it.\nSeergrills Perfecta\nAI is everywhere at CES 2024, even in the grills. No, we\u2019re not kidding, because the Seergrills Perfecta claims to be the world\u2019s first AI grill \u2014 and promises to be able to cook the perfect steak in as little as 90 seconds. Which may be helpful for those of you that don\u2019t eat your steak quite as rare as I like it.\nApparently this thing offers vertical burners, 360-degree cooking and can reach temperatures as high as 1,652 Fahrenheit. Apparently the AI comes into play thanks to the grill\u2019s suite of sensors that measure the environment, meat thickness and temperature. That way you simply tell it how well you\u2019d like your steak cooked via the touchscreen and it will do the rest for you.\nWhich sounds incredible, but you may be put off by the $3,500 price tag \u2014 the same as the Apple Vision Pro. While pre-orders will come with a $1,000 discount, it\u2019s a lot of money to drop just to save yourself a couple of minutes cooking meat.\nHonorable mentions\nThere\u2019s plenty more on show at CES that we don\u2019t have time to go into much detail about, but is still worth highlighting for one reason or another. If you\u2019re after bizarre AI gadgetry, then you may be interested in the Swarovski Optic, AI binoculars that can automatically identify birds for the lazy birdwatchers out there.\nKohler is also showing off a \u201cmulti-sensory showering experience\u201d complete with control over water, light sound and steam levels. With this and the Bemis smart bidet, it seems like the age of the smart bathroom might finally be upon us. On a more practical note, JBL is expanding its range of touchscreen earbud cases with the JBL Live TWS 3 \u2014 negating the need for a companion app on your phone.\nAMD has also launched a range of AI-capable CPUs and GPUs, with the main benefit being that these should be a little bit cheaper than similar products from other companies. Acer\u2019s new Swift Go 14 laptop also features a touchpad with integrated media controls. It seems Acer is going a little bit weird this year.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nThe 5 best smart grills and smokers at CES 2024\nSmarter ways to heat your meat and other food\nLooking for new ways to heat your meat? CES has got you covered. At the tech industry's largest trade show, we've come across a number of new gadgets that will let you sear, smoke, and saut\u00e9 your sirloin.\nHere's a little look at each of the new smart cooking gadgets we've seen \u2014 including a device that will cook a steak in 90 seconds \u2014 and when they'll be available for you to check out.\u00a0And yes, some of them even use AI.\nBe sure to check out our\u00a0Best of CES 2024\u00a0award winners to see the 23 best gadgets of the show.\nWeber Summit Smart Gas Grill\nTime to clear out some more room in your backyard. The Weber Summit Smart Gas Grill has some pretty fancy features, starting with an infrared broiler on the top of the grill that lets you more easily sear food without having to flip it over.\nIt has a five-burner setup that\u2019s digitally controlled, so you can adjust the temperature from the grill itself (it has a huge color display) or from the Weber app.\u00a0As a neat safety feature, the grill monitors the output from all five burners, so if one goes out, the grill will try to restart it three times; if that fails, it will shut off the gas supply to that burner.\nThe grill can automatically adjust the intensity of the burners to maintain a desired temperature, and will show you on its display where to best place food for direct and indirect grilling.\nThe Summit Smart Gas Grill will start at $3,899, and will be available this spring.\nGE Smart Indoor Smoker\nShortly before CES, we got a chance to check out the GE Smart Indoor Smoker, which lets you barbecue ribs and other meats using wood pellets. However, this electric smoker can be used indoors, which means you don't have to run out to your Traeger or Big Green Egg in the middle of the night or during a rainstorm to check on your cook.\nThe GE Smart Indoor Smoker recently went on sale for $999. While it's not nearly as big as a traditional smoker \u2014 you'd have to cut a brisket into three or four pieces to get it inside \u2014 it still takes up a fair amount of space, so this might be best set up in the garage or your man cave.\nCurrent Electric Grill\nThe most traditional of all the cooking gadgets we saw was the Current grill, an electric, connected grill that's meant to be used outside. Instead of propane, it has two electric heating elements that can be controlled via a central knob, or via the Current app. Current's app will also suggest cooking times based on what you tell it is on the grill, and four temperature probes help ensure that you're not turning that burger into a hockey puck.\nThe Current grill can get up to 700 degrees Fahrenheit \u2014 hot enough to get a good sear on your steak. We liked how easy it was to use the Current's control knob, and while it's not the biggest grill (330 square inches of space), it looks to be a good option for those who don't want to mess with propane or charcoal. The Current grill will go on sale in February, and starts at $799 for a single-zone griddle, or $899 for the dual-zone model.\nRevolution Macrowave oven\nRevolution's Macrowave Oven (see what it did there?) is similar to some smart ovens we've seen in the past, like the June smart oven and the Brava. This all-in-one device can take the place of a traditional microwave, toaster oven and air fryer, using a proprietary heating element \u2014 the same as used in the company's $350 touchscreen toaster (yes, you read that right).\nA touchscreen on the right side of the oven lets you select from a wide range of pre-set food items, though you can manually adjust the time and temperature as you see fit. Pricing and availability have not yet been announced, but a company representative said to look for it by the end of the year.\nSeer Grill Perfecta\nThe most advanced \u2014 and probably the most preposterous \u2014 of the smart cookers we saw was the Seer Grill Perfecta. This grill uses AI to analyze whatever it is you put in it, and then moves two super-hot heating elements (up to 1625 degrees F) back and forth to cook food in a fraction of the time it would normally take. For example, the company says it can cook a steak in as little as 90 seconds.\nThe Perfecta requires both electricity and propane; the entire contraption is made of stainless steel and ceramic glass, and can be used outdoors. The Perfecta won't be available until the fourth quarter of 2024, but you can reserve one now; you'll just have to fork over $3,500 when it ships. For that price, you could take more than a few trips to Peter Luger's.\nCheck out our\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0hub for all the latest news from the show as it happens.

        "raw_content": "Seergrills announces AI-powered Perfecta grill at CES\nSeergrills unveiled its new flagship Perfecta grill at CES 2024. A CES Innovation Award honoree, the Perfecta is the \u201cworld\u2019s first AI powered grill,\u201d according to Seergrills. The grill has a list price of $2,500 and is available for preorder now with an exclusive $1,000 discount until the end of the CES.\nPowered by Seergrills\u2019 proprietary NeuralFire technology, the Perfecta packs a quad-core processor and a suite of smart sensors that measure environmental and food variables, including thickness and temperature.\nSeergrill has dubbed its program the aiChef. A cook can set the desired doneness and sear level via touchscreen. The aiChef then takes those instructions and uses information from the smart sensors to dynamically control the grill\u2019s dual vertical infrared burners. These burners pulse and move horizontally, getting closer and further from the food as the program directs.\nThe burners operate at up to 1,652 degrees F and provide 360-degree cooking, simultaneously doing both edges and sides, creating the perfect sear and eliminating the need for the cook to flip. When complete, the burners turn off automatically and return to their home positions.\nSeergrills says the Perfecta prepares delicious and nutritious meals ten times faster than conventional cooking, finishing a 1-inch ribeye steak in 90 seconds and four chicken breasts in two minutes and 30 seconds. Chefs prize the Maillard reaction, a chemical reaction between proteins and sugars that gives browned foods their unique, juicy flavor, and the Perfecta promises to deliver that perfect sear on the outside and a just-so doneness on the inside with ideal moisture retention.\nThe Perfecta combines the custom preferences set by cooks in the Seergrills app with sensor data readings to control the grill\u2019s burner system.\nSeergrills\nConventional grilling methods lead to fat drips and cause flareups that can burn and dry out the meat, yielding inconsistent texture and taste. Perfecta directs all water vapor and gasses out the top, so fat drips into a removable dishwasher-safe drip tray.\nThe Perfecta combines the custom preferences set by cooks in the Seergrills app with sensor data readings to control the grill\u2019s burner system. After each meal, users can rate their meals in the app, creating data that will train the AI and improve cooking in the future.\nNot only will the Perfecta cut cooking times by 90 percent, the grill also uses 50 percent less energy than traditional barbeques, ovens, or air-fryer methods, according to Seergrills. Cooking modes include grill and oven, with the option to add on pizza and rotisserie modules.\nSeergrills also offers the GrillStation for users who want a traditional outdoor grill setup that includes extendable prep and serving stations, drawers for spices and accessories, and an edge rim for hanging utensils.\nSource link\nWe at Cyber Techbiz are a Multi-platform publisher of Latest News,\nReviews, Articles, Blogs, Guides related to Technology and consumer Electronics globally.\n4 skills that can help companies thrive with...\nBig in China: Apple leads the world\u2019s biggest...\nAsus Expert Center PN53: A powerful mini-PC with...\nCisco brings SSE technology to new Kyndryl services\nOneAdaptr OneGo review: 3-in-1 charger and MagSafe power...\nGoogle Meet update brings closed captions for over...\nCyberTechbiz is a Multi-platform publisher of latest Technology News and information.\nWe have earned a reputation as the leading provider of service news and information that improves the quality of life of its readers by focusing on Mobile, PC, Laptop, Cloud, Networking, Internet, Security, Gaming and Reviews.

        "raw_content": "Guides\nSite Links\nCES 2024: Steak in two minutes? The world\u2019s first AI grill is here\nThe SEERBRILLS is debuting the Perfecta at CES this year. It is the world\u2019s first AI-powered grill and can cook steaks and other meats in two minutes. The customizable features include controls that say they will make you and your guests the perfect steak, other meats, and other foods in minutes.\nAs a UK-based startup, SEERGRILLS is an exciting newbie to the cooking scene and, more significantly, new in the AI-powered category. The SEERGRILLS Perfecta is a large appliance when installed on the GrillStation stand, and you\u2019ll want to give it a fair amount of space in your outdoor area. The Perfecta is the first technical advancement of its kind, and CES is a great place to showcase new technology.\nThe Perfecta runs on a powerful Quad Core processor, and the smart sensors measure not only the food but other environmental facts \u2014 all by AI so that your dish will be cooked to perfection every time. The sensor gauges the thickness of the meat and can decipher between other ingredients in the dish to be cooked \u2014 so that everything comes out perfectly. The Perfecta has dual vertical infrared burners offering dual-sided cooking for 360\u00b0 coverage. These infrared burners pulse far and near the food to deliver the correct cooking times and amounts of heat.\nWant the perfect steak and other recipes?\nThere is no need to ever watch, flip, turn, or worry about your food again when cooked on this grill. You can cook much more than just steak. Use it for a quick pizza or rotisserie \u2014 and when unexpected, hungry guests show up at your door. The grill is outfitted with the aiChef, which works to understand your personal preferences and then adjust to that information with AI accuracy, deploying smart sensors to control the cooking.\nCompatible with the SEERGRILLS app, you will have perfection with the Perfecto every time. This grill will likely not be the only one on the market as other AI treatments are discovered and put to work in the cooking sector. This SEERGRILLS Perfecta will be shown and demonstrated this week for the first time at CES 2024.\nFeature and Inner Image Credit: SEERGRILLS\nDeanna Ritchie\nDeanna is the Managing Editor at ReadWrite.
