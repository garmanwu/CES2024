        "raw_content": "Get a Quote\nOur Story\nGenie was founded in 1966 when Bud Bushnell bought the manufacturing rights to a material lift that operated on compressed air. Customers seemed to be impressed with the \u201cmagic in the bottle\u201d that was used to raise and lower the hoist \u2014 and, the \u201cGenie\u201d name was born. With growing demand for material lifts and mobile elevating work platforms (MEWPs), products such as man-lifts, stick booms, articulated booms, scissor lifts and telehandlers have been added to the Genie\u00ae product line.\nToday, Genie equipment is used in a variety of industries and applications worldwide, including rental, aviation, construction, entertainment, government and military, industrial, as well as warehouse and retail.\n\u201cOur ongoing leadership in aerial lifts is built on our ability to consistently deliver superior quality for our customers. We achieve quality not by chance, but by design. We pursue excellence in all we do, and we never compromise quality for convenience.\u201d \u2013 Simon Meester, Genie Chief Operating Officer.\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 1966\nBud Bushnell was an entrepreneur experimenting in his garage with pneumatic-powered doors. In June of 1966 he began working with a company that made a lifting device powered by bottled compressed air. By September the company was out of business.\nBud thought the lift product had merit. He bought the inventory and started his own company, Genie Industries.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 1966\nLaunched in 1966First lightweight, manual-portable lift Material: AluminumMade in: Seattle, Washington\nCultural Highlight\nYear: 1960s and 1970s\nThe corporate structure at Genie took the shape of an upside down pyramid with customers at the top, team members in the middle, and company leaders at the bottom\u2014supporting everyone above.\nFrom the very earliest days, the Genie team stressed customer service. At trade shows and sales visits they listened to what customers wanted and incorporated those ideas into product designs.\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 1968\nLooking for customers who needed a lift, Bud reached out to electrical contractors from California. Then he had the good fortune to meet with a group of businessmen visiting from a Japanese ironworks company. By the end of 1968 he had orders\nfor 1,500 Genie\u00ae Hoists.\nCultural Highlight\nYear: 1960s and 1970s\nEarly company leaders employed a \u201csharing and caring\u201d management style. They believed in people. They enabled participation and personally thanked people for contributions and good deeds. It\u2019s said that Bob Wilkerson knew\neveryone\u2019s name in the company, even when there were over 1,500 people.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 1974\nLaunched in 1974Becomes THE rental tool \u2014 it\u2019s a tough and portable material liftMaterial: AluminumMade in: Kirkland, Washington\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 1970s\nA new industry developed in response to the construction boom in southern California: rental yards started renting tools to builders. These rental companies grew up with Genie. Bud visited his new customers to see how his products could be\nimproved. It was the beginning of a commitment to customer relationships that continues today.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 1974\nBud was demonstrating the Genie hoist at a trade show when a nearby vendor approached him with an idea: \u201cIf you put three of those together and put a platform on it, you could lift a man.\u201d Bud got to work and created the Genie\nTeletower!\nBud later hit upon another innovation as he engineered lifts with more power and broader appeal: a nesting aluminum mast section. This was the key to the Superlift and the family of material lifts that followed.\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 1970s\nGenie founder Bud Bushnell chose his son-in-law Bob Wilkerson to lead the company \u2014 he became president in 1978. Ward Bushnell (Bud\u2019s son) became the head of manufacturing and Roger Brown led sales efforts. Together, these three\nsupported the company\u2019s growth, innovation, and team spirit.\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 1982\nGenie\u2019s owners continued to reinvest in the company. Sales were up, new products were on the way, and new markets were buying. Genie needed to expand.\nMoving to the rural corner of northeast Redmond gave Genie the space to dream. New, larger self-propelled lifts \u2014 like the Z\u00ae-30/20 \u2014 soon rolled off the lines, changing the market.\nCultural Highlight\nYear: 1980s\nThe Genie team fostered a culture that celebrated success through company-wide events to build optimism, customer loyalty, and team member morale.\nThe original leaders\u2014Bob Wilkerson, Roger Brown, and Ward Bushnell, (below)\u2014started many traditions to reward people for the company\u2019s successes. Fourth of July parties and summer hoedowns brought Genie team members and their\nfamilies together to celebrate and relax.\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 1984\nThe Z-lifts were part of a fundamental change in our designs: new lifts were large, versatile, flexible, and rugged. They relied more on steel, engines, and hydraulics. Before this, Genie had only made portable lifts. Now Genie moved into\nself-propelled booms\u2014the new products opened up new opportunities around the world.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 1984\nLaunched in 1984 Mobile and flexible \u2014 the new standard for up and over lifting Material: Steel Made in: Redmond, Washington\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 1985\nAt first, the Genie team thought the Z\u00ae-30/20 would be purchased by end-users in retail and manufacturing. It turned out that contractors wanted to rent it instead. Equipment renters could make substantial profits renting the\nlifts again and again. They recouped the lift\u2019s original cost many times over. Rental yards even told Genie that the Z\u00ae-30/20 was dramatically underpriced!\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 1992\nLaunched in 1992 First Genie boom (of many to come) for the construction market.Material: Steel Made in: Redmond, Washington\nCultural Highlight\nYear: 1990s\nFrom the very start, \u201cteam members\u201d was the right term for everyone that worked at Genie. Team members were often like family \u2014 and in many cases they were actually related! Genie team members advocated for friends and family\nto fill open positions. They were passionate about their work. People wanted to be a part of this unique culture, and Genie was hiring.\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 1997\nRental companies were Genie\u2019s biggest customers. They liked Genie\u2019s responsiveness, respect, and product support. And they appreciated the opportunity to make suggestions.\nWhen equipment renters said that they wanted to buy all their lifts from Genie, we started making scissor lifts to fill out our product line.\nGenie was also improving the core product line with feedback from our customers. One result: the Z\u00ae-45 became the world\u2019s most popular boom.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 1997\nLaunched in 1997Compact, maneuverable vertical lift.Material: SteelMade in: Redmond, Washington\nCultural Highlight\nYear: 1990s\nCustomer relationships have always been central to who we are. Genie created a legacy of showing appreciation by making lasting memories at our customer events. A long-standing member of the American Rental Association (ARA), Genie often hosted\ncustomer events at the annual trade show.\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: Late 1990s\u20132000s\nGenie realized that we could build better products by bringing the \u201cvoice of the customer\u201d into the production process. Genie worked intensively to learn from innovations pioneered by Toyota. This new production process \u2014\noriginally known as \u201cTotal Quality Management\u201d (TQM) and then as \u201cLean\u201d \u2014 spurred Genie to rebuild each factory around the specific products it produced.\nThe Lean process fit perfectly with Genie\u2019s dedication to incorporating team member and customer feedback. The changes were large and small \u2014 all geared toward making better products and making them more efficiently.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 2000-2005\nSuper booms extend up to 135 feet and rotate 360 degrees. The first offering was the stick super boom, S\u00ae-125. The versatile Z\u00ae-135 boom came next \u2014 it was the first articulating super boom. The new lifts\nfit the needs of exploding rental markets around the world. From shipyards to airports to stadiums, super booms helped people build quickly, safely, and on a large scale.\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 2001\u20132002\nGlobal events in 2001 changed the climate for construction projects on a grand scale. Building projects stalled. Growth of all kinds, all over the world stopped. Genie needed to infuse the company with resources, new markets, and cash. Genie\u2019s\nleaders began negotiations with Terex, a global equipment manufacturing company. In 2002, Genie went from being a family-owned company to being part of a publicly held global company.\nCultural Highlight\nYear: 2002\nTerex understood the value of the institutional knowledge in Genie\u2019s people. Bob Wilkerson had been integral to 30 years of leadership. He stayed for over four years after the merger to help the transition of Genie, and its culture,\nto Terex.\nInformation and values flowed both ways between Genie and Terex. Many Genie managers became Terex managers. Many ways of working that were Genie\u2019s are now adopted by our parent company. And while there\u2019s more formality, the Genie\nteam still hires family members that span generations!\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 2002\nThe acquisition by Terex brought telescoping forklifts (telehandlers) to the Genie\u00ae product line. These large-scale lifting machines returned Genie to where it began: material lifts. But now on a massive scale! Genie modified\nand improved these lifts with customer feedback, just as we do with all of our products.\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 2002\nAt the turn of the millennium, Genie had finally arrived. No longer just a local player in the eyes of competitors, we had international recognition for our quality, service, and complete line of products. With offices in over 15 countries,\ndistribution and production in five locations, the dedicated team members had made this family-owned company a leader in aerial lifts.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 2006\nLaunched in 2006 The ultimate in versatility for reaching extreme heightsMaterial: SteelMade in: Moses Lake, WA, USA\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 2007\nLaunched in 2007 A telehandler built for the global market\u2019s needs to lift materials Material: SteelMade in: Umbertide, Italy\nCultural Highlight\nYear: 2010\nTerex understood the value of the institutional knowledge in Genie\u2019s people. Bob Wilkerson had been integral to 30 years of leadership. He stayed for over four years after the merger to help the transition of Genie, and its culture,\nto Terex.\nInformation and values flowed both ways between Genie and Terex. Many Genie managers became Terex managers. Many ways of working that were Genie\u2019s are now adopted by our parent company. And while there\u2019s more formality, the Genie\nteam still hires family members that span generations!\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 2010\nGenie remains devoted to our customers. We back up our products and we\u2019re on the phone to troubleshoot. Through our close customer relationships we hear direct feedback, and take it to heart.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 2013\nLaunched in 2013With 180 feet of vertical reach combined with 80 feet of horizontal outreach, the SX\u2122-180 boom lift provides excellent access and versatility for tough to reach jobs.Material: SteelMade in: Moses\nLake, Washington\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 2015\nIn 2015, Genie positioned itself to dominate the marketplace by launching the most new products in Genie history \u2014 all designed with a focus on our customers\u2019 return on their investment.\nGenie completed a full line of telehandlers to meet the need on any jobsite. Our expanded fleet provides customers with a single partner for all their needs, whether it\u2019s for buying new machines, maintaining their fleet or providing\nservice and parts.\nGenie celebrated its 50th year in 2016.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 2016\nIntroduced a revolutionary new \u201chybrid\u201d system for boom lifts, offering the next generation of design and technology to the market. The Fuel Electric, or FE, hybrid technology works by the engine-powered generator to automatically\ncharge the batteries when operating in \u201chybrid\u201d mode. In outdoor applications, Genie FE booms can go anywhere and do any project that a diesel boom can do.\nIn \u201celectric\u201d mode, the battery power offers quiet and emissions-free operation for indoor projects, while delivering a full day of uninterrupted operation on a single charge.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 2016\nRolled out a new generation of boom lifts designed to get operators to work at height safely with increasingly heavy loads using a single machine. All Genie XC booms combine the benefits of a dual-envelope design to provide an unrestricted\nplatform capacity of 660 lb (300 kg) and a restricted capacity of 1,000 lb (454 kg), reducing the number of lift cycles and increases productivity.\nBusiness Highlight\nYear: 2017\nLaunched a new education-focused website, Genie Aerial Pros, to connect customers, operators and key stakeholders with industry experts.\nProduct Highlight\nYear: 2019\nIntroduced the next evolution of telematics \\ in direct response to rental business needs: Understanding the information a machine is providing. Focused on actionable information, flexibility and transparency, the information provided is \u201cdescriptive,\u201d\nfocusing on what\u2019s currently happening with a machine, \u201cpredictive,\u201d such as predicting failures in the field based on how the equipment is actually being used, and \u201cprescriptive,\u201d proactively prescribing\nmaintenance and service.\nBuilding the future\u2026\nAs Terex and the Genie team focus on the future you can expect to see us expand our innovative product offerings to meet the needs of our customers. We\u2019ll create leading technologies that make it easier for our customers to do business.\nWe will continue to represent quality in everything we do: safe, dependable products backed by unsurpassed support. Customers will remain our primary focus. The success of Genie is based on the success of our customers\u2014today and in the future."
