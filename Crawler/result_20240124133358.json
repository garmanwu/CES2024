        "raw_content": "CES 2024: AVs, lidar, and tire technology\nLAS VEGAS\u2014More trucks and trucking technology might be displayed here at the Consumer Electronic Show than ever before. While trucking is still a small subset of the thousands of exhibitors who\u2019ve descended upon this desert oasis, you can\u2019t miss the growing commercial vehicle presence here.\nWith a big focus on autonomous driving, Kodiak Robotics, Aurora Innovation, Torc Robotics, and Gatik AI all came to CES 2024, along with up to 300,000 attendees, to show off new developments and partnerships at the Las Vegas Convention Center and up and down the Vegas Strip.\nA lot of these companies\u2019 technologies appeared more theoretical years ago. But the future is almost here, according to the people behind some of the most innovative freight equipment ever seen.\nFleet Maintenance's sister publication, FleetOwner, started covering CES in 2018 when Paccar debuted at what has become the largest annual technology gathering in North America. This year, the sprawling conference and exhibition is full of commercial vehicles of all sizes\u2014from startups to longstanding OEMs. Paccar\u2019s booth this year features its Peterbilt Super Truck II and its Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell truck that is nearing production.\nSee also: Bosch to launch heavy-duty hydrogen engine\nNikola, the first company in the North American market with a Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell truck, used CES to give consumers, analysts, and investors a chance to climb into the zero-emission cabover tractor for rides around the city.\nHere are some news, equipment, and technology that caught our eye during the first couple of days of CES 2024.\nKodiak says its tech is ready for driverless trucking\nKodiak Robotics used CES to show off its driverless-ready Class 8 truck, designed for scaled deployment beginning this year. The road-ready Kodiak truck has redundant safety-critical hardware the company said is needed to scale up commercial driverless operations.\nThe truck uses Kodiak\u2019s sixth generation of AV technology, developed over the past five years. During that time, Kodiak\u2019s real-world testing included 5,000 loads hauled more than 2.5 million miles on U.S. highways. This new truck technology will be used for Kodiak\u2019s driverless operations, which it plans to initiate between Dallas and Houston later this year.\nThe latest Kodiak truck includes redundancy across all safety-critical functions, including a redundant braking system, redundant steering, redundant power, and Kodiak\u2019s custom-designed high-integrity actuation control engine system.\nWhile some of its rivals are partnering with truck OEMs to develop autonomous driving, the Kodiak Driver is vehicle agnostic and designed for upfitting. Kodiak plans to roll out its sixth-generation truck to multiple vehicle types.\nThe latest Kodiak truck features twice the GPU processor cores, 1.6x greater processing speed, 3x more memory, and 2.75x greater bandwidth to run software processes than Kodiak\u2019s first-generation truck. With this launch, Kodiak\u2019s driverless truck design is now feature-complete across both hardware and software, according to company leaders.\nAurora turns to Continental for AV system production\nContinental and Aurora Innovation showed off this Peterbilt 579 equipped with Aurora\u2019s self-driving truck technology. The companies recently finalized the design and architecture of the future fallback system and hardware of the Aurora Driver, a Level 4 autonomous driving system that Continental plans to start producing in 2027. The finalized hardware design comes less than a year after the companies began their partnership to develop high-volume manufacturing of autonomous trucking systems.\nAurora is also working with Continental\u2019s engineering team to update its industrialized fallback system for 2027 production. Autonomous vehicles need built-in redundancies that provide backups in the rare case a component or sensor fails. One of these redundancies is the fallback system, a specialized secondary computer that can take over operation if a failure occurs in the primary system. This dual engineering approach aims to reduce the exposure of the primary and fallback system to single points of failure.\n\u201cFrom day one, we knew we\u2019d need to build a strong ecosystem of partners to bring this technology to market safely and at a commercial scale,\u201d said Chris Urmson, co-founder and CEO at Aurora. \u201cFinalizing the design of our future hardware is a meaningful step toward making the unit economics of the Aurora Driver compelling and building a business for the long term.\u201d\nDaimler Truck\u2019s Torc teams with Aeva on lidar\nTorc Robotics\u2019 next generation of ultra-long range lidar will come from Aeva, a sensing and perception systems provider, the Daimler Truck subsidiary announced during CES this week.\nUnder the production collaboration, Aeva will supply its latest Aeva Atlas automotive-grade 4D lidar technology to Daimler Truck and collaborate with Torc Robotics on its Level 4 autonomous Freightliner Cascadia truck platform, which it plans to commercialize by 2027. Daimler Truck intends to integrate the lidar sensors directly into its production process, allowing customers to spec out the AV technology directly from the OEM.\nTorc plans to offer its virtual driver technology and its supporting \u201cmission control\u201d services as a subscription service. Its driving software will use Aeva\u2019s perception software, built around Aeva\u2019s instant velocity data, to detect objects faster, further away, and with higher accuracy. The multi-year collaboration begins in the first quarter of 2024, with Aeva\u2019s start of production by 2026 and Daimler Truck production ramp by 2027.\nGatik ups AV tire intelligence with Goodyear\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co. and Gatik AI, the autonomous middle-mile B2B logistics company, are expanding tire intelligence technology integration into an autonomous driving system.\nGatik\u2019s autonomous fleet of Class 3 to Class 7 box trucks operates on public streets in the U.S. and Canada, transferring goods for grocery and other retailers. The fleet will be equipped with Goodyear Endurance RSA tires with\u00a0Goodyear SightLine technology, the rubber company\u2019s tire intelligence solution. Company leaders said this enables Gatik to advance its fleet operations\u2019 safety and accuracy while improving delivery uptime and reliability. This year, Gatik plans to implement the intelligent tire solution into a significant portion of its autonomous fleet in North America.\n\u201cBeing the vehicle\u2019s only contact point to the road, the tire can play a pivotal role in enabling the vehicle to react like a driver would,\u201d said Chris Helsel, Goodyear SVP of global operations and chief technology officer. \u201cGatik is revolutionizing the autonomous technology space, and by providing real-time insights through intelligent tire data, we can support Gatik\u2019s autonomous driving system to become even more safe, reliable, and efficient.\u201d\nThrough on-road testing, Goodyear\u2019s tire intelligence data has helped Gatik improve its AV controllers with insights about cornering, braking stiffness, rolling resistance, and tire load.\nNikola\u2019s Tre fuel cell truck draws consumer attention\nNikola Corporation used CES to show off its hydrogen fuel-cell electric Class 8 truck, which is powered by a\u00a0Bosch fuel cell. The company sold 35 of the zero-emission trucks in 2023 and produced more than 40 as it continues to ramp up production here in the U.S.\nTre ride-along trips around Las Vegas drew a lot of attention. The company is also promoting its emerging hydrogen potential fuel energy supply infrastructure through its HYLA brand.\nRead more: The dawn of hydrogen trucks\nNikola\u2019s FCEV features a range of up to 500 miles and a 20-minute estimated fueling time. The OEM is initially eyeing fleet customers in drayage and intermodal operations to regional truckload and less-than-truckload, along with specialized hauling use cases.\nPeterbilt shares Super Truck II successes\nThe Peterbilt SuperTruck II was a prominent feature of Paccar\u2019s CES 2024 exhibition booth, which also featured its Class 8 hydrogen fuel cell tractor. First unveiled in 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy project to improve long-haul Class 8 vehicle freight ton efficiency by at least 100% exceeded those goals, according to the OEM, which reached 132%.\nThe sleek Peterbilt SuperTruck II features an aerodynamic shape with a center drive position that improves overall visibility, a right-hand entry stand-up door, pop-out windows, cameras in place of mirrors, and custom tires and wheels.\nThe program focused on advanced and highly efficient powertrain systems and vehicle technologies to meet progressive emissions standards and Class 8 tractor-trailer vehicle safety and regulatory requirements that influence freight efficiency.\nOther Peterbilt SuperTruck II features included a mild hybrid powertrain, a waste heat recovery system, and a lightweight chassis for improved fuel economy. The split-level integral cab and sleeper features a large, wrap-around dash, 15-inch digital dash display for virtual gauges and critical vehicle data, an additional display for HVAC, infotainment and navigation controls, an articulated seat that rotates left and right, and a pull-out desk.\nOttonomy aims to expand last-mile robot fleet\nFirst- and last-mile delivery startup Ottonomy plans to grow its fleet of 50 Ottobot autonomous robots into the hundreds as it expands its hyperlocal delivery network here in the U.S. and Europe on college campuses, airports, and urban sidewalks.\nThe U.S.-based company announced a strategic partnership with Harbor Lockers and introduced its customized locker-on-robot, Ottobot Locker, here at CES 2024.\nOttobot Locker will support robot delivery options to Harbor Locker locations to streamline customer services for pickup, dropoff, and delivery. In addition, Ottonomy has partnered with Cooler Keg to introduce Ottobot Brew at CES, which would turn the delivery robots into on-demand deliverers of cold brew coffee and beer within geofenced areas.\nOttonomy\u2019s Level 4 autonomous technology is customized for the development of Ottobot Locker in its partnership with Harbor Lockers, on display at both companies\u2019 CES booths. Ottobot Locker runs on the Harbor Locker\u2019s app ecosystem and brings a revolutionary dimension to fixed smart lockers by adding mobility for first- and last-mile delivery.\nIndigo Technologies\u2019 SmartWheels cargo EVs near Lordstown production\nIndigo Technologies has two light-duty electric cargo vans that it intends to produce at Foxconn\u2019s Lordstown, Ohio, production plant.

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nHesai Launches New High-Performance Lidar At CES\nHesai's new AT512 high-performance automotive lidar sensor\nNot so many years ago when automated driving was all the rage, there were more than 70 lidar startups around the world along with some established suppliers like Bosch developing their own sensors. It was alway inevitable that as the technology matured and started to come to market, those numbers would shrink dramatically, and that process has been ongoing. One of the survivors in the sector is China\u2019s Hesai which has just introduced its latest sensors at CES 2024 in Las Vegas.\nLidar adoption has remained relatively slow in North America and Europe, primarily due to slower than expected development of many of the systems expected to use these laser-powered sensors. But there are actually quite a few automakers in China now selling vehicles with this technology including Xpeng, Nio, Li Auto, SAIC and most recently Lotus.\nMuch of the early focus for Hesai was on rotating sensors similar to those originally introduced by lidar pioneer Velodyne (so similar that Velodyne sued Hesai for patent infringement and eventually got a licensing settlement). Those puck-like sensors have been used by many companies developing robotaxi systems including Zoox, Motional, Cruise and the late Argo AI. But they aren\u2019t really well suited to consumer vehicles, so Hesai has been developing other form factors.\nThe newly announced AT512 lidar is a high-performance sensor that is designed for mounting above the windshield, similar to what Luminar is doing with its sensors on Volvo, Polestar and SAIC vehicles. Unlike Luminar which uses 1550 nm lasers, all of Hesai\u2019s sensors are based on 905 nm lasers which are significantly lower in cost but the power output also has to be limited in order to avoid causing eye damage.\nDespite the lower power, Hesai claims a detection range of 300 m on a target with 10% reflectivity and a resolution of 2,400 x 512 pixels over a 120-degree horizontal field of view. This is generally considered to be sufficient for scanning the road ahead when driving at highway speeds beats the 250 m range claim of the Luminar Iris sensor. The AT512 has 8 times the resolution of the existing AT128 sensor, but is slightly smaller in volume.\nTrump Wins New Hampshire Primary\u2014Defeating Haley\nBiden Wins New Hampshire Democratic Primary\u2014Despite Absence From Ballot\nNikki Haley Vows To Stay In GOP Race After Losing New Hampshire To Trump\u2014Who Calls Her \u2018Delusional\u2019\nThe AT512 would be well suited to applications such as hands-free and even eyes-off driver assist systems. At 10 frames per second, it can generate 12,300,000 points per second.\nHesai ET25 lidar sensor designed for mounting behind the windshield\nThe second sensor that Hesai is showing at CES is the ET25. This is a slimmer sensor that is only about 1-inch tall and is very quiet at only 25 dBa while only consuming 12W of power. This sensor is specifically designed for installation behind the windshield where Hesai claims it can still detect 10% reflectivity targets at 225 m. The ET25 can only generate 3,000,000 points per second, but that should still be sufficient for hands-free systems like GM\u2019s Super Cruise as well as for enhanced automatic emergency braking systems. Like the AT series sensors, the ET25 is also a 905 nm unit but rather than the 1D rotating mirror, it uses a proprietary beam steering system that Hesai isn\u2019t discussing.\nHesai \"Maxwell\" R&D and manufacturing center near Shanghai, China\nMounting behind the windshield provides several advantages including being able to install it within the swept area of the windshield wipers to maintain visibility as well as improved aerodynamics and aesthetics and reduced risk of damage from debris. Behind the windshield mounting does require that an area of the glass needs to have left clear of infrared filter coating to allow the laser pulses to pass through. The only system that has currently been announced for production with a lidar behind the windshield is GM\u2019s Ultra Cruise which is expected to launch sometime in 2024 on the ne Cadillac Celestiq using a Cepton lidar sensor.\nHesai has also recently completed construction of its new \u201cMaxwell\u201d R&D center and factory near Shanghai, China. It is named after Scottish physicist James Maxwell who developed the equations that describe electromagnetism, optics and circuits. The 740,000 square foot facility is now producing over 10,000 sensors per month."
