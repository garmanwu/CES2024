Though AI was mainly represented in\u00a0chatbots\u00a0in the past year, companies are now finding more innovative ways to incorporate the technology into hardware, including everything from futuristic robots to laptops to products that would have never been possible before.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWith so many AI-related announcements at CES this year, it can be difficult to distinguish between what's simple AI-washing and what's actual visionary technology. To help you understand what's most important, I've created a roundup of the AI and robots that have distinguished themselves from the rest based on factors such as helpfulness, uniqueness, and real-world applications.\nWith two press days and two event days down, I have seen a majority of what CES has to offer, including A LOT of product demos. To find out what my top picks for the best AI-infused products at CES are, keep reading. Also, most of my picks also happen to have won CES 2024 Innovation Awards, showing just how good these devices are.\n1. Motion Pillow\nThe Motion Pillow uses AI to help tackle snoring problems and give you a better night's sleep. The AI Motion System detects a user's snoring and slowly inflates airbags to lift their head and open their airway to reduce it. The accompanying app tracks sleep data, including snoring time, airbag operation time, sleep score, sleep time, and even recordings of your snoring to play back later.\nTo build on the technology, the company also introduced an accompanying Motion Ring to monitor your sleep status in real time and send data to the motion system for a more seamless experience. The combination of the ring with the pillow, known as motionsleep, earned the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Smart Home category.\nThe Motion Pillow alone costs $699, but it's 40% off during the CES exhibition period, retailing at $420.\n2. Bmind Smart Mirror\nThe Bmind Smart Mirror claims to be the world's first AI-powered smart mirror for mental wellness, according to manufacturer Baracoda. Leveraging generative AI, the mirror can provide personalized recommendations, such as light therapy sessions, guided meditation, and self-affirmations based on your mental state, to help improve your mood and manage stress.\nWhen I demoed the mirror, it asked me how my day was, and for testing purposes, I said it went terribly. Immediately, the mirror said encouraging words to me, switched the lights to a calming blue color, displayed an image of nature, and encouraged me to start a meditation session.\nThe mirror was even recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Smart Home category.\n3. Minitailz Smart Dog Collar\nIf you are a dog mom like me, you're probably always thinking of ways you could make your pet's quality of life better. Invoxia's Minitailz dog collar is a fitness tracker for your dog, and can help you better understand what they need.\nThe tracker detects a dog's GPS location to ensure your fur baby never gets lost, along with health stats such as resting heart rate and breathing. The company claims that the collars can detect early signs of heart failure before the onset of symptoms. The collar also offers AI-driven activity detection with real-time alerts that can let the pert owner know exactly what their pet is doing.\nThe Minitailz Smart Dog Collar was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award Honoree in the Artificial Intelligence category.\nIf you are interested, the Minitailz collar is available for $99. However, there is also a subscription fee of $25 a month or $275 a year.\n4. Yarbo Multi-Purpose Intelligent Yard Robot\nTaking care of your yard can be a hassle, with the grass alone requiring cutting, fertilizing, and watering. The Yarbo multi-purpose yard robot system has a family of products designed to take care of nearly all your backyard tasks, including a snow blower, lawn mower, granular spreader, liquid spreader, and more.\nThe best part is that they all work with the same power docking station for a seamless experience. Many of the solutions are already available for purchase online, with newer models available for pre-order.\nAlso: The best robot lawn mowers\n5. Wim\nThe Wim first caught my attention because I had never seen an apparatus like it. Upon learning more, I realized that the technology was as innovative as it looked. The product is meant to assist in walking and exercising in a safe and efficient manner by providing the proper support.\nIt also includes personalized AI coaching that can help enhance your exercise experience by adjusting the intensity and timing and providing customized programs. The insights can also help with non-exercise coaching, such as improving walking performance. This could be especially helpful for people recovering from injuries or those with mobility challenges. When I tried it on, I was surprised to see how natural it felt and how unobstructed my walking was.\nThe product -- from South Korea's\u00a0WIRobotics\u00a0-- was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Accessibility & Aging Tech, Robotics category.\nSales for the product will begin in February, and I was not informed about pricing.\n6. Holobox\nThe Holobox makes hologram communication, which was typically limited to sci-fi movies, a reality. The box, which resembles a telephone booth, can display a real-life hologram of the person you are talking to, as long as they are in front of a white, well-lit background. They can communicate with you in nearly no latency, and even if you aren't in front of a white background yourself, the other call participant can still see you via monitor like a standard Zoom call instead of a hologram.\nYou can click here for a snippet of my experience, where I got to chat with the hologram of Holoconnects' CEO, Andre Smith.\nAlthough the technology seems complicated, it is a \"plug and play\" system, requiring only an outlet and the internet to function. The company also offers a desktop version, fittingly called the Holobox Mini. The website does not reveal the pricing for its solutions, but interested customers can request a pricing list.\n7. Ecovacs Deebot X2 Combo robot + stick vacuum\nOne of the most popular and practical robots is the robot vacuum. But a popular complaint about them is that no matter how efficient they are, they can often miss certain corners or nooks of your living space. Ecovocs addresses that issue by including a stick vacuum with its robot vacuum.\nThe charging station for the actual robot vacuum holds a concealed stick vacuum, which you can assemble to form a Matter-certified wireless stick vacuum with 8000Pa of suction. Now, if your robot misses something, getting to it yourself is easier.\nThe vacuum will be available at the end of March for $1,599.\n8. Nimble Beauty\nThe PR person delivering the demonstration called this AI-powered manicure device \"a Nespresso machine for manicures,\" and that title could not be more fitting. In the same way that a Nespresso machine can deliver barista-quality coffee to your home at the touch of a button, the Nimble Beauty device can act as an at-home nail salon. All you have to do is insert your hand and click a button, and the machine will do the rest using AI.\nI demo-ed the technology, and was the manicure perfect? No. But was it better than when I painted my right hand with my non-dominant left hand? Absolutely. The best part, in my opinion, is the convenience of not having to leave the house to get your nails done or worry about booking an appointment. Another benefit is that it has a fan that dries your nails between coats, so you don't have to worry about smudging them.\nThe device was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Home Appliances category.\nThe machine is available for preorder and costs $599 for the machine and $10 per nail polish capsule. Shipping begins in March.\n9. Ballie\nBallie, the circular household assistant robot, isn't new to Samsung\u00a0 -- it first launched in 2020. However, at this year's CES, Samsung showcased a revamped Ballie with new capabilities and AI features. The robot can now do everything from projecting video to managing home appliances.\nHaving watched the Samsung demo in person, I must say that I am not only impressed but would welcome the cute little basketball-looking robot into my home. Ballie was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Robotics category.\nSamsung didn't disclose when it will be available or how much it will cost.\n10. Moonbird\nAs soon as I saw a sign that said that this device could reduce stress, I had to stop by the booth. The device, which fits in the palm of your hand comfortably, can help you reduce stress and anxiety by coaching you to breathe properly.\nThe device expands in your hands when you are supposed to breathe in and contracts when you are supposed to breathe out. This breathing exercise helps you slow down your breathing and concentrate on the act, which should, in turn, balance your autonomic nervous system. The device also has a sensor where you place your thumb to monitor certain metrics such as heart rate.\nThe device is available for purchase in four colors for $199.\n11. Anura MagicMirror\nAlthough this looks like an ordinary tabletop mirror, the Anura MagicMirror can do more than just show you your reflection. With a 30-second face scan, the mirror can gather your health data, such as heart rate and blood pressure.\nI got to demo the technology at CES, and it's as easy and intuitive to use as it sounds. The mirror was recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Awards Honoree in the Digital Health category.\nAlthough it seems like a fun gadget to have in your home, the PR team informed me that the intended audience is B2B such as doctors' offices or gyms.\n12. Nobi Smart Lamp\nNobi's smart lamps can ensure your older loved ones stay safe by doubling as fall detectors. The lamps use AI to detect when a person has fallen. After it detects the fall, it will notify designated emergency contacts, who can then talk to the fallen individual via the lamp, and even see the position the person is lying in.\nAt CES, the company announced the introduction into the US market, as well as the Nobi Ceiling, which is a ceiling version of its smart pendant lamp. From seeing it in person, I was amazed at how much like a regular lamp it looked.\n13. Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite\nIf you have read any of my CES roundups, you probably picked up on the fact that I love dogs. The Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is a device I am particularly excited about because it has the potential to improve the quality of dogs' lives significantly, and what could be better than that?\nThe Smart Tracker is placed on your dog's collar to track its behavior throughout the entire day. Then, based on your dog's activity levels and sleep, it lets you know the exact amount of food you should be feeding your dog for breakfast and dinner. The bowl has a button that will light up green when you have fed the proper amount or red when it's over or under, eliminating the need for measuring cups.\nI personally have met so many overweight dogs who could use losing some pounds, and this device eliminates the guesswork, helping the parents feed them the perfect amount and allowing them to get to an ideal lifestyle soon.\nAlthough it just launched at CES, the Ilume Dog Wellbeing Smart Suite is available for purchase at $250, which includes the smart tracker, the hub, and the bowl.\n14. Rabbit R1\nIf you have ever wanted an AI assistant that can just do things for you without the need for lengthy and detailed prompts, the Rabbit might be the device for you. The pocket-sized Rabbit leverages AI to act as a personal assistant that can use apps for you.\nAlso: This AI startup made a $199 gadget that replaces apps with 'rabbits' - and it might just work\nEssentially, the R1 would eliminate having to scramble to find the right app on your phone, and then following through to complete the action you need. Instead, with the device, you can have some \"rabbits\" complete the task for you from start to finish simply by telling it what end-result you want done.\nThe device is $199 and is available for preorder.\nRelated\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech\nThis one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nAI will unleash the next level of human potential. Here's how it happens - and when"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: The Best Pet Tech We've Seen So Far\nCES 2024's pet tech reveals are focused on helping you get closer to your four-legged friend.\nHumans aren't the only species who get to benefit from CES reveals. Samsung wants to help you track your pets.\nBetween transparent TVs and a phone you can flip both ways, this year's CES in Las Vegas has plenty of products and services geared toward making the lives of human beings a bit more high-tech. This year's colossus consumer tech show is not just for humans: CES 2024 has plenty for your furry friend as well.\nFrom an AI pet robot that feeds and cares for your dog while you're away to a collar that can alert you to your pet's potential health concerns, this year's CES has something for pet owners and critters in your backyard. Here are some of our favorite pet tech products that we've seen so far in Las Vegas.\nFor more on CES, here's how AI is a major theme this year and the tech we've seen you can actually buy.\nOro's AI-powered pet robot will take care of your pet while you're away\nOro's AI-powered pet robot lets you interact with your four-legged friend, even while you're away.\nLeaving your dog at home alone all day is truly one of the worst feelings in the world. If your dog has separation anxiety, leaving for the day can be equally as stressful for your dog as it is for you. Enter Oro's AI-powered autonomous robot.\nThis robot lets you check in on your pup with two-way audio and interactive video and dispense treats or food. Since it's powered by AI, the robot can learn your dog's behavior and try to calm it down at signs of distress, Oro said. Oro's AI-powered robot retails for $799 and begins shipping in April of this year.\nRead more: Oro's AI Pet Robot Feeds and Plays with Your Dog When You Can't\nInvoxia's Smart Dog Collar lets you track your pup's movement, heart rate and more\nInvoxia's Smart Dog Collar lets you track your pet's real-time movements\nWearable tech continues to be all the rage, and it's about time that pets get in on the trend. Invoxia's Smart Dog Collar allows you to track your dog's real-time movements, while also monitoring their well-being, sleep, heart rate, appetite and even their bark, the company said.\nAccording to Invoxia, this collar can be used for all sorts of preventative care for your pet. You can use the data the collar provides to give to your vet for diagnostic purposes and catch diseases early before they become severe, the company said. This pet wearable costs $149.\nThe Birdfy's bird feeder gives you real-time data about the birds in your yard\nBirdfy's AI-powered bird feeder can notify you when a bird lands to feed.\nWhile this one isn't directed at the animals inside the home, we still think this high-tech bird feeder is cool because it will help us get to know the animals living outside the home. Birdfy's Feeder comes equipped with a camera and is powered by AI, the company said.\nWhen a bird visits the feeder, the Birdfy app will notify you of the feathered visitor landing, show you a video feed and helpidentify the bird species for you. Equipped with \"bird-friendly\" perches, the Birdfy Feeder is $170, right now.\nPawport's dog door gives you unprecedented control\nPawport's dog door gives owners a bit more control over their pets comings and goings.\nDog doors can be convenient for your pet but kind of dodgy for the people who live in the home, letting in bugs and letting out heating or cooling. Plus, they could pose a security risk. Pawport is trying to tackle some of these issues with its high-tech take on the pet door.\nPawport's pet door is made of solid steel and aluminum and can slide over your existing pet door to create a secure, weather-proof portal. The door opens and closes based on your dog's proximity to the door by detecting a tag on your pet's collar. This tag collects data on when your dog is using the door. The Pawport pet door also comes with an app that allows you to lock and unlock the door remotely, so you can rest assured that your pet door doesn't compromise your home's security. Sign up to preorder.\nWhisker's Litter-Robot 4 makes it so you never have to scoop litter again\nHate scooping litter? Whisker's Litter Robot enables you to ditch that chore\nCat owners on the CES show floor I'm sure all agree with me -- scooping litter might just be the worst chore in the whole world. Whisker's Litter-Robot\u00a0aims to alleviate some of the pain that comes with scooping litter. While litter robots are not necessarily new or groundbreaking inventions, the Litter-Robot 4 seeks to move the needle on odor management and cat safety.\nAccording to Whisker, the upgraded litter robot can track both waste and litter levels in real time and help manage odors. The litter robot can handle up to four cats, so you won't have to worry about shelling out for multiple litter robots if you have multiple kitties. Whisker's Litter-Robot costs $699.\nSamsung's Galaxy SmartTag2 allows you to track your pet\nSamsung's GalaxyTag2 gives up pupdates on your dog's every movement.\nSamsung may be showing off curious foldable phone prototypes and transparent TVs this week at CES, but the company has its eye on pets in the home too. During a keynote address at the conference,\u00a0 Samsung talked about how its Galaxy SmartTag2 can track pets' activities and store identifying information, thanks to Samsung's AI-powered SmartThings application, by attaching a Galaxy SmartTag 2 to a collar or harness. The tracker is $30.\nFor more, here's the extraordinary tech we've seen this week at CES we wish we get our paws on now."

Linked to an app, it provides you with a list of choices if it isn't entirely sure which bird is feasting that day.\nBird Buddy can also provide a live video feed using the camera inside the feeder so you can watch for yourself and save clips and images of the visiting avians.\nThe base model is $239 which is steep for a bird feeder with a smart doorbell inside and you'd want the solar panel roof for an additional $299 unless you want to charge every week.\nDespite the cost our reviewer liked Bird Buddy in part due to a lack of ongoing subscription fee and high quality video.\nThe Flappie AI-powered cat flap\nA post shared by flappie (@flappiedoors)\nA photo posted by on\nFlappie is the latest smart pet technology to embrace AI vision. The device has motion sensors and AI vision technology to spot when your feline friend tries to bring small animals into the house.\nThe Swiss startup says the AI-powered cat door isn\u2019t perfect in every instance, but can correctly identify whether your pet has prey in its mouth in at least 90% of cases.\nIf the AI in Flappie detects a \"gift\" then it locks the door and won't allow the cat inside until it drops its prey. The company says the goal is to teach cats not to bring the creatures into the house.\nOne of the founders did admit that a clever cat could drop the mouse, get the door open and then pick it back up and make a run for it, but that on the whole, it should work.\nIt can also detect a microchip and ensure the cat only opens for a specific pet. It'll launch in the US later this year after an initial rollout in Europe.\nLG\u2019s home-patrolling AI robot\nAnnounced before the event, the LG \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d robot is a small device that can use AI vision technology to monitor pets and home appliances.\nIt patrols your home for any issues, fixes what it can and where it can\u2019t deal with it the cute little gadget reports the issue to its owners.\nLG claims it can also read human emotions, and monitor your home environment \u2014 with temperature, humidity and air quality on the agenda \u2014 to ensure everything is as efficient as possible.\nThe bot is also capable of recognizing your face and voice, ready to meet you at the front door when you arrive home. Part security patrol, part butler, it can also manage and control your smart appliances.\nSamsung's Ballie home robot\nSamsung's new Ballie robot is proof of its commitment to go \"all in\" on AI at CES 2024. The rolling robot has a built-in projector that can display content while it rolls.\nThe advanced AI in Ballie can greet you at the door but also come to you when you call to it. And it can project content when you ask it.\nIt has built-in front and rear cameras to detect and analyze its surroundings and can even learn recurring user patterns to automate various functions.\nAI-powered lights for gaming sessions\nSmart lighting isn't a new thing, we've had LED strips able to react to the environment or bulbs linked to Alexa for some time. This year at CES it is getting an upgrade thanks to advances in generative and vision AI.\nGovee is one of the companies involved in AI lighting, revealing its upgraded Gaming Sync Box Kit 2 and Neon Rope Light 2 at CES 2024.\nLinked to your gaming PC or console, its CogniGlow algorithm responds to what is happening in the game and adapts the lighting for a more immersive experience.\nLighting to monitor your mood\nNobi has unveiled its smart ceiling lamp that uses AI vision technology to detect and prevent falls, monitor health and even track activity patterns.\nIt is being pitched as a tool for the senior living and mobility markets and will be available in the U.S. this year.\nLepro has also announced a new suite of AI-powered home lighting products that use natural language processing to analyze voice commands and tailor the lights based on what you ask, rather than having to set the tone in an app.\nThey can also use facial recognition to analyze the emotional state of a user and change the lighting to match their mood.\nSnore tackling smart pillow\nThe Motion Pillow has been given a wireless upgrade. This is a health technology device that claims to be able to improve sleep and tackle snoring.\nThe AI-powered pillow includes a wireless device that monitors sleep sounds, detects snoring and activates airbags in the pillow to reposition the user's head.\nThe company says being able to move the head improves airflow and removes any disturbances in the nose without causing sleep interruption.\nThe Motion Pillow is normally $699, a lot for a pillow and sound box. At the moment, during CES 2024 it has been reduced to $420 on the Motion Pillow website.\nA mood-boosting smart mirror\nThe Baracoda BMind is an AI-powered smart mirror that will not only tell you that you really are the fairest of them all, but improve your mood at the same time.\nUsing natural language processing to analyze the sentiment of whoever is staring at their reflection, it can provide affirmations and visuals to boost their mood.\nBMind's AI looks through expressions, gestures and tones, adapting to what it determines to be the mood of the user. It can then provide a light therapy session or a guided meditation session to manage stress.\nIt can also help you brush your teeth with an on-screen guide, analyze your skin and monitor the temperature in the bath water. Coming out in the U.S. later this year, it will be priced somewhere up to $1000.\nSamsung fridge turned AI home hub\nSamsung has gone \u201call-in\u201d on artificial intelligence across its phones and home appliances. This includes a new AI Family Hub+ technology that is designed to bring together different appliances.\nit is initially being built into the new Bespoke 4-door flex refrigerator, unveiled at CES. This includes internal cameras and AI vision capable of identifying individual food items. It can then suggest recipes based on what you have in stock.\nAI grill that can cook a steak in minutes\nTom's Guide had the chance to see the SeerGrills Perfecta at CES 2024. This smart grill can ensure you get a perfect cook on anything and do so 10 times faster than other grills. With 360 degree cooking, it promises an even cook without the need to flip a burger or steak, according to the company.\nPerfecta uses dual vertical infrared burners to pulse and move horizontally, reaching as high as 1,652\u00b0 F. The result is a high-tech grill that can cook a 1-inch ribeye steak in as little as 90 seconds and four chicken breasts in 2 minutes and 30 seconds.\nIt uses artificial intelligence to monitor all aspects of the food, environment and cooking process.

        "raw_content": "User account menu\nMain navigation\nWeekly newsletter\nGet the newsletter\nMain navigation\nWeekly newsletter\nGet the newsletter\nThe newest trends in AI pet tech\nSlowly but surely, artificial intelligence (AI) is making its way into pet technology to improve both safety and quality of life for cats and dogs.\nIn recent years, technological advances have touched nearly every human industry. Now the pet industry is starting to benefit, with this science at the heart of new technologies designed to boost the safety and quality of life for companion animals worldwide.\nThe enabling algorithm\nAI\u2019s implementation can be covert (the matching algorithm finding suitable dog sitters in the area, say) or overt \u2013 like cat flaps that use computer vision to identify the animal trying to enter the house. The more ambitious implementations could genuinely transform the industry, as well as the lives of pets entrusted to algorithmic assistance.\nOne of the most exciting frontiers in pet AI is the world of noseprint recognition. In South Korea alone, there are 2 firms working towards this: Petnow, an innovation award winner at the 2022 CES tech trade show organized by the Consumer Technology Association, and iSciLab, a company that made its name with its highly accurate human iris recognition.\nNon-invasive tracking\nLike a human\u2019s fingerprints, a dog\u2019s noseprint is unique and permanently fixed from around the age of 6 months, making it a potentially transformational way of reuniting missing animals with their owners.\nObviously, microchips have already performed this function for decades, but as Peter Jung, Business Development Manager at Petnow explains, uptake isn\u2019t mandated in every country. Noseprint recognition is an inexpensive and non-invasive way of getting the same positive outcome, using nothing more than the phone in your pocket.\n\u201cNoseprints are just with them, and they cannot be damaged or lost like tags or microchips,\u201d Jung says, noting that criminals sometimes remove microchips to resell stolen animals without being caught.\nWith anyone able to identify a registered animal using just a smartphone camera and the app, he sees this as a way of lowering pet insurance premiums, and moving towards the ultimate goal: a world without lost, abandoned or stolen pets.\nNose recognition \u2013 the pros and cons\niSciLab\u2019s ambition is similar, and the company plans to commercialize both in Korea and abroad. \u201cHaving attained 99.99% matching accuracy for dogs, we are\u00a0also seeking to progress our technology to cover cats as well as cattle in the near future,\u201d says the company\u2019s Chief Operating Officer, Meenho Sheen.\nPetnow is also working on enabling cat nose recognition this year \u2013 a tougher proposition due to the smaller size and relative shallowness to a dog\u2019s, explains Jung.\nThough exciting, there are 2 possible drawbacks to noseprint recognition replacing the traditional microchip. The first is that getting a dog to stand still enough to scan a noseprint isn\u2019t always straightforward \u2013 especially if it\u2019s a stray that doesn\u2019t trust you. The second drawback is also of a practical nature: to be effective, a noseprint database needs a critical mass of people to register and use the app.\nThe medical approach\nOther players are looking at the medical potential of AI. Dogiz, a British canine health-tracking app, has a feature called Dr. Poop that will analyze the pet\u2019s stools for medical red flags that could require vet attention. Korean TTcare, meanwhile, uses this science to look for pet conditions visible via an ocular or skin analysis.\n\u201cThe AI has been trained with over 2 million pet image data samples with more than 90% accuracy as professional veterinarians continue to label and verify the signs on photos,\u201d explains a spokesperson for AI For Pet, the company behind TTcare.\nThe company\u2019s data shows that just over 47% of the dog-eye photos analyzed by the app have shown signs of abnormalities, with skin issues coming in second (42%).\nWhile the AI\u2019s training data is sourced from shelters, pet cafes and vets, much of the data samples come from the users themselves. That\u2019s the beauty of AI: as it acquires more data via regular users, its effectiveness grows.\nIndeed, initially, the app could only detect 4 irregularities in dogs\u2019 eyes. Already that number has risen to 11, thanks to an ever-growing data set. TTcare plans to expand not only the number of abnormalities but also the areas that can be checked, such as joints and teeth.\nA niche segment with potential?\nWithin the consumer pet market, AI is still very much in its infancy, and as such, getting market projections on it is tricky \u2013 in part because AI can be anything from the unique selling point (USP) of a product, to a background feature underpinning something else.\nAccording to Kim Bill, Head of Purina\u2019s Accelerator Lab, around a third of the hopeful start-ups vying for the company\u2019s support use AI in some capacity. These include \u201ca couple of applications with nose recognition,\u201d she says.\nOther examples include everything from computer vision programs to analyze pets\u2019 body language, to Internet of things (IoT) devices tracking behavior. Indeed, Purina has its own take on the latter: a connected litter box that can keep an eye on cats\u2019 behavior for early warnings of ailments from Urinary Tract Infection (UTI) to hyperthyroidism.\nThe limitations of technology\nGenerally upbeat about AI\u2019s place in the pet market, Bill remains somewhat concerned about misdiagnoses made by medical tech. An AI-enabled IoT pet collar might report a dog with a dangerously high fever, when it really just sat near a radiator, for example. Worse, such tech could lull owners into a false sense of security if something is wrong that AI can\u2019t yet detect.\nBut she still believes there\u2019s a market for quality products that can help humans understand their animals\u2019 needs. Just as long as AI doesn\u2019t stand in the way of the essential emotional connection between pet and owner.\n\u201cI think if it's used to replace that bonding element between pet owner and pet, then you know, it probably would not have such a high uptake,\u201d she concludes.\nPETS International Contributor\nThe latest articles\nFinancial group Admiral accelerates expansion in pet insurance space\nThe firm acquired the business from Royal Sun Alliance (RSA) in line with its diversification strategy.\nAustralia\u2019s competition regulator not to oppose Woolworths' acquisition of Petstock\nThe watchdog concludes that the takeover of the pet retailer chain in 2022 is \u201cunlikely\u201d to substantially lessen competition.\nMalaysian insect player receives green light to export products to Europe\nVeolia Bioconversion aims to become an \u201cecological champion\u201d after gaining approval to export its insect meal and oil for pet food applications.\nGET THE NEWSLETTER\nWeekly newsletter to stay up-to-date\nFollow us"
