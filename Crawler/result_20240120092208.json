        "raw_content": "Ugreen\u2019s NASync at CES 2024: Redefining Smart Storage with AI and User-Centric Design\nAt CES 2024, Ugreen has made a significant statement in the world of data storage by introducing its new NASync series. This foray marks Ugreen\u2019s expansion beyond its traditional scope of charging and accessories into the realm of Network Attached Storage (NAS), doing so with a flair for innovation and user engagement. The NASync device also targets regular consumers (rather than the enterprise-specific tech users that usually rely on network-attached storage) \u2013 this shift comes with its distinct benefits, as Ugreen highlighted in their keynote, talking about how the NASync could now become the iCloud or Google Drive alternative that you don\u2019t have to pay monthly subscriptions for\u2026 or the Netflix or Disney Plus streaming service that lets you play movies/media you own on any connected device anywhere.\nDesigner: Ugreen\nThe collaboration with Intel is a cornerstone of the NASync series, empowering these devices with Intel\u00ae processors. This partnership brings together Ugreen\u2019s expertise in HDD and SSD solutions and Intel\u2019s robust capabilities in cloud computing and PC components, creating a product that stands out for its technical excellence and user-friendly approach.\nThe integration of AI is a key highlight of the NASync series. This is a core component that transforms the NASync into an intelligent hub for digital activities. The AI in these devices is designed to adapt to user behaviors, streamlining tasks and offering personalized experiences. The NASync device can automatically read text within an image or a document, allowing you to then search for text WITHIN a file (like finding all invoices with a certain client\u2019s name). Ugreen\u2019s Hernan Lopez also demonstrated the ability to create visual tags, with the AI autonomously learning what different objects (or even faces) look like. For instance, you could create a tag for \u201cDrone\u201d and then visually search through your entire database for drone images, with the AI automatically understanding the visual archetype of a drone\u2019s design. It all happens locally, allowing you to build your own Google Image Search right within the comforts of your own home.\nUgreen has also placed a significant emphasis on the design of the NASync, ensuring it is approachable for a wide range of users. The focus on a user-friendly interface, both in the hardware\u2019s physical design and the software interaction, makes NASync an accessible yet powerful tool for anyone, regardless of their technical expertise. Easy hot-swappable drives allow users to add new HDDs or SSDs on demand, and if a drive fails, they can simply swap the old one out for a new one while still maintaining all their data on the NAS.\nThe NASync series stands as a powerful example of Ugreen\u2019s commitment to blending high-tech features with ease of use. It\u2019s a product that respects the user\u2019s need for simplicity without compromising on performance \u2013 ideal for managing large data sets, running AI algorithms, or effortlessly streaming 8K video.\nUgreen\u2019s entrance into the NAS market with the NASync series is reflective of the brand\u2019s evolution and its commitment to being at the forefront of technology. This series is a bold demonstration of Ugreen\u2019s ability to infuse cutting-edge technology into consumer-friendly products.\nAs we look at Ugreen\u2019s new venture at CES 2024, it\u2019s evident that the NASync series is more than a set of NAS devices; it\u2019s a harbinger of how integrated and intelligent technology can become a seamless part of our daily lives. The NASync isn\u2019t just about data storage; it represents a smarter, more intuitive way of interacting with our digital world.\nRelated Posts\nMinimalist wall-hanging CD Player visualizes your music in a unique way\nAlthough digital music, especially through streaming channels, has become the most common way to listen to music these days, they are hardly the only options\u2026\nTop 10 Minimalist Japanese Design Gifts to Enhance Your Daily Life\nThe Japanese design philosophy is appreciated and loved by everyone as it is efficient, detailed, and super organized.

        "raw_content": "How-To Geek\nUGREEN's First NAS Series Includes Six Models, Core i5 CPUs\nAccessory maker UGREEN is breaking into the NAS market with six models to choose from.\nYou might know UGREEN from its many wall chargers, portable batteries, and other accessories. This week at CES, the company is introducing its first network attached storage (NAS) devices, potentially giving Synology and Western Digital a run for their money.\nUGREEN's new NASync Network Attached Storage series covers all the basics: the devices can give you a local file server, video streaming and encoding, and other typical home server and NAS features in one conivnent box. There's a model with two swappable drive bays (DXP2800), two four-bay options (DXP4800 and DXP4800 Plus), a six-bay model (DXP6800 Pro), an eight-bay version (DXP8800 Plus), and a compact model that uses internal NVMe drives (DXP480T Plus). That should cover everything from basic home use to businesses that need reliable file access for many users.\nThe drives are all equipped with two M.2 NVMe slots (in addition to the larger drive bays), which can be used for super-fast storage or cache space. There's a mix of different processors across the series: the two-bay DXP2800 and four-bay DXP4800 using a 12th generation Intel N series CPU, the four-ay DXP4800 Plus has a 12th gen Intel Pentium Gold, and the rest have 12th gen Intel Core i5 chips. The connectivity options, maximum supported RAM, and other hardware also varies by model. Several of the units have two Thunderbolt 4 ports, giving you a super-fast way of moving files or just adding even more storage.\nThe software features and experience are critical with any NAS system: all the storage in the world doesn't matter if it can't run the apps and services you want. UGREEN is promising an all-in-one app with the ability to stream movies, access photos, and transfer files from any device. That includes the ability to recognize details in photos and search by text, similar to Google Photos\u2014we'll have to wait and see how well that works. UGREEN also told us at CES that support for Docker is planned, which would make it about as capable as any other dedicated NAS system.\nSecurity is also an important consideration with NAS products, as we've learned from the multiple hacking problems with Western Digital's \"My Cloud\" NAS devices. UGREEN says its devices have \"reliable local space and robust transmission and account encryption protocols to safeguard your sensitive information.\" Again, we'll have to wait and see what safeguards show up on the final product.\nUGREEN will open pre-orders for the NASync Network Attached Storage series on Kickstarter sometime in the near future. You can sign up for email notifications on the company's website to know when the pre-orders go live.\nSource: UGREEN\nThe Best Tech Newsletter Around\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nCorbin Davenport is the News Editor at How-To Geek\u00a0and an independent software developer.

The DX480T Plus is the smallest in the NAS line at 7.0 x 5.6 x 2.0 inches and developed with an emphasis on high-performance and portability. SSD storage spaces allow for up to 16TB of fast, all-flash storage space. An expandable RAM drive provides up to 32GB of memory for high-speed processing, and powering the homemade Ugreen OS Pro(UGOS Pro) is Intel's very own 12th gen Core i5 10 Core processor. Boosting data and media transfer speeds are two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports providing up to 40Gb/s of transfer speeds, making it one of the smallest, fastest NAS devices around.\nAccompanying the release of the DX480T Plus are the NASync DXP8800 Pro and DXP4800 Plus, both equipped with Intel 12th gen premium CPUs, expandable RAM, and 4 bays for the 4800 and 8 bays for the 8800. The 8800 Pro also comes equipped with two Thunderbolt 4 ports.\nWith the increase in Electric Vehicles, the desire for EV accessories to facilitate an easier car care and cleaning experience is quickly becoming an equivalent necessity. At CES 2024, Ugreen will exhibit an EV accessory line for the EV enthusiast. There are a plethora of accessories to choose form including:\nTwo portable Ugreen Tire Inflators. The smaller inflator is powered by two lithium-ion batteries with a total capacity of 2500mAh, and the larger version is a 12-volt plug-in via the car cigarette port. Both provide an intuitive display that conveys important information regarding tire pressure units, with the larger version providing additional adjustment buttons for customized pressure values, an LED light to help illuminate the tire, and supports a maximum pressure of 150 psi.\nThe Ugreen 300-watt Car Power Inverter converts your car cigarette outlet into a plug-in adapter that supports power to two AC outlets, one USB-C and one USB-A port simultaneously.

        "raw_content": "Ugreen\u2019s NASync at CES 2024: Redefining Smart Storage with AI and User-Centric Design\nAt CES 2024, Ugreen has made a significant statement in the world of data storage by introducing its new NASync series. This foray marks Ugreen\u2019s expansion beyond its traditional scope of charging and accessories into the realm of Network Attached Storage (NAS), doing so with a flair for innovation and user engagement. The NASync device also targets regular consumers (rather than the enterprise-specific tech users that usually rely on network-attached storage) \u2013 this shift comes with its distinct benefits, as Ugreen highlighted in their keynote, talking about how the NASync could now become the iCloud or Google Drive alternative that you don\u2019t have to pay monthly subscriptions for\u2026 or the Netflix or Disney Plus streaming service that lets you play movies/media you own on any connected device anywhere.\nDesigner: Ugreen\nThe collaboration with Intel is a cornerstone of the NASync series, empowering these devices with Intel\u00ae processors. This partnership brings together Ugreen\u2019s expertise in HDD and SSD solutions and Intel\u2019s robust capabilities in cloud computing and PC components, creating a product that stands out for its technical excellence and user-friendly approach.\nThe integration of AI is a key highlight of the NASync series. This is a core component that transforms the NASync into an intelligent hub for digital activities. The AI in these devices is designed to adapt to user behaviors, streamlining tasks and offering personalized experiences. The NASync device can automatically read text within an image or a document, allowing you to then search for text WITHIN a file (like finding all invoices with a certain client\u2019s name). Ugreen\u2019s Hernan Lopez also demonstrated the ability to create visual tags, with the AI autonomously learning what different objects (or even faces) look like. For instance, you could create a tag for \u201cDrone\u201d and then visually search through your entire database for drone images, with the AI automatically understanding the visual archetype of a drone\u2019s design. It all happens locally, allowing you to build your own Google Image Search right within the comforts of your own home.\nUgreen has also placed a significant emphasis on the design of the NASync, ensuring it is approachable for a wide range of users. The focus on a user-friendly interface, both in the hardware\u2019s physical design and the software interaction, makes NASync an accessible yet powerful tool for anyone, regardless of their technical expertise. Easy hot-swappable drives allow users to add new HDDs or SSDs on demand, and if a drive fails, they can simply swap the old one out for a new one while still maintaining all their data on the NAS.\nThe NASync series stands as a powerful example of Ugreen\u2019s commitment to blending high-tech features with ease of use. It\u2019s a product that respects the user\u2019s need for simplicity without compromising on performance \u2013 ideal for managing large data sets, running AI algorithms, or effortlessly streaming 8K video.\nUgreen\u2019s entrance into the NAS market with the NASync series is reflective of the brand\u2019s evolution and its commitment to being at the forefront of technology. This series is a bold demonstration of Ugreen\u2019s ability to infuse cutting-edge technology into consumer-friendly products.\nAs we look at Ugreen\u2019s new venture at CES 2024, it\u2019s evident that the NASync series is more than a set of NAS devices; it\u2019s a harbinger of how integrated and intelligent technology can become a seamless part of our daily lives. The NASync isn\u2019t just about data storage; it represents a smarter, more intuitive way of interacting with our digital world.\nThe post Ugreen\u2019s NASync at CES 2024: Redefining Smart Storage with AI and User-Centric Design first appeared on Yanko Design.\nRelated Posts\nDesigners envision a stylish face mask to dive right into polluted air\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is behind us.

This development signifies a substantial leap forward. Empowered by Intel\u00ae processors, the new product lineup come with storage efficiency, and automated smart decision-making ability. With AI becoming more integrated into daily life, UGREEN and Intel are collaborating on more easy-to-use features, making daily work and life more convenient.\n\"With technology shifting more and more towards AI integration and related capabilities, we made the conscious decision to collaborate with a well-known, experienced institution to integrate these functions into our upcoming products,\" states UGREEN general manager Evan Li. \"We hope to introduce more customers to mere fractions of smart AI capabilities with the release of our\u00a0NASync devices.\"\nMore known for its revolutionary charging and accessories, UGREEN has made strides into the alternative energy source industry with the recent release of the PowerRoam Portable Power Station. Catapulting from that success, the UGREEN NASync series is meant to culminate Intel technical and hardware expertise in cloud computing and PC components, with\u00a0UGREEN's extensive knowledge in HDD and SSD storage solutions.\n\"Intel has a complete and mature solution system in the NAS field,\" states UGREEN product manager, Kris Wei, when asked about the collaboration. \"From entry-level needs to commercial fields, Intel provides key main control chips that make them the ideal first choice for cooperation.\"\nThe collaborative efforts have already begun to bare fruit, as UGREEN's product definition has incorporated many innovative designs in the consumer NAS field. Breakthroughs in areas like 8K video output, AI model computing power maximization and application are some examples of the practical benefits that have come from the team up. For more information on the UGREEN NASync series, please visit, https://nas.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-nas-storage-preheat.\nAbout Intel\nFounded in 1968, Intel is a multinational company and one of the world's largest semiconductor manufacturers.
