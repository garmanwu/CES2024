        "raw_content": "The Next Wave of Beauty Tech Just Dropped at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2024 in Las Vegas has once again emerged as a hub for revolutionary beauty technology, unveiling a spectrum of innovative devices poised to catapult our routines into the realm of futuristic luxury a la Judy Jetson. Notable among these launches are a multifunctional showerhead that serves as a face and body cleanser, a state-of-the-art lip tool and a strand-protecting blow dryer. These cutting-edge gadgets signify a shift towards a future that amplifies our self-care regimen. Here\u2019s a glimpse of the upcoming innovations set to grace our vanities before the robots take over.\n1. Elevating In-Shower Self-Care\nKohler is breaking into the beauty space big time with a number of offerings that are set to keep us in the bathroom longer. Our favorite is SpaViva, a multi-functional handshower that seamlessly combines innovative Kohler sprays with an all-in-one face and cleansing device. Featuring two spray types, a Katalyst and Microbubble spray, the device ensures a thorough and gentle cleanse. The interchangeable attachments include a face brush, body brush, body scrubber and body massager.\nAlfred Richardson, Kohler\u2019s director of channel marketing and commercialization says, \u201cIt introduces a unique environment of wellness and beauty into the shower. It underscores the idea that you can enjoy these spa-like activities in the comfort of your home without the need to always visit a spa.\u201d The SpaViva is equipped with an extendable handle, magnetic docking and a rechargeable battery offering a 90-minute run time.\n2. The Future of Lip Care\nAmorepacific\u2019s Lipcure Beam clinched the CES 2024 Innovation Award in the Digital Health category, marking the company\u2019s fifth consecutive victory. This all-in-one device not only identifies lip concerns but also provides treatment and leaves a custom tinted hue. The cap\u2019s precision sensor diagnoses lip conditions, while the brush-like applicator emits visible light to enhance lip care. The light-responsive material augments collagen fibers, establishing a moisturizing barrier on the lips.\nByung-Fhy Suh, head of Amorepacific R&I Center says, \u201cWe are profoundly honored that Amorepacific\u2019s renowned strengths in skin biotechnology and our dedicated research and development in customer-centric technology have led to us winning our fifth consecutive CES Innovation Award.\u201d\n3. Harnessing Light to Dry Hair\nL\u2019Oreal introduced the AirLight Pro, developed in collaboration with Zuvi, the brand behind the eco-friendly Halo tool. This professional-grade dryer utilizes infrared light and high-speed wind to dry surface water on strands, while retaining internal moisture. As a result, it leaves the hair up to 33 percent more hydrated while consuming 31 percent less energy. The dryer features a 17-blade, high-speed motor, and infrared technology, providing rapid drying without resorting to excessive heat. Barbara Lavernos, deputy CEO of L\u2019Oreal says, \u201cAirLight Pro perfectly encapsulates this beauty breakthrough by introducing a solution that not only dries hair but also cares for both the hair and the planet for the first time.\u201d\n4. Skin-Perfecting Tech\nThis year, APR brought their Medicube line of anti-aging tools from South Korea to CES for the first time. The company debuted its latest innovation, the Medicube Age-R Booster Pro, which launched oversees last October. Since its release abroad, the device has been a coveted for its ability to treat a variety of skin concerns and improve radiance, elasticity and tone and texture.\nThe Age-R Booster Pro uses electroporation technology and controlled lighting to treat skin. \u201cThrough this exhibition, we aim to establish APR\u2019s name as a leading beauty tech company in the global market and leave a lasting impression on consumers worldwide,\u201d says Kim Byung Hoon, CEO of APR. The device also connects to the Medicube Age-R app and offers personalized routines with remote control and automatic reporting features.\nAs beauty and technology continues to intertwine, these new devices showcase the industry\u2019s commitment to enhancing beauty rituals through cutting-edge advancements.\nRelated Posts\nIt's Personal\nAt NewBeauty, we get the most trusted information from the beauty authority delivered right to your inbox\nFind a NewBeauty \"Top Beauty Doctor\" Near you\nSign Up\nGet trusted information from the beauty authority delivered right to your inbox\nGlobal Headquarters"

        "raw_content": "Clarisonic co-founder launches new one-of-a-kind skincare device\nWith Clarisonic out of business, co-founder Dr. Robb Akridge is back with the next innovation in skincare: Opulus Beauty Labs.\nThe Opulus is the newest innovation from one of the creators behind Clarisonic.\nTo the dismay of much of the beauty world, in 2019 Clarisonic announced that the brand would no longer continue to make its iconic facial cleansing brushes. But one of the original founders of the brand, Dr. Robb Akridge, wasn't sitting still. Continuing with his long tradition of innovating in the beauty-meets-tech space, Akridge recently launched Opulus Beauty Labs, a first-of-its-kind skincare system that uses a special thermal blending technology to help potent skincare ingredients better absorb into the skin. The idea is that if you can get better absorption, then you'll get better results for the products you're slathering on day-after-day.\n\"I knew if I was going to create another brand it had to provide the consumer with something truly innovative: new and improved treatments both in skincare results and usage,\" Akridge tells CNET.\n\"The idea for our first innovation came to me in a beautiful over-the-top chocolate shop, where they had so many varieties of chocolate in terms of texture, shape and creativity. Most of the chocolates were individual morsels and each created an experience that you can only get at the time you bite into them. A light bulb went off and I thought, 'Why couldn't skincare be like this?'\" says Akridge.\nLike the individual chocolate bon bons you might buy at a specialty shop, the Opulus utilizes tiny Opoules, or individual pods that contain a custom skincare product blend. You pop them into the Opulus Activator appliance -- and they are single-use, kind of like the Nespresso pods of the skincare world. The activator heats and blends the ingredients using thermal blending technology (more on that later). Opoules are notably more sustainable than an espresso pod since there is no waste from the single use: the entire pod is heated and blended in the activator machine.\nSmall Opules containing skincare product are placed into the Opulus activator, which thermally blends the product.\nYou can purchase custom regimens to use with the Opulus activator based on your needs. \"The skin is changing all the time, and your needs in skincare are also changing; in fact, your needs in beauty as a whole are always changing,\" says Akridge.\nOne ingredient that's notably tricky to use is retinol, which the brand is focusing on with its initial skincare systems rollout. The retinol regimen comes in three different levels, which is supposed to gradually increase the dose of retinol you use over time to prevent irritation and other side-effects that you can get from using retinol. Whether you choose the 1, 2, or 3 level depends on how often you've used retinol before and how sensitive you are to the ingredient.\nThe idea is that each day your skincare system is laid out for you (you use one Opoule each day), and the brand strategically places \"recovery\" Opoules in your system depending on how often you will take a break from using the retinol.\nThe most important health tech of CES 2021\nHow does thermal blending work?\nAccording to Akridge, what truly sets the Opulus apart is the fact that the thermal blending technology allows the brand to combine skincare ingredients that you typically can't combine in normal skincare products or packaging.\n\"Many active ingredients aren't compatible in a cosmetic formula. In traditional cosmetic chemistry, there are often compromises that need to be made, when it comes to which ingredients can work well together and at what concentration, without causing degradation of the ingredients or separation due to incompatibility,\" says Akridge.\nThe other thing that Opulus can do that many other brands can't is formulate products without preservatives or fillers since the products are \"fresh,\" and used once.\n\"Because we are separating key ingredients in two formulation parts (the outer part of the Opoule, and the inner core), we can minimize or eliminate the use of preservatives, optimize ingredient concentration, and prevent the loss of potency, which may occur when these ingredients are combined and stored together for a long period of time,\" he says.\nThe thermal blending also heats the product, which is supposed to help the skin absorb it better as well.\nTo use the Opulus, you insert one of the pods, which the box separates individually into a daily schedule, into the Activator. Press the button on the device and wait as it thermally blends the product, and it's ready to apply in about 1 minute.\nWho is Opulus for?\nOpulus is definitely an investment, with a retail price of $495. The starter system includes the activator and one month of skincare, and once you use that you'll need to purchase an additional regimen monthly for $165.\nSerious skincare geeks (e.g., the person who has tried every product and wants more) or someone who is looking to invest in a quality retinol skincare system will appreciate this innovative system. Otherwise, the system is a serious investment (and an ongoing one), making it financially inaccessible to many people.\nAkridge says the Opulus is just the beginning of what he has planned for the beauty space. \"We started in skin treatment with retinol, as we saw this as a huge opportunity. But really, the sky's the limit for us. We see hair treatments and body treatment in our future,\" says Akridge.\nPersonal Care Guides\nEye Care\nDental Care\nMental Health\nOther Personal Care"

Our system transforms your skin with single-dose, freshly blended formulas\u2014delivering peak potency with every application.\nIronically, many combinations of topical skincare actives start degrading when stored in a prefixed formula, even though they work brilliantly together on the skin.\nThis is the case for many ingredients, such as retinol, allantoin, ceramides, vitamin C, etc.\nThe Opoule Treatment helps to solve the instability problem by isolating its active ingredients into two distinct parts\u2014the outer coat versus the interior core. Pop the Opoule into the Activator when you're ready to apply.\nOur mission is to bring results back into high performance beauty. That\u2019s why we go through a rigorous testing process to ensure the safety & efficacy of our products.\nWith each activation, you get a complete application that covers the face, neck and d\u00e9colletage and perhaps the backs of hands.\nThis is by design, as these areas often get neglected yet are all places that are exposed to sun, environment and therefore accelerated signs of aging.\nBecause Opoule Treatments are self-contained and made entirely out of skin care ingredients, there are no pods or plastics to toss after use.\nWhy try OPULUS Beauty Labs?\nHello!I\u2019m Dr. Robb (a.k.a.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nInnovations in beauty tech for 2024, from robot-powered nail art to AI-enhanced make-up\nInnovations in beauty tech took centre stage at CES 2024. Laura Feinstein reports for Wallpaper* on a selection of key trends to follow\nInnovations in beauty tech are taking centre stage in 2024, as proven at this year\u2018s annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES), the largest industry event of its kind. Here, thousands descended on Las Vegas to learn exactly what might be in store when it comes to the future of beauty and grooming. And, while AI and machine learning were the buzziest terms of 2023, judging by the many gadgets and products on display, tech is set to have an even bigger and more radical impact over the months ahead. Devices unveiled at CES 2024 range from algorithm-driven skin enhancements to at-home robots that seek to replace regular nail salon visits, tools that colour hair at the push of a button, and luxury storage systems developed with LVMH.\nInnovations in beauty tech for 2024, from robot-powered nail art to AI-enhanced make-up\nThe neuro-responsive scent\nScientists and researchers say scent recognition is one of our most potent cognitive tools, and putting this idea to the test is YSL Beauty\u2018s Scent-Sation, which utilises a multi-sensor EEG-based headset to gauge neural responses to luxury fragrances. An honoree for best Wearable Technology in CES 2024\u2019s Innovation Awards, the device allows you to craft their ideal scents by completing a questionnaire tied to a series of smell tests, with users given fragrance recommendations based on positive emotional responses.\nThe high-tech haircare\nThe L'Or\u00e9al Coloursonic can transform hair colour at the push of a button\nGrowing research suggests that the standard blow dryer is problematic for both the environment and hair health. At CES, L\u2018Oreal demonstrated an infrared-powered hairdryer, the AirLight Pro, which uses energy-efficient heating coils to dry strands while minimising heat damage. Developed with hardware start-up Zuvi, creator of the revolutionary Halo hairdryer, the device features 17 propeller blades and offers faster drying time, leaving hair more hydrated while consuming less energy. The brand also unveiled its Coloursonic at-home hair dyeing wand, which can seamlessly mix and distribute salon-quality formulas at the push of a button. On the more experimental side, Korea\u2018s Becon.ai introduced the Scalp Scanner \u2013 which promises to be the future in preventing hair loss and seeks to encourage overall scalp nutrition \u2013 while Myavana offered at-home AI-driven strand testing with personalised scientific analysis and recommendations.\nThe AI and AR make-up\nThe Amorepacific Lipcure Beam was an honoree in the CES 2024 Innovation Awards for Digital Health\nThe Amorepacific Lipcure Beam \u2013 a CES 2024 Innovation Award honoree for Digital Health, for its patented technology combining lip care with customised make-up \u2013 is akin to a handheld beauty consultant. The device works via a precision sensor in the tool\u2018s cap to detect moisture levels and skin condition when grazed over lips. The applicator then utilises a brush that emits a high-tech \u2018visible light\u2018 based on diagnostic results, projecting light-activated material that boosts natural collagen, forms a moisturising barrier, and creates a custom hue. The brand also unveiled COSMECHIP, an at-home device that curates custom skincare, and Color Master by TONEWORK, which uses AI and \u2018precision colour analysis\u2018 to recommend make-up shades based on skin tone and texture.\nThe luxury beauty storage\nThe Beautygloo cosmetics fridge has been developed in Paris with LVMH and counts Dior Beauty and Shiseido as customers\nFrench brand Beautygloo hopes to extend the shelf life of your favourite products and fragrances with a revamped cosmetics fridge with a patented cooling system to maintain optimal preservation temperatures, all while eliminating humidity. The start-up\u2019s product was developed in Paris as part of an LVMH accelerator programme, and current Beautygloo customers include Dior and Shiseido. In the coming year, the brand seeks to make headway in the US market.\nThe robot-enhanced nail and brow treatments\nThe Nimble Beauty at home nail salon uses AI and robotics to paint and dry nails like a professional artist\nA standout at CES 2024, Nimble Beauty\u2018s \u2018smart at-home nail salon\u2018 makes use of AI and robotics to paint and dry professional-quality nails in 33 vegan shades, using nail-scanning technology. Nails are inserted into a device similar to a typical gel manicure kit. Then, they are mapped by more than 20 algorithms that calculate exact polish needs, while painting is done via a robotic arm programmed to mimic human motions. Shu Uemura also hopes to replace your next salon appointment with its newly unveiled SHU: BROW, an at-home electronic eyebrow make-up applicator. Built with the help of Prinker, a pioneer in the temporary body ink space, the device offers bespoke, tech-enabled brow shaping tailored to a user\u2018s exact face dimensions.\nThe new skincare devices\nThe Armani Beauty METAPROFILER is a handheld face sculpting device that analysis skin\nFans of Armani Beauty can look forward to the brand\u2018s META PROFILER, a handheld face sculpting and massaging device equipped with cutting-edge technology that is able to analyse skin with a combination of 18 LEDs. Three capture modes are also able to identify texture, smoothness and even levels of hydration. Working in this space alongside Armani Beauty is cult Korean skincare favourite Medicube, which announced plans to bring its popular Booster Pro (a facial tool designed to amplify radiance and elasticity through microcurrents and light therapy) to global audiences later this year.\nThe bathroom of the future\nThe Kohler Anthem+ Digital Control system is part of the \u2018bathroom of the future\u2018 alongside its Atmo Bathroom Fan\nKohler is entering into hackable bathrooms in a big way with its range of new smart home products. Coming soon, the Anthem+ Digital Control system can power almost any bathroom from a single control panel, equipping showers with the ability to regulate flow and temperature and adding steam through a touch display that syncs with the Kohler Konnect app. The SpaViva, another addition to the collection, is a multi-functional hand shower that combines an all-in-one face and body cleansing device with interchangeable brushes, massagers, and pulsing sprays. As part of this \u2018bathroom of the future\u2018, Kohler will also release the programmable Atmo Bathroom Fan later this year, which uses sensors to modify temperature and doubles as a light, automatically coming to life when too much moisture is present.\nWallpaper* Newsletter\nReceive our daily digest of inspiration, escapism and design stories from around the world direct to your inbox\nLaura\u00a0Feinstein\u00a0is Kickstarter\u2019s Senior Design & Tech Editor.

The\u00a0device reportedly combines lip diagnosis, care and makeup capabilities in one unit.\nIts cap houses a\u00a0 sensor capable of diagnosing the condition of the lips, including moisture levels. The cap can be removed to reveal a brush-like makeup applicator that deposits a light-responsive material to the lips and a customized visible light that can, in combination with the material, boost\u00a0the response of riboflavin.\nThis reaction between the light and the deposited material reportedly strengthens the collagen fibers inside the lips, forming a moisturizing barrier on the surface. The result is slowed lip aging, per Amorepacific.\nThe design supports one-handed application and \"employs a universal color system naturally suited for all races and ages.\"\nByung-Fhy Suh, head of Amorepacific's R&I center, said, \"We are profoundly honored that Amorepacific's renowned strengths in skin biotechnology and our dedicated research and development in customer-centric technology have led to us winning our fifth consecutive CES Innovation Award.

Ahead, we\u2019ve rounded up some of the best beauty finds from CES 2024 that are worth buying (or keeping your eyes on) \u2014 see our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Fashion & Beauty\nDreame AirStyle High-Speed Styler\nAt $299, the soon-to-launch Dreame AirStyle is one of the best affordable hair multi-stylers we\u2019ve seen \u2014 and we expect it to compete with the beloved Dyson Airwrap, which costs twice the price.During our hands-on demo at CES, the hair tool base felt as light \u2014 if not lighter \u2014 than the Airwrap, and even lighter and easier to use than the Shark FlexStyle (the current top-selling Dyson hair tool competitor right now). It offered many of the same features as both the Dyson and Shark hair tools: three speed settings and a cold shot button for setting hairstyles.Accessories include two curlers (clockwise and counterclockwise) that look and feel similar to Dyson\u2019s 1.2-inch barrels, a flyaway tool, a round volumizer brush, a smoothing brush and a hair smoother. It also has a removable filter cover and automatic temperature monitoring. While testing the hair styler at CES, we found that the curling barrels wrapped hair as seamlessly as our Airwrap at home. The final test: bringing our newly-styled tresses \u2014 finished by Dreame\u2019s on-site hairstylist with a spritz of hair spray \u2014 back to the hotel room to see how well our strands held their shape the next morning. After (literally) sleeping on the results, we can confidently say that Dreame\u2019s AirStyle is poised to be the next big thing in the world of Airwrap alternatives. It\u2019s slated to hit the market this summer at\u00a0Amazon\u00a0and Dreame\u2019s website.

At CES 2024, we saw Imprintu\u2019s pocket-sized device in action and nearly expected the \u201ctattooist\u201d to declare, \u201cAbracadabra!\u201d Made to last about a day (our body art stood the test of 24 hours in Vegas), the tattoos looked vibrant and clear on our olive-tone skin. Imprintu says the device can also be used to print designs on clothing, too.\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Colorsonic Hair Brush\nAfter being announced at CES 2022, L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s groundbreaking Colorsonic was finally unveiled \u2014 with the help of actress and brand ambassador Eva Longoria \u2014 at CES 2024 during the company\u2019s first-ever keynote at the tech showcase. The magic wand-like hair-dying brush uses color cartridges to make it easier \u2013 and stain-free \u2014 to color tresses or touch up roots.One cartridge can be applied to a full head or be used for three root retouches. Unfinished cartridges can also be saved in the device to be used later. Initially, there will be 20 hydrating shades available in formulas free of ammonia, parabens, phthalates, SLS, SLES and silicones.The L\u2019Or\u00e9al Colorsonic will launch this spring.\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al x Zuvi AirLight Pro Hair Dryer\nWe\u2019re already fans of Zuvi\u2018s Halo hair dryer, which uses the company\u2019s revolutionary LightCare technology to prevent heat damage on tresses or an overheated scalp by using infrared light instead of heat \u2014 a process so innovative that CES 2024 keynote speaker L\u2019Or\u00e9al became a strategic investor of the brand. The result of their partnership is the professional-grade AirLight Pro, which L\u2019Or\u00e9al says uses 31 percent less energy than other hair dryers and delivers up to 33 percent more hydrated hair and up to 59 percent smoother-looking strands. The Zuvi AirLight Pro hair dryer will launch under L\u2019Or\u00e9al Professionel later this year to both consumers and beauty professionals.\nBeautigloo Beauty Refrigerator\nCold storage isn\u2019t news in the beauty world, but LVMH- and L\u2019Or\u00e9al-backed French company Beautigloo offers a better way to organize your skin-care (and without the gimmicky mini-fridge silhouette) with its new Lite Refrigerated Beauty Box, which has a built-in thermostat, customizable compartments and a roomy interior that allows you to store bottles upright. Featuring a 5-liter capacity (a larger size is available), the beauty refrigerator uses a silent cooling system and keeps products at the ideal temperature of 50 degrees Fahrenheit for preserving ingredients and extending shelf-life. (The Paris-based startup says that Dior and Shiseido are among clients.)\nPanasonic Palm Shaver\nGrooming on the go just got easier with Panasonic\u2019s Palm Shaver, a pocket-friendly device equipped with a five-blade system for smooth, close shaves for all beard textures. We love that the tool is made from sea mineral-derived Nagori, a sustainable material that Panasonic says helps reduce plastic usage by 40 percent compared to conventional grooming products. The tool will launch in September.\nAmore Pacific Lipcure Beam\nA winner of the CES 2024 Innovation Award in Digital Health, Korean beauty giant Amore Pacific\u2019s Lipcure Beam is a pout care multi-tasker that diagnoses, plumps and applies lip makeup. Using a specially formulated gel-like material (which is applied to the lips) that responds to light exposure, the three-in-one applicator senses and treats lip concerns by activating riboflavin, a natural vitamin, to \u201cstrengthen the collagen fibers in the lips\u201d to form a moisturizing barrier. No word yet on the release date, but beauty lovers will likely want to stay tuned on this kisser care and tinting device.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nPrince Harry Pulls Libel Claim Against British Tabloid Mail on Sunday\nEvents of the Week: \u2018Vanderpump Rules,\u2019 \u2018Law & Order: SVU\u2019 and More\nCritics Choice Red Carpet Winners Revealed: Margot Robbie\u2019s $2.5M Balmain Look, Charles Melton in Valentino\nRambling Reporter: Selena Gomez Can\u2019t Stop Quitting Instagram\nThe Gamble of Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s Career (Exclusive Excerpt)\nCara Delevingne, South Korean Model Xu Meen Make a Case for Digital Nomad Style in MCM\u2019s New Campaign\nMost Popular\nMeghan Markle & Prince Harry Are Reportedly 'Shocked' Over the Controversy Surrounding Daughter Lilibet's Name\nThe Egyptian Government Bulldozed an Iconic Cairo Art Center With \u2018Millions\u2019 in Art Inside\nKobe-Inspired Mamba Foundation Amasses Cash but Spends Little\nMo'Nique Blames Oprah For Taraji P.

        "raw_content": "The Spotlight on Beauty Tech at CES 2024\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al will be the first beauty company to deliver a keynote address at CES. CEO Nicolas Hieronimus will expound upon the need for accessibility in beauty tech, and what L\u2019Or\u00e9al is doing about it.\nIs there any better way to kick off the New Year than observing the newest trends and innovations unveiled at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES)? Organized by The Consumer Technology Association, the annual trade show has established itself as one of the biggest tech events of the year for brands, manufacturers and companies looking to demonstrate the latest products and technologies from IoT and AI to wearables and smart homes. CES is the place for anyone looking to make business happen, and to be in the know about the hottest gadgets, devices and technologies of the year across the consumer electronics (CE) sector.\nThis year, CES is taking place in Las Vegas from Jan. 9-12. Highlighted exhibitors for CES 2024 include big names such as\u00a0 Google, Hyundai, LG, Mercedes-Benz, Samsung and Sony. The theme for 2024 is \u2018All Together. All ON\u2019, and it is meant to underscore the ways technology and innovators around the world can unite to improve lives.\nThis theme comes on the heels of the Sept. 18 UN conference about the next phase of the Human Security for All (HS4A) campaign. The event, co-hosted by the UN Trust Fund for Human Security, CTA and the World Academy of Art and Science (WAAS), witnessed CTA president and CEO Gary Shapiro communicating the status of technology as a human necessity. Also at the event, the CTA announced that technology would become the eighth pillar of the HS4A campaign.\nOf the announcement, Shapiro had to say, \u201cTechnology is making our world a better place to live for literally billions of people, and we are only just scratching the surface of what\u2019s possible.\u201d The addition of technology to the HS4A campaign served as the perfect segue into CES 2024, which Shapiro remarked would be a launch point to \u201cshowcase the innovations that transform our world \u2013 at CES 2024 and beyond.\u201d\nA Year for Bolstering Beauty Tech\nIn 2024, beauty tech is set to have a notable presence on both the big stage and the show floor. CES 2024 looks to be one for the books as it will be the first time a beauty company is represented among the keynote speakers at the tech trade show.\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al, one of the leading beauty companies in the world, has long been a staple exhibitor at CES, showcasing innovations that have bridged the gap between the beauty and tech industries for nearly a decade. The company\u2019s consumer technology prototypes exhibited at CES have included the AI-enabled customized skincare device Perso (CES 2020), the automatic hair-coloring device Colorsonic (CES 2022), the 3D eyebrow printer L\u2019Or\u00e9al Brow Magic and the computerized makeup applicator HAPTA (CES 2023).\nAccording to a press release from the CTA, Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO of L\u2019Or\u00e9al and keynote speaker, will be at CES 2024 highlighting \u201cthe role that sustainable, accessible and inclusive beauty tech plays in driving positive impact at an individual and collective level.\u201d Beauty, makeup, and skincare are powerful tools of self-expression that can serve as a confidence and self-esteem booster for anyone who uses them. As evidenced by the UN\u2019s HS4A campaign, technology is another powerful tool that can do good when designed with the right purpose in mind.\nIn its keynote, L\u2019Or\u00e9al seeks to demonstrate how it is combining the possibilities of beauty and the capabilities of tech to improve people\u2019s lives. Hieronimus cosigns this sentiment, stating in the CTA press release, \u201cL\u2019Or\u00e9al envisions a future where no one feels left out by beauty trends, because they will have the power to create their own trends \u2013 whenever, wherever \u2013 with products and tools inspired by their own stories, experiences and identity.\u201d\nThe Future of Beauty Tech is Inclusive and Accessible\nAccessibility and inclusivity are prominent themes at CES 2024 and L\u2019Or\u00e9al. The beauty company has been at the forefront of melding tech with accessibility through its Technology Incubator in its research and development division.\nThe Incubator started in 2012 and has grown into a team of more than 30 \u201cphysicists, engineers, UX specialists, hardware designers and data scientists working cross-functionally to help L\u2019Or\u00e9al evolve from the world\u2019s foremost beauty company to a technology player that is empowering consumers through personalized products and experience.\u201d This includes making beauty tech that is accessible and inclusive for disabled people.\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al unveiled the HAPTA makeup applicator at CES 2023. The computerized makeup applicator is designed for people with limited fine motor skills and hand-motion disorders, which can be the result of arthritis, Huntington\u2019s Disease, stroke and additional conditions. HAPTA utilizes motion stabilization to counteract unintended movement and keep the device level, assisting people \u201cwho may find it difficult to get a comfortable angle when applying lipstick or mascara.\u201d\nMany beauty tools and application methods are not designed for disabled people despite the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) indicating that 27 percent of adults in the U.S. have some type of disability. Around 12 percent of the population have disabilities affecting their mobility, so beauty tech such as HAPTA is incredibly useful and transformative.\nGuive Balooch, L\u2019Or\u00e9al Global Head of Research and Innovation\u2019s Tech Incubator, called innovations such as HAPTA \u201cassistive beauty\u201d in a L\u2019Or\u00e9al Groupe press release. He elaborates that this facet of beauty tech means \u201csolving for consumers\u2019 challenges and removing barriers to achieving desired results\u201d they would not otherwise get without extensive training or makeup applicators not designed with disabled people in mind.\n\u201c[HAPTA] is pretty incredible in that regard,\u201d Brian Comiskey, Director of Thematic Programs at CTA, remarked to Dealerscope. \u201cEveryone deserves the confidence that makeup can provide, so I\u2019m very excited to see what L\u2019Or\u00e9al might have to say about the continuation of that story.\u201d\u00a0 According to GWI, \u201cBeauty buyers are 18 percent more likely than the average American to have self-confidence issues as a result of longer-term medical conditions.\u201d Consumers want more inclusive and accessible products as well. GWI notes that 37 percent of U.S. beauty buyers say disabled people deserve better representation in products and services.\nTech innovations from beauty giants like L\u2019Or\u00e9al launched on a stage as influential as CES can lead by example in terms of what disability representation should look like in the beauty and tech industries.\nThe Exciting World of Wearable Tech in Medical Applications\nReliefband Flex\u2019s Solution to Motion Sickness and Nausea\nApplications of Real-Time Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGMs)\nFalconFrames Join the Sports Wearables Revolution\nSmart Watches Can Help Predict Parkinson\u2019s Disease\nConsumer Electronics Join the Roster with Partnerships\nSubtlety is Out,Statements Are In\nErgoAV to Display Solutions Designed to Revolutionize Workspaces at CES 2024\nConsumer Electronics Join the Roster with Partnerships\nSubtlety is Out,Statements Are In\nErgoAV to Display Solutions Designed to Revolutionize Workspaces at CES 2024"

The idea came about in a Paris chocolate shop in which you have these individual bite-sized morsels, each one having its own experience with it, whether it\u2019s cream or chocolate filling, or whatever it is.\nBut that\u2019s isn't where it stopped. When I could have said \"I\u2019m going to create cosmetics so it can come from a jar or tub where you have it for three months,\"\u200b you could actually create something that\u2019s customizable for each person everyday, because your skin is changing everyday.\nThe \u200bOpoule\u200b\u00a0allows us to do so many other things than just come up with a cosmetic chocolate, if you would. It\u2019s actually allowed us to separate ingredients so we can have a different carrier on the outside, like triglycerides and certain actives in that, and then the core of the Opoule\u00a0itself we can have other ingredients.\nThat allows us to keep them suspended and separated until the moment of use, when we active them with the activator, and that peek potency is required so consumers can get a better experience out of it, because at the end it\u2019s all about the benefit to the consumers. It\u2019s not just about creating something that\u2019s different and people don\u2019t know what it is.\nThat\u2019s the carrying system is really multifaceted because we can change the outside chemistry and the inside chemistry to create everything from serums, moisturizers, face masks, hair treatment, body treatment, you name it. We can do that and with all those different carriers in ways that utilize the cosmetic chemistry in this little quote-unquote\u00a0\"bite-sized\" Opoule.\nA post shared by OPULUS Beauty Labs (@opulusbeautylabs)\nCan you tell me more about what this carrying system solves in cosmetics\nWell it depends on how you break it down.\nFirst of all, the overarching thing is that we\u2019re creating a new way to look at cosmetics instead of your traditional long timeline distribution channel, so you don't get it manufactured in a big plant and then it takes so many months to get to the actual consumer before it\u2019s used.\u00a0This actually allows consumers to get freshly activated beauty on-demand because we have these individual chemistries, the Opoules.\nThe other thing is that we try to reduce plastic, so on the sustainability side it\u2019s another problem we\u2019re solving, reducing the amount of plastic. Obviously the activator has plastic, but it lasts for years, it\u2019s not like you\u2019re throwing it away every three months.\nThe other thing is consumers don\u2019t really realize that a lot of the actives they\u2019re using are working because they give up, because they get very frustrating, because they\u2019re very powerful ingredients, things like retinol. We decided we\u2019d go ahead and approach that first because retinol is a great ingredient but people have all kinds of issues with it and they say \"oh it\u2019s not for me because it irritated my skin or made it dry or red,\"\u200b but we figured out a way to solve that problem.\nIt's solving problems everywhere from the corporate level down the the individual consumers experience.\nWhat has the consumer response been to the product?\u200b\nAmazing. That\u2019s the great thing is people use it and they feel their skin is hydrated.\nWhen we do studies in house we use it for four weeks and they can see improvement of hydration in the skin and improvement of fine lines, more even skin tone. All those things you dream of as a manufacturer to create for your consumer, it\u2019s happening, so people love it.\nHow scalable do you see this system being?\nVery scalable. First of all it\u2019s a new innovation in cosmetics. I could not find anybody in the contract manufacturing world who wanted to make the little Opoules, they said \"why would we want to do that when we\u2019re basically filling up a jar and putting a label on it and it\u2019s good to go.\"\u200b So we had to go out and get our own production line.\nHaving said that, the processes we use are very similar to what exists in the confectionary world. If you think of Godiva chocolate, it\u2019s all over the world. It\u2019s the same thing. Opulus Beauty Labs could be all over the world. It\u2019s very scalable.\nWe talked at Suppliers\u2019 Day about how this system make ingredients that don\u2019t usually don\u2019t want to play nicely together work together in a product. Can you tell me more about that?\nWhen you look at the consumer, they\u2019re really into layering. They like to put on different layers because they have a vision that they can\u2019t mix them ahead of time because they become inactivated or bound up or precipitated out, so they layer on.\u00a0That\u2019s actually not the best thing either because you have to decide how to layer.\nWhat we were able to do keep the ingredients separated until the moment in which they\u2019re crushed, heated and blended together to allow them to be put on immediately, so they don\u2019t have a chance to change over time. Where as a traditional cosmetic chemist has to think about \"okay, I mixed these actives together how long are they going to last in this jar,\u200b\" we have them separated and we blend them at the last second.\nDoes that mean you\u2019re using a different preservative system?\nYes. When you look at traditional cosmetic systems, the first ingredient is water in a lot of them.\u00a0Historically, whenever I\u2019ve been doing science, and I\u2019m an actual scientist, I look at other areas of research other than my own to get ideas on how to create something new.\nIf you look at the food industry, they measure the amount of water activity in their formulation, meaning how much free water is available. There\u2019s actually a machine that can do that, and based on the amount of free water or active water, they can adjust the preservative to account for that and then take care of the microbes, because free water or active water is where the microbes grow.\u00a0It\u2019s also the place for generating oxygen radicals.\nSo what we\u2019ve done, we either don\u2019t have water, which is what we\u2019ve done in the an-hydras yellow retinol, so we don\u2019t have to worry about the additional preservatives being added. Then in our RHR, that one has water in it, but we\u2019ve measured the activity and it\u2019s bound up, so we\u2019ve made sure there is not free water so we don\u2019t have to add additional preservatives.\nA post shared by OPULUS Beauty Labs (@opulusbeautylabs)\nWho do you see being the ideal consumer for this product?\nAnyone who used skin care. Just like Sonicare or Clarisonic, anyone that has teeth or anyone who has skin can use this product. Y\nYou have to start somewhere as a start up. We have a huge heritage, but we\u2019re really starting over. L'oreal\u00a0bought Clarisonic in 2011, I worked for them for six years, and now we have a really small team, and we had to focus somewhere and right now its skin treatment. We\u2019re looking at people who use retinol or want to use retinol, that\u2019s our target market. We also know other skin treatments are needed by consumers, and we\u2019ll be rolling those out in 2022.\nWhat is the next step for Opulus?\nWe have this particular cadence where you start in one with retinol and RHR and then retinol, and you build up your tolerance overtime, but then there's also things like facemasks. We\u2019re actually having a new system where we\u2019re coming out with duel purpose Opoules, one is blended up, then another goes on top of it to give you a new reaction, and then you can basically combine them and get a new result. The next thing will be skin treatments.\nWhat else do industry professionals need to know about this system and this product?\nThe main thing is that this is totally different than anything they\u2019ve seen. The challenge we\u2019ve always had in talking about Clarisonic with other people who make cosmetic products is they really don\u2019t know what it is and they sort of poo-poo it because it's new on the market and they don\u2019t really understand.\nI would ask them to have an open mind and listen to our technology and what we have to offer. This particular system, the Opoules and activators, it can be licensed to other brands. If they have a unique ingredient, we can create Opoules and label it under there name and then create their own activators in the future.\nWe have to make sure the consumer is educated, as someone said earlier, this in not a tube of lipsticks, they need to know what to do with it. We have to tell people this is a new way to look at your skin care, and its very simple to use.\nCopyright - Unless otherwise stated all contents of this web site are \u00a9 2024 - William Reed Ltd - All Rights Reserved - Full details for the use of materials on this site can be found in the Terms & Conditions\nRelated topics\nBrand Innovation\nFormulation & Science\nMarket Trends\nSkin Care\nRelated news\nShow more\nRelated products\nHow Nutricosmetics Can Enhance Skin Beauty\nContent provided by Activ'Inside | 11-Dec-2023\n| White Paper\nIn the ever-evolving realm of nutricosmetics, where inner wellness meets outer beauty, few natural ingredients have captured the spotlight quite like grapes.\nUltimate Antimicrobial Solution for BPC\nContent provided by Acme-Hardesty Company | 11-Oct-2023\n| White Paper\nSharomix\u2122 EG10, a versatile broad-spectrum antimicrobial liquid blend for preserving personal care products, ensures safety at usage levels ranging from...\nAcme-Hardesty Expands Product Line into Canada\nContent provided by Acme-Hardesty Company | 07-Jul-2023\n| Product Brochure\nAcme-Hardesty\u2019s latest expansion into Canada includes Resplanta\u00ae, Botaneco\u00ae, and BYK from our partners Sharon Personal Care and Eckart Effect Pigments...\nCreate gentler, eco-friendly personal care\nContent provided by Covation Bio\u2122 PDO | 22-Jun-2023\n| White Paper\nZemea\u00ae propanediol is a 100% plant-based humectant and solvent that\u2019s easy on skin and the planet.

A nine-time CES Innovation Award honoree, L'Or\u00e9al's keynote will demonstrate how the company's ongoing technology transformation ensures that it remains prepared for a future of its business that is at once physical, digital and virtual.\nL'Or\u00e9al CEO Nicolas Hieronimus will deliver the first-ever keynote from a beauty company at CES\u00ae 2024.\nL'Or\u00e9al's keynote will showcase the role that sustainable, accessible and inclusive beauty tech plays in driving positive impact at an individual and collective level, from a sustainable showerhead that leverages rocket technology to conserve water and AI-powered mobile applications that provide skincare guidance to augmented reality makeup try-ons and new codes and forms of beauty expression in virtual environments. L'Or\u00e9al knows that technology, powered by advanced data and AI capabilities, is an essential tool for creating powerful new connections and experiences for its consumers by solving their long-standing beauty challenges and offering them limitless tools for discovery, self-expression and personalization.\n\"Beauty is a timeless pursuit and technology adds to its enjoyment while unlocking a world of possibilities,\" said Nicolas Hieronimus, CEO, L'Or\u00e9al Groupe. \"The first wave of beauty tech changed how people discover, evaluate and buy beauty products. More recently, we've seen how it can better serve the underserved, by democratizing skin health and\u202fincreasing access to self-expression\u202fthrough innovations like HAPTA for people with limited arm mobility. This is just the beginning. L'Or\u00e9al envisions a future where no one feels left out by beauty trends, because they will have the power to create their own trends \u2013 whenever, wherever \u2013 with products and tools inspired by their own stories, experiences and identity.\"\nL'Or\u00e9al, which has unveiled new consumer technology at CES every year for nearly a decade, released its inclusive beauty tech innovation HAPTA at CES 2023. The world's first handheld computerized makeup applicator, this motion-stabilizing device assists those who have difficulty raising their arms due to limited mobility issues, people with limited grip strength, and anyone with limited wrist mobility who may find it difficult to get a comfortable angle when applying lipstick or mascara.\n\"We are thrilled to welcome our first beauty company to the keynote stage to highlight innovation in the beauty tech category,\" said Gary Shapiro, president and CEO, Consumer Technology Association. \"L'Or\u00e9al has a powerful story to tell of its vision for what's next for beauty, and how technology enables it to meet the needs of its consumers and outperform the beauty industry today and prepare it for the consumer revolutions of the future.\"\nEarlier award-winning highlights from L'Or\u00e9al at CES include wearables for detecting one's individual exposure to the sun's harmful rays and handheld devices that dispense personalized makeup and haircolor at home. Over the years, L'Or\u00e9al has built a powerful global ecosystem of technology partnerships with startups, tech powerhouses and academic institutions, has invested billions in its in-house research and innovation capabilities, and invested in a worldwide network of startups through its Open Innovation model, through startup accelerators like Station F in France and through its BOLD venture capital fund.\nLOGISTICS: Nicolas Hieronimus speaks following the CTA State of the Industry Address at 8:30 a.m. PT on January 9, 2024, in the Palazzo Ballroom at the Venetian.\nFor the latest information on CES 2024, visit CES.tech.\nAbout CES:\u00a0CES\u00ae is the most powerful tech event in the world \u2013 the proving ground for breakthrough technologies and global innovators.
