Subscribe now.\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Terms of Use and Policies You may unsubscribe at any time.\nDutch company Squad Mobility wants to offer Mobility-as-a-Service, and it is showcasing its two-person solar-powered electric vehicle (EV), Squad, at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. The displayed vehicle is a prototype with production slated to start later this year.\nIt is not uncommon to see a single occupant in a large car. On busy roads, the car occupies more space than is needed for an individual, an issue that compounds as the number of cars increases. Cities worldwide are facing this problem, prompting the adoption of mass transit systems, which also help curb pollution.\nWith the increasing popularity of electric vehicles (EVs), the pollution issue may be addressed, but large-sized vehicles remain. To pack more range into the EV, manufacturers are installing larger battery packs, further increasing the vehicle's size. Breda-Netherlands-based company Squad Mobility hopes to break this trend in the automotive sector with its small solar-powered EV, Squad.\nA small car for big cities\nAccording to the company, the integrated solar panel of the roof of the Squad can add about 13 miles (22 km) of range on a sunny day in the Netherlands. In brighter areas like Las Vegas, this could increase to a little over 19 miles (31 km). The four swappable batteries on the solar-powered vehicle can deliver a range of 62 miles (100 km).\nPut together, the company is confident that for regular use, such as commuting to the office or picking up groceries, one would not need to charge the Squad at all. For users looking for a little more space, Squad Mobility plans a slightly larger version, the L7, which could seat up to two children in the rear or be used for cargo or bags.\nThe four-kilowatt motor on the vehicle delivers about 28 miles (45 km) an hour, which is ideal for a city ride. The vehicle comes with an Aluminium Tubular Roll Cage with a full front and rear crash structure.\nThe flatpack model distribution\nThe Squad will be available for deliveries in 2025 and can now be pre-booked for as little as $50. The full price of the solar car with two batteries and 31 miles (50 km) range is $6250 but does not include doors or air conditioning. The price of the car with these add-ons is $9,300.\nAccording to its website, Squad Mobility will first begin deliveries in the Netherlands and then head east and south. The company plans to use the distributed micro-factory model to set up assembly facilities closer to the customer.\nUsing this approach, instead of shipping a wholly assembled car overseas, Squad Mobility will ship some components while sourcing others locally to reduce the environmental impact of producing the car. The company said this will also improve the availability of spares on its website.\nIn the future, the company wants to offer its vehicles as a service to golf cart communities, (company) campuses, hotels and resorts, and amusement parks as a service."

The company, established in Amsterdam in 2019, is on the brink of revolutionizing urban mobility with its cost-effective and eco-friendly solutions. As the anticipation for its 2025 production launch grows, the company prepares to showcase a special Buggy edition at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, offering a glimpse into the future of micro-electric vehicles (microEVs).\nSquad Mobility was founded by Robert Hoevers and Chris Klok, both of whom have a rich background in sustainable automotive design, notably with the Lightyear One solar-electric vehicle. Their latest venture focuses on a smaller, more affordable approach to clean urban transportation. The unveiling of the Squad Solar two-seater last year marked a significant milestone in their journey, offering a budget-friendly option for eco-conscious city dwellers.\nPriced competitively at \u20ac6,250, the Squad Solar two-seater, and its more upscale Signature Edition at \u20ac9,300, have remained consistent in their pre-order phase. The initial batch of Europe-exclusive vehicles, the Signature Edition, is equipped with four batteries, boasting a range of 100 km (62 miles) per charge. This initial offering sets a high standard for what is to follow.\nSquad Mobility\u2019s Pioneer Edition, priced at \u20ac7,050, is slated for the next 900 models. These units will feature two batteries, offering roughly half the range of the Signature Edition. Additionally, a regular production pre-order level is available, along with an option for customers outside the EU. For U.S. customers, the estimated availability is set for 2025, with a price tag of $6,250, excluding taxes.\nThe company\u2019s CEO, Hoevers, noted a significant interest from the U.S., particularly in sectors like golf cart communities, corporate campuses, sharing platforms, hotels and resorts, amusement parks, and inner city services. This interest underlines the versatility and wide-ranging appeal of the Solar City microEV.\nThe Solar City is aptly named, featuring a rooftop equipped with 250 Wp of photovoltaic cells. This design allows for an additional daily range of up to 22 km in sunny conditions, like those found in the Netherlands, or 19.2 miles under Las Vegas\u2019s sunnier skies. This feature could potentially negate the need for charging for some commuters.\nEach Solar City vehicle can accommodate up to four 1.6-kWh Li-ion batteries, achieving a maximum range of 100 km. The batteries are swappable, and the vehicle includes 168 liters of storage space. The prospect of battery swap stations in the future further enhances the practicality of this vehicle.\nThe microEV\u2019s performance specifications are equally impressive. It features two in-wheel motors at the rear, offering power options of 2 kW or 3 kW each. Depending on the model, the top speeds vary \u2013 45 km/h under the L6e or L7 homologation in Europe and up to 25 mph in the U.S. as an LSV.\nSafety is not an afterthought in the Solar City design. The vehicle boasts an aluminum space frame with a roll cage, crash protection, safety belts on all seats, and disc brakes at each wheel. Doors are optional for the standard model destined for the U.S. market.\nThe Buggy version, which sets itself apart with a tubular barrier on each side, a rear rack, and special wheels and tires, offers a more rugged and versatile option. All Buggy accessories will be available for separate order.\nLooking ahead, Squad Mobility is prioritizing the production of the two-person L6/LSV and L7 models. However, plans for a four-person L7 model and a cargo version are in the works, expanding the utility of the Solar City range. A standard two-battery Solar City LSV microEV is priced at $6,250 before tax in the U.S., positioning it as an accessible option for a wide range of consumers.\nAs Squad Mobility gears up for its display at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, its Solar Buggy and the broader Solar City line represent not just a new product but a new paradigm in urban transportation. With its focus on sustainability, affordability, and practicality, Squad Mobility is poised to make a significant impact on how we navigate our cities in the coming years.\nSource: Squad Mobility\nExploring the charm of the Carice TC2: A nostalgic electric convertible\nExploring the VW Dog Camper: A canine-friendly travel solution\nTonke VW ID.

        "raw_content": "Squad Mobility\u2019s tiny solar-powered EV is a dream for crowded cities\nIt\u2019s beefier than a golf cart, but not by much.\nEVs, like me after the holidays, have a tendency to bloat at the slightest provocation, which is why I can\u2019t fit into those size 34 jeans. The big issue for electric cars is heavy batteries force cars to grow in size to accommodate them. Of course, the heavier the load, the more power is needed to keep going, forcing you into a vicious cycle. Even a small city car like the original Smart has, in its latest electric version, grown into a grotesque parody of its predecessor. Which is why there\u2019s a lot of hope riding on truly small EVs, like Squad Mobility\u2019s solar-powered car that\u2019s designed not to grow too big to fit inside a city.\nThe company was founded by Chris Klok and Robert Hoevers, who met while working on the Lightyear solar car. Klok was chief vehicle engineer of that project, while Hoevers was previously involved with NIO\u2019s Formula E team. But they left Lightyear to help develop a small, solar-powered car that would offer affordable and clean mobility for dense cities. And while it\u2019s just got a few prototypes to show off, like the one here at CES 2024 in Las Vegas, it\u2019s expecting to begin production in 2025. Even better, many of its existing pre-order customers are based in the US, given the need for a car like this in those communities that exclusively rely on golf carts to get around.\nThe Solar City car has a 250Wp panel in its roof, which is designed to generate enough power for a few short trips each day. The company says that, in Las Vegas, you could expect to travel for around 13 miles purely from the energy collected from the panel. (You can plug it in to an outlet if you really need to.) With a kerb weight of 794 pounds, it\u2019s light and efficient enough to get you around short distances without much stress. Of course, the speed is limited \u2014 and you\u2019ll only get around 25mph out of the 4kW motor, but if you live in a big city and just need to get to work, or pick up some groceries, that\u2019s probably all you need.\nYou might expect the car to be poky, but the high roofline and low floor means it\u2019s surprisingly comfortable. The prototype here has some quirks \u2014 like acceleration and brake pedals that are a bit too close to the seat \u2014 which will be eliminated in the production version. There\u2019s even a rear load space big enough for a suitcase or a couple of decently-sized bags, and the prominent tires mean you could even tackle rough terrain in short doses. The fact it measures just 6.6 feet long means you can park it sideways and it\u2019ll take up the same amount of room as most cars, too.\nWe\u2019re still a year out from seeing the production model of this car, but there are plenty of reasons to be hopeful. The company expects the retail price to be $6,250 excluding sales tax, making it ideal as a city runaround or second (or third) car. That said, the figure does exclude the cost of the doors which, like AC, count as an optional extra.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12. Keep up with all the latest news from the show here."

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: Solar-powered headphones, city car and rooftop tent shine bright in Las Vegas\nSolar-powered devices and gadgets are making massive strides for a more sustainable future. Here is our pick of those turning heads at CES 2024.\nSustainability is, as ever, an increasingly dominant theme at all technology conferences, and the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) this year is no different.\nBut rather than just electric vehicles (EVs) on display, as well as hydrogen offerings, solar power also demonstrated its prowess in Las Vegas.\nHere is how solar energy stole the show.\nAmbient Photonics: Constant power to indoor and outdoor electronics\nThe US start-up Ambient Photonics showed off its new solar cell, which can provide constant power from indoor and ambient outdoor light, which the company says can deliver three times more power than existing technologies.\nThe tech could be used to replace billions of batteries in home gadgets, like TV remotes and wireless keyboards.\n\"Batteries are dead and indoor light is the future power source for billions of connected devices,\" the company said.\n\"Ambient photonics cells are built for real-world, low-light applications. They use revolutionary new molecules and manufacturing processes to harness indoor and outdoor ambient light and create an endless power source\".\nPowerfoyle: Solar-powered headphones\nThe Swedish clean technology start-up Exeger unveiled its new solar cell technology, which uses a light material to convert all types of light, even ambient light, into energy.\nThe material, called Powerfoyle, is the world's only fully customisable solar cell and it can be used in almost everything.\nExeger partnered with Adidas and Philips to deliver solar-powered headphones, which use the solar material on the headband and you never need to charge.\nThe company even made a stylish bag made of Powerfoyle, which can charge devices when put inside. The bag is not available for purchase but shows the potential of what the technology can do.\nThe Swedish company also showed off a powerful ear protector in a pair of headphones in its partnership with 3M.\nIt works using solar cells on the headband and is useful for those working in noisy environments, such as oil rigs and construction sites. It costs around \u20ac700, the company said.\n\"The perception of available energy is changing, how by light. It is everywhere and it is around us and we\u2019re dependent on that,\" Exeger founder Giovanni Fili told Euronews Next.\n\"And now we\u2019re going to use it to power our devices too. So this is a big year for Exeger\".\nThe Squad: Solar-powered city car\nWhile no one has cracked designing a car powered entirely by solar, one company from the Netherlands is offering a promising alternative.\nThe Squad, a solar city car by Squad Mobility, costs only around \u20ac8,500 and is a very compact car to drive in cities.\nIt can drive around 30 km a day in a sunny city like Las Vegas without needing a charge but also uses electric energy.\nThis is particularly useful if you live in cities with fewer hours of sunlight; in these places, the car can drive about 22 km without needing to be charged.\n\"In Holland, the winter is pretty bad for solar energy, so in winter you, you have to charge now and then, and in the summer you probably don't have to,\" Robert Hoevers, CEO and co-founder of Squad Mobility told Euronews Next.\nThe compact car weighs 350 kg and can reach speeds of 40 km/h.\n\"We get a lot of requests from food delivery companies servicing repair companies and medical companies that are looking for inner city mobility solutions for easy parking and easy charging,\" said Hoevers.\nJackery: The solar rooftop tent\nCalifornian solar company Jackery unveiled its Solar Generator Rooftop Tent and, as the name suggests, it looks like it could be used on another planet.\nIt is an automatic sunflower-shaped solar tracker with 600 W retractable solar wings that fits onto your car.\nThe idea is that if you spend time off the road, you can harness the power of the Sun to power up your coffee-making devices, air fryers, microwave ovens, and so on.\nYou can also turn it into a tent after you fold away the solar panels.\nYou can get up to 1,000 W of solar power per day, according to Jackery.\n\"It's more to help with the off-road lifestyle. Companies don't have the technology to create a fully solar-powered car yet. But right now, this is for an off-grid lifestyle,\" Kevin Chen, content manager at Jackery told Euronews Next.\nThe product is a concept for the moment, but Jackery says it could go into production at the end of this year.\nYou might also like\nAn iPhone survived a 4,500-metre fall from a plane intact.

We even found a car infotainment system that\u2019s worth your attention.\nKeep reading to find our picks for the best of CES 2024:\nAsus Zenbook Duo 2024\nThe Asus Zenbook Duo (UX8406) expands on the computer company\u2019s dual-screen laptop design with two 14-inch OLED touchscreen displays each with up to 3K resolutions.It comes with a detachable Bluetooth-enabled magnetic keyboard, while it\u2019s powered with an Intel Core Ultra 9 processor, up to 32GB of RAM and 1TB of on-board storage. Think of it as a dual screen tablet that runs Windows 11 and a full-sized keyboard.Asus has yet to announce pricing and availability, but it\u2019s expected to start around $1,400 with release sometime early 2024.\nLG Signature T OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV has to be seen to be believed. It\u2019s actually see through and a marvel to view. Darker colors and black level contrast can appear to be transparent like a window, while the brighter colors on the screen can display artwork that looks like it\u2019s almost floating, like an aquariums or fireplace.

It\u2019s powered with the Intel Core Ultra 7 processor 155Hz for buttery smoothness when playing PC games on its 7-inch Full HD 120Hz display. The name of the game is cooling, however, with MSI\u2019s \u201cCooler Boost HyperFlow\u201d technology and design to keep the handheld running smoothly without overheating on-the-go.We had a chance to try out the product and found it to be surprisingly lightweight and polished, while its action buttons and triggers seemed to be clicky and premium. It felt good in the hand and natural to play games.MSI is expected to begin selling the MSI Claw A1M sometime in early 2024 with pricing starting at $699.\nHyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller\nSpeaking of gaming on-the-go, the HyperX Clutch Tanto Mini Wired Controller is a cute travel-size Xbox controller that\u2019s lightweight and pocketable. But don\u2019t let its size fool you, it manages to pack in all of the action buttons, triggers, analog sticks and D-pad you\u2019d find on a full-sized Xbox controllers, but just compact. It\u2019s compatible with Xbox Series X/S consoles, PC, Steam Deck, and Android devices, while the controller even has a mobile mode switch for Android use and a 3.5mm headphone jack for a wired headsets.Based on our testing, the mini-controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller with a surprising amount of heft typically not felt with smaller controllers. The action buttons, triggers and analog sticks felt clicky with a deep travel and smoothness. It didn\u2019t feel cheap or flimsy, while it\u2019s definitely the type of controller you\u2019d throw in your backpack to play games at a friend\u2019s house, or at the office.HyperX, which is owned by HP, is expecting availability in spring 2024 with a price tag of $39.99.\nXreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses\nWith the anticipated release of the Apple Vision Pro, mixed reality (augmented and virtual reality) headsets are positioned to be big in 2024. However, the Xreal is offering a wallet-friendly alternative to Apple\u2019s $3,499-headset. At $699, the Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is made with dual Sony micro OLED displays with a resolution of 1080p per eye and a refresh rate of up to 120Hz.It features 6 DoF (six degrees of freedom) Tracking, as well as hand and head tracking, so AR images and objects will stay in place and interactable, even if you\u2019re wandering around a room. And since the glasses are lightweight, compared to the bulky Apple Vision Pro, you\u2019re not confined to one place to experience mixed reality. You can actually move in a space. Meanwhile, it needs a powerful and modern smartphone, like the Samsung Galaxy S23, Google Pixel 8 Pro or Apple iPhone 15, to work.The Xreal Air 2 Ultra AR Glasses is available for pre-order with delivery at the end of March.\nAcer Predator Z57\nThe new Acer Predator Z57 gaming monitor is great for an immersive gaming experience, thanks to its gigantic curved 57-inch mini-LED display with local dimming for deeper and darker black levels. It has a 1000R curvature, 7680 x 2160 4K resolution with up to 120Hz for smooth motion and action when gaming, while it has a peak brightness of 1,000 nits. The monitor has dual 10-watt speakers for audio, as well as AMD\u2019s FreeSync Premium to reduce screen tearing or distortion. It\u2019s ideal for PC consoles, Xbox Series X or PlayStation 5.Acer will have it ready for retail sometime during the first half of 2024 with pricing starting at $2,499.99.\nRoboRock S8 MaxV Ultra\nThe new Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is a hybrid cleaner that vacuums up dirt, dust and grime from carpets, rugs, and hardwood floors with powerful 10,000Pa of suction pressure, while it also mops tiles in kitchens and bathrooms with dual sonic vibration scrubbers.The smart home robovac has a versatile charging dock that\u2019s self-emptying with up to a seven-week capacity of debris storage, self-filling water tank for mopping, and self-cleaning reservoir for maintenance on itself. The Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra Robot Vacuum is perfect for larger rooms and homes.Roborock has it priced starting at $1,800 with an expected release date sometime in spring 2024.\nXgimi Horizon Max Projector\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is an IMAX Enhanced-certified projector, which means it fits the criteria for the resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio from IMAX at home. This type of certification is usually for 4K TVs, but Xgimi has the first long-throw projector that\u2019s IMAX Enhanced. In addition, some movies on Disney+ are IMAX Enhanced-certified \u2014 like \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy,\u201d \u201cAvengers: Endgame,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther,\u201d \u201cIron Man\u201d and others \u2014 so this seems like the perfect pairing.Meanwhile, Xgimi Horizon Max \u2014\u00a0which uses a Dual Light 2.0 laser system to project images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet high \u2014\u00a0has a motorized 360-degree gimbal system that can scan your living room or bedroom (or wherever you decide to place this projector) to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. It has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode, so you can have different settings for different walls in your home. So you can use one wall to watch movies and a different wall to play video games.The Xgimi Horizon Max is expected to be release by the end of 2024 with an estimated price tag of $3,000.\nRazer Blade 16\nPowered with the 14th Gen (Raptor Lake) Core i9-14900HX processor and GeForce RTX 4090 GPU, the new Razer Blade 16 is a powerhouse that will make short work out of just about any Triple-A PC game.It has a 16-inch OLED display with a 2560 x 1600 QHD+ resolution and a refresh rate of up to 240Hz for silky smooth motion and seamless action. The PC is touted as a gaming machine, as well as a creative studio since it has so much raw power at 175 watts.Razer Blade 16 will be available for pre-order at the end of Jan. with a release date sometime in Feb. It starts at $2,999.99.\nSamsung Music Frame\nWith the success of the Samsung Frame 4K TVs, the South Korean-tech company is expanding its \u201cFrame\u201d line to home audio with the Samsung Music Frame \u2014\u00a0which is designed to seamlessly blend in with your home decor with framed art or photography.It\u2019s a wireless speaker that\u2019s built with a woofer inside for deep and rich sound, along with Samsung\u2019s audio processing and \u201cQ-Symphony\u201d technology for robust audio. In fact, you can even pair them to a 2024 Samsung Frame 4K TV (coming soon) for a surround sound experience.Currently, Samsung didn\u2019t provide pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely that the Samsung Music Frame will come out sometime in 2024.\nPawport Smart Pet Door\nIf you have a pet, then it\u2019s very likely that you also have a pet door, so your furry companion can freely come in and out of your home. However, a pet door isn\u2019t usually secure, so tech company Pawport solved that problem with a smart pet door that\u2019s designed to slide over your existing door. Now you have access to open and close your door from your smartphone via Apple iPhone or Android mobile app.It even comes with a Bluetooth tracker collar that helps you keep track of when your pet walks through the door. In fact, when the smart door senses the tracker, it opens the door, so your pet can go outside with ease. Based on our limited time with the Pawport Smart Pet Door, we think pet owners are going to get a lot of use out of it, as well as peace of mind that their homes are safe and secure.The Pawport Smart Pet Door is available for pre-order with a release date in May 2024. If you sign up for pre-order, you can save up to $150 off the smart home device.\nTP-Link Archer BE900\nFor faster speeds and reduced latency, the TP-Link Archer BE900 is a beast. It\u2019s a quad-band Wi-Fi 7 router that works on three frequency bands (2.4Ghz, 5Ghz and 6Ghz) for faster speeds up to 46Gbps.It can stabilize more devices on one router, so everything on the network runs smoothly with virtually no lag. This is ideal for games, smart home device users, 4K and 8K streaming and people who work from home. TP-Link has yet to announce pricing and availability for the TP-Link Archer BE900.\nLand Moto District\nThe Land Moto District has a sleek and sexy eMoto that\u2019s designed with style, power and speed in mind. It has a waterproof and backlit LCD display and a range between 40 to 120 miles, while the bike\u2019s battery is completely swappable \u2014\u00a0which means you can charge one, while another one is in use. The electric motorcycle has a complete weight of up to 230 pounds, depending on which model and which battery size you pick. The Land Moto District is out now and in two styles: The Street for city use and The Scrambler for off-roading \u2014\u00a0both models start at $6,995.\nMercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024\nWhile the Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 is an impressive piece of machinery with elegance and power, it\u2019s new infotainment sound system is a feather in its all-electric cap. Powered by MBUX Sound Drive \u2014\u00a0which was brought to life in-part by musician and entrepreneur will.i.am \u2014 and the luxury vehicle features an \u201cinteractive musical experience\u201d that give the driver the ability to \u201cremix\u201d songs based on the car\u2019s movement and acceleration.After a brief test drive around the streets of Las Vegas, we can say MBUX Sound Drive is something that really has to be experienced to get how seamless and smart the technology really is. The car uses software and sensors to manipulate music in real-time.So if you\u2019re at a stop light, the musical elements like vocals will turn down softer in the background, and when you accelerate, it picks back up and opens up as you drive down the street for a new and immersive audio experience. It really did feel like being a conductor of an orchestra, or a DJ at a nightclub, as a way to remix the soundtrack or score of your commute.The Mercedes-AMG EQE SUV 2024 \u2014\u00a0which starts at $109,300 \u2014\u00a0is available now from Mercedes-Benz dealers, but MBUX Sound Drive will be ready for primetime this summer 2024 via over-the-air update.\nMost Popular\nCoachella 2024 Lineup Announced: Lana Del Rey, Tyler, the Creator, Doja Cat and No Doubt to Headline\n'All My Children' Actor Alec Musser's Cause of Death Revealed\nMatthew Perry Honored at Emmys as Emotional Cover of \u2018Friends\u2019 Theme Song Plays During In Memoriam Tribute\n\u2018Rust\u2019 Armorer Was Offered Leniency If She Explained Source of Live Bullet\nJodie Foster Called Out Hollywood in 1991 for Not Being \u2018Kind to Women\u2019 Directors: I \u2018Never Thought\u2019 a Film Like \u2018Barbie\u2019 Was \u2018Going to Happen\u2026\n\u2018White Lotus\u2019 Season 3 Casts Walton Goggins, Patrick Schwarzenegger, Aimee Lou Wood, Sarah Catherine Hook, Sam Nivola\nOscars: Nomination Voting Opens for AMPAS Members Until Jan. 16\nNoah Hawley Breaks Down 'Fargo' Season 5 Finale and Which Season Almost Had Its Own Spinoff\nSean 'Diddy' Combs and Diageo Resolve Legal Dispute\nEmmys Draw Record-Low Ratings With 4.3 Million Viewers\nMust Read\nEmmy Awards 2023: \u2018Succession\u2019 and \u2018The Bear\u2019 Tie With 6 Wins, \u2018Beef\u2019 Follows With 5 (Winners List)\nSeth Meyers Says Jo Koy \u2018Did a Great Job\u2019 as Golden Globes Host and the \u2018Deck Was Stacked Against Him\u2019\nAli Wong Thanks Her Late Father While Accepting Emmy for \u2018Beef\u2019: He \u2018Loved Me Unconditionally and Taught Me the Value of Failure\u2026\nElton John Is Now an EGOT Winner, Shares Heartfelt Reaction: \u2018I Am Incredibly Humbled\u2019 and \u2018Incredibly Grateful\u2019\nKieran Culkin Tells Wife 'I Want More' Kids in Emotional Emmys Victory Speech\nSign Up for Variety Newsletters\nVariety Confidential\nA Variety and iHeartRadio Podcast\nMore From Our Brands\nABC Cancels GOP Debate After Haley\u00a0Demands Trump Participate: \u2018Nowhere Left to Hide\u2019\nThis Churchill-Inspired Trip Includes Stops at Historic WWII Sites and Famous English Landmarks\nLegends Names Tom Funk President of Hospitality to Replace\u00a0Smith\nThe Best Exercise Bikes That Don\u2019t Require a Subscription\nFound Season 1 Finale Recap: Gabi\u2019s Sir Secret Finally Catches Up to Her\nThe Business of Entertainment\nAlerts and Newsletters\nFollow Us"

And over the past couple months, I\u2019ve been combing through hundreds of advance announcements and embargoed news releases.\nCES, like just about everything else in tech these days, will be AI heavy. Some of those AI applications will be useful, but I\u2019m guessing some of them will be just plain dumb\u2014I\u2019ll be telling you more about AI at CES later this week. There will be some innovations that are at the \u201ctechnology looking for a product\u201d stage. In this category, my things-to-look-at list includes new variations of spatial audio, more efficient solar cells and other energy harvesters, a neural network based on insect brains, and a silicon micromotor.\nThese enabling technologies, for me, are the big game of CES. But CES also features a host of cute and colorful creatures\u2014those tech gadgets you never knew you needed. Here in no particular order, are seven of the (hopefully) clever products I\u2019ll be tracking down. I\u2019ll update with pricing when those numbers become available.\nIs this finally the \u201cTricorder\u201d we\u2019ve been waiting for?\nThe BeamO is a compact health monitor for at-home checkups.Withings\nA real-world version of the Star Trek Tricorder has long been a grail for the consumer electronics industry. A decade ago, Qualcomm offered a multimillion-dollar prize for any team that could create such a mobile diagnostic device, and in 2017 it crowned the winners. But that development didn\u2019t quickly lead to a useful, multifunction health monitor arriving on pharmacy shelves.\nPerhaps, however, that gadget is about to hit the market. Smart scale\u2013maker Withings isn\u2019t calling its new product a tricorder; instead, it calls its BeamO device a \u201cmultiscope\u201d that is designed to monitor key vital signs\u2014acting as a thermometer, oximeter, stethoscope, and electrocardiograph machine. The company says the package is smaller than a smartphone and intended for informal at-home checkups and telehealth visits. Withings says that its BeamO can perform blood oxygenation and heart-rate readings at the same time that it conducts a medical-grade electrocardiogram (ECG), and then can be raised to take a temperature reading via an infrared scan of the temporal artery. To gather heart and lung sounds, the BeamO needs to touch the chest or back, where a piezoelectric disk in the device picks up sound waves; the sounds can be streamed to a remote physician. (Last year, the company introduced urinalysis in a toilet seat. That function is decidedly not included in this handheld device.)\nMirror, mirror, do I look stressed or depressed?\nGaze into the BMind smart mirror to gauge your mental state.Baracoda\nI\u2019m not sure I want my mirror telling me I need to calm down. But maybe that\u2019s just me, so I\u2019m trying to keep an open mind about Baracoda\u2018s BMind smart mirror. The BMind, the company indicates, will not only recognize when a user\u2019s mental state is less than par, but will suggest exercises and activities to improve it, including light therapy, guided meditation, and self-affirmations. Baracoda reports that the mirror uses the company\u2019s AI-based CareOS operating system to interpret expressions, gestures, and spoken words, adapting to the user\u2019s mood in real time.\nOr, magic mirror, am I getting sick?\nOr let the Anura MagicMirror check your vital signs.NuraLogix\nI debated whether to include another mirror\u2014and another health-monitoring device\u2014on this list. But the pandemic made many of us more concerned about variations in our own health, so it may be the right time for NuraLogix\u2019s Anura MagicMirror. The MagicMirror captures blood-flow patterns and analyzes them to determine heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, cardiac workload, mental stress, diabetes risk, fatty liver disease risk, and other vital signs and disease potentialities. (Last year, the company introduced some of these capabilities in a smartphone app.) It also assesses facial skin age\u2014after a couple of days of moisture-sucking Vegas air, late nights, and fluorescent lights I can\u2019t imagine that that assessment will go well. But I will check it out.\nLook Ma, no plug! This EV runs on solar\nGet around town in Squad Mobility\u2019s plugless Solar Buggy.Squad Mobility\nWhen I\u2019ve been on vacation in recent years, I\u2019ve noticed more people getting around beach towns in electric golf carts. Squad Mobility, based in the Netherlands, is taking the concept a step further: Its plugless EV charges directly from solar panels on the vehicle\u2019s roof. That makes sense, given that these types of vehicles are mostly used in good weather. At CES, Squad plans to demonstrate its Solar Buggy, a compact low-speed car that can carry two passengers (along with two surf boards) and is expected to retail for US $6,250.\nThe glove fits\u2014and fights the tremors of Parkinson\u2019s\nThe\nGyroGlove dampens tremors in the wearer\u2019s hand.GyroGear\nI\u2019ve had Parkinson\u2019s on my mind lately, since a friend was recently diagnosed and is already finding that hand tremors make it harder for her to perform simple tasks. So I\u2019m very excited to try on the GyroGlove from GyroGear. The concept seems straightforward, and it may be one of the few wearables at CES that doesn\u2019t have an AI angle. The doctor who developed the device reports that it took eight years to make it work. The glove incorporates a battery-operated gyroscope that resists hand movements, dampening tremors but allowing intentional movements to push through.\nDo we really need a new way to cook?\nSevvy\u2019s Smart Cooker uses pulsed electric fields to cook food more efficiently.Sevvy\nWe\u2019ve got microwaves, toaster ovens, steam ovens, sous vide, and air fryers, along with traditional gas and electric stoves\u2014so do we really need another cooking technology? It\u2019ll take a lot to convince me I need another countertop appliance, but I am curious about Sevvy\u2019s attempt to use pulsed electric fields (PEF) for cooking and baking. To date, the technology has been used in the commercial food industry, mainly for pasteurization of liquid and semisolid foods. But as far as I can tell, this Netherlands-based startup\u2019s Smart Cooker represents the first attempt to use PEF in a consumer appliance.\nSevvy says its patented approach uses 90 percent less energy than traditional ovens do and retains more nutrients. The company promises a CES demo of baking blueberry muffins in 3 minutes.\nBeware of cats bearing \u201cgifts\u201d\nFlappie\u2019s intelligent cat door filters out kitty\u2019s hunting trophies.Flappie\nAdmittedly, this gadget will be of interest to only a small subset of consumers, but for those affected, it addresses a real problem. And isn\u2019t finding solutions to real problems what engineering is all about?\nThe problem: Some cats like to bring their owners \u201cgifts\u201d\u2014gifts of prey, that is, from their hunting expeditions. The cats will carry the critters into the house, leaving owners to either dispose of the remains or chase a creature that had only been stunned. I do know people who have regular adventures involving the mice and lizards gifted by their cats.\nThe product, Flappie, is a cat door that recognizes a cat by its RFID chip and opens only when the cat is not carrying a \u201cgift.\u201d If it spots such a gift, it sends a photo to the owner\u2019s phone, just in case the owner wants to override the device\u2019s decision and let that lizard in. Flappie began as a student engineering project at ETH Zurich, and is expected to be available in the second quarter of 2024, at a presale price of $199 and a list price of $399.\nTekla S.

Instead, drivers simply need some daylight.\nSQUAD packs a battery that can travel up to 62 miles on a full charge. It\u2019s also equipped with a solar panel on the roof that can charge the battery while the car is rolling down the road.\nAccording to the company, drivers will be able to travel up to 13.6 miles further on a typical sunny day in the Netherlands. In brighter locales \u2014 such as Las Vegas \u2014 that additional range increases to nearly 20 miles.\nWhile the solar panel sets SQUAD apart from other electric vehicles, drivers have the option of plugging it in for a charge, so there shouldn\u2019t be any worries about running out of juice during a string of cloudy days.\nSQUAD is available for preorder and is priced starting at $6,250. It is expected to hit the market in 2024.\nSquad Mobility was founded in 2019 by Robert Hoevers and Chris Klok. Both are former Lightyear employees with a long track record in the motorcycle and automotive industries.\nThey said while individual drivers can certainly enjoy the vehicle, it is especially tailored toward shared mobility \u2014 meaning it\u2019s built for heavy use day in and day out. The vehicle is also decked out with safety features including a strong roll cage, three-point seat belts and a full crash structure at the front and rear.\n\u201cWe are seeing a tremendous interest from the USA, specifically for markets such as sharing platforms, gated communities, campuses, seaside resorts, tourism, company terrains, hotels and resorts, amusement parks and inner-city services,\u201d Hoevers said.\nPeter Schorsch is the President of Extensive Enterprises Media and is the publisher of FloridaPolitics.com, INFLUENCE Magazine, and Sunburn, the morning read of what\u2019s hot in Florida politics.\nPrevious to his publishing efforts, Peter was a political consultant to dozens of congressional and state campaigns, as well as several of the state\u2019s largest governmental affairs and public relations firms.\nPeter lives in St. Petersburg with his wife, Michelle, and their daughter, Ella.\nFollow Peter on Twitter @PeterSchorschFL.\nFlorida Politics is a statewide, new media platform covering campaigns, elections, government, policy, and lobbying in Florida.

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: AI, electric vehicles and sustainability take center stage\nAfter another whirlwind week of tech innovation, these are the top trends sure to dominate the year ahead.\n\u201cI think the biggest challenge with CES is come out of it feeling focused,\u201d said Andy Hart, CEO of SBD Automotive.\nGiven that a crowd of over 130,000 jostled their way through 4,000 exhibitors at last week\u2019s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, this feels both understandable, as well as an understatement.\nHart was speaking to HERE about the cutting-edge technology we can expect to make an impact in 2024. And if, like most of the world, you are transfixed by artificial intelligence (AI), there was no shortage of examples of how AI will impact our daily lives, especially when it comes to getting from A to B.\nRead more \u2014 Mercedes-Benz VP Automated Driving: Cars are more complex than airplanes\nAI in high gear\nBy now, asking Alexa to play you a song, or requesting today\u2019s weather from Siri feels completely natural \u2014 although far from a proper conversation. But thanks to Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, having a conflab with your car will soon be commonplace.\nBoth companies have integrated ChatGPT into their voice assistants with vehicle-specific information, which means that not only will you be able to ask if it is likely to rain while you\u2019re on the road, but also how in the world you open up the trunk.\n\u201cThere\u2019s been a lot of discussion of the use of AI and how it can transform the way businesses operate, as well as how it can improve the end-customer experience,\u201d said HERE CCO Jason Jameson. \u201cThe good news is that HERE has a pretty strong AI story. We use AI extensively with the way HERE UniMap ingests millions of map updates a day.\u201d\nRead more \u2014 CES 2024: HERE and Uber join forces to enhance precise mapping\nElectric ambitions\nFrom Honda\u2019s DeLorean-esque Zero Saloon to Kia\u2019s modular fleet of vans, there was no denying that all forms of electric transportation were the stars of this year\u2019s show (there was even a self-driving electric baby stroller).\nIt was also announced that the Lotus Emeya Hyper-GT, one of the most exciting new electric vehicles (EVs) hitting our streets in 2024, will follow in the Lotus Eletre\u2019s tire treads and come fully equipped with\u00a0HERE Navigation\u2019s EV Range Assistant package, including charge point POI search, multi-stop routing, range-on-map, and range-on-route \u2014 all capable of being updated over-the-air.\nHERE also plans to launch HERE EV Range Factors\u00a0 \u2014\u00a0aimed at reducing driver range anxiety with improved on-route battery range calculations \u2014 by the middle of this year.\nRead more: Will green hydrogen replace electric vehicle technology?\nSustainability first\nWith 2023 officially confirmed as the warmest on record, it was not a surprise that green tech was heavily talked about on the CES floor.\nHydrogen made a surprise clean energy comeback as Hyundai outlined plans to make the alternative fuel a significant part of its renewable development strategy.\nMeanwhile, trucking startup Nikola debuted its first US-built hydrogen truck and Bosch Mobility unveiled its new hydrogen combustion engine. The latter also announced their collaboration with\u00a0HERE and Daimler Truck AG on an advanced driver assistance system (ADAS) technology for commercial vehicles that automatically determines the most efficient driving style, helping to reduce driver stress, energy consumption, and CO2\u00a0emissions.\nAdditionally, HERE introduced HERE\u00a0Advanced Traffic Patterns,\u00a0a solution aimed at enhancing estimated time of arrival (ETA) accuracy, crucial for efficient and sustainable transportation operations.\nNotably, initial testing in Germany indicates up to a 15-minute improvement in ETA accuracy for heavy trucks over a 100km highway segment, highlighting its potential impact on long-distance hauls.\n\u201cThe challenge in some ways is leaving CES knowing not just what are the big trends but also what you don't need to focus on as you go back to your teams and how it all connects back to your own strategy, your own vision,\u201d said SBD Automotive\u2019s Hart.\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s tricky because it\u2019s so big. So many exhibitors, so many people. It\u2019s tough but that\u2019s a big reason why we come to the show.\u201d\nLouis Boroditsky\nManaging Editor, HERE360\nLouis Boroditsky\nManaging Editor, HERE360\nHERE UniMap\nCES 2024: AI, electric vehicles and sustainability take center stage\nHERE named #1 location platform by Counterpoint\nCES 2024: diving into the world's biggest tech show\nSign up for our newsletter\nWhy sign up:\nHERE"
