Four thousand five hundred companies from 149 countries and regions participated in the exhibition, of which 1,092 were from China. This is also the first time that Yibai Science&Technology (Shenzhen) Co., Ltd. participated in the show.\nYibai brought three TWS earphone products: SR20, NOTE20, and CARD20. These three products come from different philosophies.\nThe SR20 is inspired by the ripples caused by water droplets falling into the water.Using the principle of light reflection, the charging box and earphones will show different color gradient effects when viewed from different angles.The SR20 also adopts a shallow in-ear design, which makes it more comfortable to wear.\nNOTE20 is derived from the sticky notes that people see every day.\nIt adopts a hollowed-out ultra-thin design. The whole looks like a sticky note on the desktop, reminding users to enjoy music anytime.\nAt this exhibition, the most eye-catching product of Yibai is CARD20.\nThis wireless earphone is only 1.3cm thickness and weighs 36g.It adopts aluminum alloy CNC technology, and the diameter of the surface is only 0.075mm.Thin and textured.The CARD20 TWS headset also uses Qualcomm 3040 chip, supports aptX high-definition decoding, and the sound quality is balanced and comfortable.CARD20 provides users with a beautiful experience from visual, auditory, and tactile dimensions.\nRecent Posts\nYOBYBO Latest Earphone Creations Impress at Global Sources Exhibition\n2023 Spring Exhibition, Meet YOBYBO\n2022 Global Sources Hong Kong Electronics Fair \u4e28 YOBYBO\nProduct\nAll products\nSupport\nContact support\nLatest Products\nMetal Series\nHigh-end series\nLegal\nPrivacy\nCost-effective series\nCompany\nAbout Us\nStories\nHonor\nContact us\nCopyright\u00a9Yibai science&technology Co., Ltd \u00a0- All rights reserved."
