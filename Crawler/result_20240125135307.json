        "raw_content": "Big Chinese companies brighten 2024 CES\nChinese technology companies have made a prominent comeback at the 2024 Consumer Electronics Show (CES).\nAt the world's premier tech show in Las Vegas in the United States, they are showcasing their latest achievements in cutting-edge technologies. These range from artificial intelligence, next-generation semiconductor display, autonomous driving, robots to augmented reality.\nHighlighting that China is playing an increasingly vital role in bolstering technological innovation, experts said intelligent devices powered by generative AI and the internet of things are expected to become a key growth driver for global consumer electronics industry.\nAccording to the US Consumer Technology Association, which organizes the event, more than 4,000 enterprises from across the globe are participating in the CES, which opened on Tuesday and will conclude on Friday. Of these, 1,114 are from China and 1,201 are based in the US.\nAI-powered terminal devices are attracting attention this year amid a worldwide frenzy over the ChatGPT chatbot. Chinese consumer electronics maker TCL demonstrated over 120 pieces of intelligent hardware covering quantum dot mini-LED TVs, AI processing chips, smartphones, intelligent AR goggles and vehicle-mounted display products.\nThe company is accelerating efforts to expand presence in North America by boosting production capacity at its Mexican factory, given that building global competitiveness has always been important for TCL.\nHisense Group, a major Chinese home appliance manufacturer, unveiled its latest ultra light-emitting diode or ULED TV and laser display technology at the CES.\nDavid Gold, vice-president of Hisense International, said at a product launch event that display technology is widely applied in sports, education and medical fields, continuously pushing technological boundaries.\nLenovo Group Ltd, the world's largest personal computer maker, unveiled a full lineup of more than 40 new devices and solutions powered by AI at the CES. It said it believes this year will mark the advent of AI-based PCs.\nXpeng AeroHT, an affiliate of China's Xpeng Motors, showcased its pilotless flying car, an electric vertical takeoff and landing, or eVTOL, aircraft at the CES.\n\"Chinese tech companies are at the forefront of technological innovation globally, and actively promoting the application of AI in consumer electronics, intelligent devices and electric vehicles,\" said Hong Yong, a researcher at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation.\nThe latest technological breakthroughs made by Chinese companies in the fields of virtual reality and autonomous driving also reflect their strengths and innovative capabilities in crucial technologies, which will be conducive to industrial upgrades and boosting their own competitiveness on the global stage, Hong said.\nChinese augmented reality company Xreal showcased its latest AR-enabled innovative products by partnering with companies such as Qualcomm and BMW.\nCES attendees can join a Las Vegas tour hosted by BMW, where they will have the opportunity to experience Xreal's AR glasses along the way. They can witness how in-car information, including navigation cues, hazard warnings, entertainment content and charging station details seamlessly integrate into the real environment through Xreal Air 2 glasses.\nJin Peng, co-founder of Xreal, said, \"In the future world, whether it's in offices or entertainment, for mobile commuting or personal enjoyment, people will engage in work and experience life in new and creative ways.\"\nChinese tech companies have shown the potential to lead the industry not only in mature categories such as smartphones, but also in emerging fields such as artificial intelligence of things, AR and VR, said Pan Helin, co-director of the Digital Economy and Financial Innovation Research Center at Zhejiang University's International Business School.\nContact the writers at fanfeifei@chinadaily.com.cn\nCopyright 1995 -\n.

Puppyoo finds that people across the globe have increasingly higher demands for quality of life, and in recent years the consumer electronics market has exemplified the connection between forward-thinking development and market consumption.\nCES, the international Consumer Electronics Show hosted by CTA (Consumer Technology Association), promotes the integration of cutting-edge electronic technology and modern life. CES 2023 is the fifty-sixth exhibition, and Puppyoo, participating at the event for the first time, not only aims to display products on this grand stage but also to have direct contact with consumers and distributors to understand user needs and convey brand concepts in real-time.\nThe T22 Pro Rinse is the latest flagship product planned to launch at this exhibition. It is another realization of Puppyoo's 23 years of cultivating the research and development of its clean electronic products. The focus is on two aspects: The first is to extend the battery life in the max mode of the wireless vacuum cleaner. Revolutionizing the traditional integrated battery market, it adopts a replaceable dual-battery design, equipped with two 8*3200mAh polymer lithium-ion batteries as standard. Upgrading to two batteries, the T22 Pro Rinse can operate for 30 minutes in its strongest mode and up to 130 minutes in the eco mode, which can clean a whole house on a single charge. The second goal is to increase the suction power once again. As a specialized product in the field of household vacuuming, Puppyoo has to be strong. And according to research, the suction power of the T22 Pro Rinse is currently king among similar products on the market. Equipped with the latest generation of the Puppyoo M70 high-speed digital 3D motor, the machine reaches an impressive 770W.\nThe Puppyoo T12 series, the first choice in cleaning appliances for many overseas consumers, will also appear at CES. This series applies Puppyoo's key technologies and patents in the core field of vacuum cleaners, with robust suction power, full-scenario cleaning capabilities, and the whole array of the machine's features on display. According to customer feedback, it ranks firmly in the upper echelon of wireless handheld vacuum cleaners among all products at home and abroad. Among the T12 series, the T12 Pure and T12 Plus Rinse are very popular in the US market. The T12 Pure has a suction power of 170AW (Air Watts). The new cost-effective model has cemented itself as an affordable stand-out. The design of the magnetic dust bin makes it easier to clean with no mess. In addition, it can last for 60 minutes and has an intelligent self-adjusting system. The T12 Plus Rinse model is recognized for its unparalleled cleaning performance. It has a super suction of 185AW and can mop and vacuum at the same time. The digital display screen makes operation more intuitive, and the intelligent dust sensing system and 6-stage filtration design enable a safe and reliable cleaning process.\nIn addition, Puppyoo has a rich, vibrant product line. Puppyoo insists on improving the product ecosystem, focusing on user cleaning needs and introducing high-tech products such as sweeping robots, mite removers, and horizontal vacuum cleaners, all of which maintain high-performance ratings. At CES, these products will be exhibited together.\nContinuing into the future, Puppyoo dedicates itself to advancing the clean home appliance industry, adhering to the passion of users and the market, implementing more dynamic innovation and creative thinking, promoting product upgrades step-by-step, and achieving constant breakthroughs in brand growth.\nMedia ContactCompany: PuppyooEmail: suiyiran@puppyoo.comName: Erin SuiWebsite: www.puppyoo.comPhone: 010-64898117\nAdress: 4th floor, Building D, Shangba International Ad Park, Chaoyang District, Beijing\nTo view the source version of this press release, please visit https://www.newsfilecorp.com/release/150060\nSOURCE: Hmedium\nSign up for Alerts\nSign up to receive news releases by email for Hmedium or\nall companies belonging to the\nPublishing/Informational Services industry.\nSign Up\nRecent News\nCompany Profile\nArticles from Newsfile\nHashtags\nSimilar Stories\nPublishing/Informational Services\nTell Us Your Story\nAbout Us\nNewsfile is a customer-first newswire focused on the distribution of\npress releases and regulatory disclosures to audiences worldwide.\nLegal\nTerms of Use\nAnti-Spam Policy\nPrivacy Policy\nBill C-18\nCopyright 2024 Newsfile Corp.
