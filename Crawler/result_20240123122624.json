        "raw_content": "Watch LG's CES 2024 keynote highlights in 10 minutes\nHighlights include the company's first transparent OLED TV, an ultra-fast gaming display and an 4K projector.\nLG has been trickling out news about its latest product drops for weeks before CES 2024 officially kicked off, with highlights that include a wireless transparent OLED TV, an ultra portable 4K projector and a friendly looking two-legged robot that can roam your house and watch your pets.\nThe 77-inch signature OLED T has turned heads with its unique \"transparent\" look and wireless audio and video capabilities. It's also powered by a processor that improves overall display performance and visuals by 70 percent compared to the previous-gen chip, according to LG. Its OLED TV lineup is also getting bigger with the expected launch of the LG Signature OLED M4 and OLED G4 TVs. Both have Alpha 11 AI processor chips embedded in their design, which are meant to improve their image quality. The AI chips promise to reduce visual blurring and improve color contrasts.\nThere are some other big developments worth getting excited about in its display offerings \u2014 but in the gaming sphere. LG also announced a 27-inch QHD OLED gaming display with an extremely fast 480Hz refresh rate.\nWe're reporting live from CES 2024 in Las Vegas from January 6-12. Keep up with all the latest news from the show here."

From transparent TVs and home theater essentials, to cutting-edge beauty devices and smart home gadgets and beyond, we\u2019re sharing our top finds from the expo. Follow all of our CES coverage here.\nScreens are getting bigger, brighter, thinner and more accessible \u2014\u00a0and nowhere was that more apparent than at this year\u2019s CES. Our team spent a week at the expo checking out the best new TVs and projectors in person, and testing them first-hand during demos that allowed us to get an up-close look at the screen resolution, frame rates, vibrancy and more.\nRelated Stories\nPeak Chic: Balenciaga's $5,600 Snowboard Leads a Flurry of Luxury Skiwear and Accessories\nCara Delevingne, South Korean Model Xu Meen Make a Case for Digital Nomad Style in MCM's New Campaign\nAfter all the hands-on testing and comparing specifications, we chose the top TVs and projectors from CES 2024. Our selections were based on innovation, value, function and overall design, and include top brands such as Samsung, TCL, LG and more alongside companies rising in the ranks. See all of our top picks below.\nIf you purchase an independently reviewed product or service through a link on our website, The Hollywood Reporter may receive an affiliate commission.\nHisense CanvasTV\nSamsung\u2019s not the only tech company that makes an art-ready frame TV. Hisense introduced their own frame TV called the Hisense CanvasTV and much like the Samsung version, it\u2019s thin with customizable wood-finish bezels and designed to seamlessly fit in with your home decor. The TV can also display different pieces of artwork as well as your own personal photos. It can even hang from a wall with Hisense\u2019s zero-gap wall mount.During our time with the product, we found the Hisense CanvasTV to be slim and stylish. In fact, at the Hisense booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center, TVs were displayed on a wall with traditional frames and it was tough to distinguish which were pieces of artwork and which were the Hisense CanvasTVs until the rotating display image changed.Hisense has yet to announce pricing or availability, but it\u2019s likely to be less expensive than the Samsung Frame TV \u2014\u00a0which starts at $599.99 for the 32-inch model. The Hisense is expected to be released sometime in 2024.\nSamsung Neo QLED 8K TV\nSamsung\u2019s new Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) is a slim and premium TV that delivers a mini-LED backlit picture quality with the tech company\u2019s own QLED display that comes with a \u201cfloating\u201d stand and many sizes ranging from 65 inches to a massive 98 inches. Meanwhile, Samsung\u2019s \u201cAI Motion Enhancer Pro\u201d technology boosts fast-moving image quality, especially for action movies and live sports, with a variable refresh rate of up to a whopping 240Hz.This Samsung TV certainly has the cool factor with 8K picture quality (four times the sharpness of 4K) and gigantic sizes. And while true 8K content is only readily available to watch on YouTube and some live sporting events, it may be difficult to find 8K movies and TV shows, as a whole. However, the tech company provides built-in 8K upscaling with \u201cAI Upscaling Pro,\u201d which is a setting that essentially converts 4K content into 8K image quality.Although Samsung has yet to announce pricing and availability, the Samsung Neo QLED 8K TV (QN900D) will likely come out during spring 2024 with a price tag upwards of $8,000.\nLG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV\nThe LG OLED 77-inch Transparent TV is a new type of TV that can be viewed like a normal TV, but also has the ability to be see-through when displaying artwork, like an aquarium or fireplace, almost like a window. It uses a contrast filter to switch from normal view to transparent. However, one of its main draws is it nearly wireless setup. While you do have to plug in the TV unit, its components, like HDMI ports, go through LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box \u2014\u00a0which is a wireless receiver that can be placed away from the TV itself. So instead of having a transparent TV with unsightly cable and wires plugged into it, you can actually have a clean presentation.LG did not provide pricing, while it\u2019s likely to be available at the end of 2024.\nAwol Vision Vanish Laser TV\nThe Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is an impressive home entertainment system that comes with the Awol LTV-3500 short-throw projector, a massive 100- or 120-inch projection screen and a wide smart cabinet to house both. In fact, the screen is motorized and rolls away inside the cabinet with a push of a button. You can now have it on display when you\u2019re watching a movie or a sports event and roll it away when it\u2019s not in use.We had a chance to try out the product and found the picture quality sharp and detailed, while the motorized-rollable screen was smooth and elegant with an overall wow factor when seeing it in action.The Awol Vision Vanish Laser TV is available now and retails starting at $14,999.\nTCL QM7 4K TV\nIf you\u2019re a gamer and you\u2019re looking for a top-of-the-line TV for 4K gaming in 2024, then look no further than the TCL QM7 Series. It has multiple sizes ranging from 55 to 98 inches (QM751G) with QD Mini LED Ultra technology for deeper, darker and more nuanced black levels with more than 1,000 dimming zones and brighter, vivid and more accurate colors with up to 1,500 nits of peak brightness.In our brief testing period, we played Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III for the PlayStation 5 at the TCL booth during CES 2024 and we found action smooth with zero input lag (thanks to a variable refresh rate of up to 144Hz), while the TV displayed multiple setting for game mode and shadow enhancers for a more realistic gameplay. We also didn\u2019t noticed any screen tearing, or ghosting. It just felt seamless and natural to pick up and start playing.\nBest Products at CES 2024: Projectors\nXgimi Horizon Max\nThe Xgimi Horizon Max is a small long-throw home projector that\u2019s certified to display Imax-Enhanced movies. This means it has the criteria specified by Imax for premium format picture quality at home, such as resolution, color, contrast, brightness and DTS:X audio.Additionally, the projector can throw images up to 180 inches, or 15 feet, on a wall, while its motorized 360-degree gimbal system can scan your living room or bedroom to adjust and configure it for the best picture quality. In fact, it even has a \u201cfavorite\u201d mode to save different settings for different walls in your home \u2014\u00a0depending on if you\u2019re watching a movie or playing a video game. In our brief testing period, the Xgimi Horizon Max showed real promise for high-quality video projection in the home.Xgimi hasn\u2019t announced when the Horizon Max would be available, but it\u2019s expected to come out by the end of 2024 around $3,000 retail.\nYaber UST K300 Laser Projector\nIf you have limited space, then the Yaber K300 Laser Projector can work wonders. It\u2019s an ultra-short-throw projector that only needs up to 15 inches of space between itself and a wall to produce high-quality images with bright and vivid colors with deep black levels, thanks to triple laser technology that produces more accurate colors. However, what makes it really impressive is its small and lightweight design that\u2019s sleek and stylish for the home or office. It\u2019s expected to launch on Amazon this year.\nRead More About:\nTHR Newsletters\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\nMore from The Hollywood Reporter\nJenna Ortega\u2019s Emmy Red Carpet Look Generated $5.6 Million in Media Exposure for Dior at the Emmys\nHow to Watch NCAA Women\u2019s College Basketball on TV (and Where to Find a Livestream Online)\nA New \u2018Barbie\u2019 Book Will Reveal Margot Robbie\u2019s Never-Before-Seen Press Tour Looks, Rare Mattel Photos and More\nHow to Stream \u2018The Bachelor\u2019 Season 28 Online Without Cable\nOmega Fetes Andrew Garfield With Dinner During Paris\u00a0Men\u2019s Fashion Week\nOne of the Best 4K Projector TVs Is On Sale Ahead of Your Super Bowl Viewing Party\nMost Popular\nMeghan Markle & Prince Harry Are Reportedly 'Shocked' Over the Controversy Surrounding Daughter Lilibet's Name\nThe Egyptian Government Bulldozed an Iconic Cairo Art Center With \u2018Millions\u2019 in Art Inside\nKobe-Inspired Mamba Foundation Amasses Cash but Spends Little\nH-Town Shares Music Video For \"Strokey Doke\" Starring Drea Kelly\nYou may also like\nThe Best Medicine Balls, According to Fitness Trainers\nFord\u2019s New Mach-E Mustang Bronze Is Its Fastest Electric Model Yet\nGeorge Clinton Reflects On Walk Of Fame Star: \u201cThis Feels Good As\u00a0Sh*t\u201d\nSubscriber Support\nThe Hollywood Reporter\nLegal\nFollow Us\nNewsletter Sign Up\nHave a Tip?\nSend us a tip using our anonymous form.\nOur Sites\nNews\nExpand news menu\nFilm\nExpand film menu\nTV\nExpand tv menu\nAwards\nExpand awards menu\nLifestyle\nExpand lifestyle menu\nBusiness\nExpand business menu\nMore Essentials\nExpand more-essentials menu\nFollow Us\nAlerts & Newsletters\noptional screen reader"

        "raw_content": "CES 2024: LG's Massive OLED TV Ditches Wires and Incorporates (What Else?) AI\nLG's pre-CES announcements include a slew of new home entertainment products, including the wireless, 97-inch M4 OLED TV, ultra-slim G4 OLED TV, and a tiny, high-contrast portable projector.\nI\u2019ve been PCMag\u2019s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them. I\u2019ve reviewed more than a thousand different consumer electronics products including headphones, speakers, TVs, and every major game system and VR headset of the last decade. I\u2019m an ISF-certified TV calibrator and a THX-certified home theater professional, and I\u2019m here to help you understand 4K, HDR, Dolby Vision, Dolby Atmos, and even 8K (and to reassure you that you don\u2019t need to worry about 8K at all for at least a few more years).\nCES 2024 isn't until next week, but LG got a head start today by unveiling a slew of home entertainment displays before the show. The company just announced its newest flagship OLED TVs, joining the LED TVs and projector it revealed last week.\nThe LG Signature OLED M4 sits at the top of the heap, as an OLED TV that can wirelessly display video at up to 4K resolution and 144Hz streamed from its separate Zero Connect box. This concept was first showed off last year in the OLED M3, but the new version bumps up the maximum refresh rate from 120Hz to 144Hz, and is 150% brighter in peak highlights, LG says.\nThe M4 will also be available in a 65-inch model as well as the 77-, 83-, and 97-inch sizes we saw on the M3. This makes the M4 more accessible in size and presumably price. LG hasn't announced pricing for its newest TVs yet, but the 65-inch M4 will likely be much less expensive than the 77-inch M3, which retails for $4,999.\nFor OLEDs, LG also updated its high-end G line from G3 to G4. The G4 is a conventional TV compared with the wireless M4, and features a very slim design with a nearly flush wall-mounting option, and is updated with a 144Hz refresh rate and a brighter panel.\nBoth the G4 and M4 incorporates LG's new Alpha 11 image processor, which LG claims features 70% better graphical performance and 30% faster speed. LG's popular C3 OLED TV is also being updated to the C4, as well as the entry-level B3 to the B4, but these appear to be minor, iterative updates that use the same image processor as the previous models.\nLG showed off its newest projector as well. The CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that can display a 4K picture with, according to LG, a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. Its most interesting aspect is its size: at 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches (HWD) and 3.3 pounds, it's extremely small for a 4K projector, comparable in volume and slightly lighter than Samsung's 1080p FreeStyle projector.\nRecommended by Our Editors\nFor LED TVs, LG has announced updates to several of its QNED lines. Most notable is the the flagship QNED90, which has what the company called Million Gray Scale that can display 20-bit grayscale gradation. Like the name implies, this should mean the QNED90 can show many, many more shades of gray than most other LED TVs and likely all OLED TVs for which grayscale and brightness variation are typically more difficult. The QNED85 doesn't feature Million Gray Scale, but it stands as LG's biggest LED TV with a 98-inch model available.\nPricing and availability for these new displays haven't been announced yet, but we'll be on the floor at CES to check them out in person.\nSign up for What's New Now to get our top stories delivered to your inbox every morning.\nThis newsletter may contain advertising, deals, or affiliate links.

AI\nLG's pre-CES announcements include a slew of new home entertainment products, including the wireless, 97-inch M4 OLED TV, ultra-slim G4 OLED TV, and a tiny, high-contrast portable projector.\nCES 2024 isn't until next week, but LG got a head start today by unveiling a slew of home entertainment displays before the show. The company just announced its newest flagship OLED TVs, joining the LED TVs and projector it revealed last week.\nThe LG Signature OLED M4 sits at the top of the heap, as an OLED TV that can wirelessly display video at up to 4K resolution and 144Hz streamed from its separate Zero Connect box. This concept was first showed off last year in the OLED M3, but the new version bumps up the maximum refresh rate from 120Hz to 144Hz, and is 150% brighter in peak highlights, LG says.\nThe M4 will also be available in a 65-inch model as well as the 77-, 83-, and 97-inch sizes we saw on the M3. This makes the M4 more accessible in size and presumably price. LG hasn't announced pricing for its newest TVs yet, but the 65-inch M4 will likely be much less expensive than the 77-inch M3, which retails for $4,999.\nFor OLEDs, LG also updated its high-end G line from G3 to G4. The G4 is a conventional TV compared with the wireless M4, and features a very slim design with a nearly flush wall-mounting option, and is updated with a 144Hz refresh rate and a brighter panel.\nBoth the G4 and M4 incorporates LG's new Alpha 11 image processor, which LG claims features 70% better graphical performance and 30% faster speed. LG's popular C3 OLED TV is also being updated to the C4, as well as the entry-level B3 to the B4, but these appear to be minor, iterative updates that use the same image processor as the previous models.\nLG showed off its newest projector as well. The CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that can display a 4K picture with, according to LG, a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. Its most interesting aspect is its size: at 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches (HWD) and 3.3 pounds, it's extremely small for a 4K projector, comparable in volume and slightly lighter than Samsung's 1080p FreeStyle projector.\nFor LED TVs, LG has announced updates to several of its QNED lines. Most notable is the the flagship QNED90, which has what the company called Million Gray Scale that can display 20-bit grayscale gradation. Like the name implies, this should mean the QNED90 can show many, many more shades of gray than most other LED TVs and likely all OLED TVs for which grayscale and brightness variation are typically more difficult. The QNED85 doesn't feature Million Gray Scale, but it stands as LG's biggest LED TV with a 98-inch model available.\nPricing and availability for these new displays haven't been announced yet, but we'll be on the floor at CES to check them out in person.\nAbout Will Greenwald\nI\u2019ve been PCMag\u2019s home entertainment expert for over 10 years, covering both TVs and everything you might want to connect to them.

Purchases made through the links below may earn us and our publishing partners a commission.\nWe're mere days away from the start of CES 2024, but LG is wasting no time getting the word out about one of its most popular products: OLED TVs. In recent years, the company has faced stiff competition in this space from both Samsung and Sony, and those brands seem poised to put up another tough fight in 2024.\nAt the heart of LG\u2019s 2024 OLED announcements are new developments in the brand\u2019s AI-based picture processing endeavors. Its new lineup of processing chipsets is lead by the all-new a11 AI Processor, which LG claims offers \u201ca 70 percent improvement in graphic performance and a 30 percent faster processing speed.\u201d In layman\u2019s terms, LG is promising a sharper picture, with AI-based processes enhancing everything from color to clarity. Not all of LG\u2019s newest OLEDs will be getting the a11 chipset, but the company cited improvements to AI processing across all of its newest OLED TVs.\nSign up for our newsletter.\nEnter your email:\nThanks for signing up.\nThank You!\nMLA (Micro Lens Array) technology, a brightness-boosting hardware enhancement that LG introduced in certain panels last year, is also making its way into more models in the coming months, and the majority of LG\u2019s OLED TVs in 2024 will see an upgraded, 144Hz refresh rate spec to compete with brands like Samsung.\nHere's a breakdown of everything we know so far about each of LG's 2024 OLED TVs.\nLG M4\nThe crown jewel of the 2024 LG TV lineup is the M4, a futuristic TV that blends the unparalleled picture quality of an OLED display with a unique, wireless approach to hardware. Like its predecessor, the M3, the M4 houses all of its inputs and processors in a box that can be placed elsewhere in the room. New to the M Series this year is a 65-inch variant, which could entice those who were intrigued by the M3 last year, but ultimately balked at the exclusively large size options.\nThe LG M4 OLED offers a completely wireless connectivity experience, so gamers will have a ton of flexibility when it comes to where they want to place their consoles.\nWe were unable to get our hands on the M3 or LG\u2019s Zero Connect Box last year, but by all accounts, the technology proved successful. The wire-free approach to the TV\u2019s design offers unmatched flexibility for home theater enthusiasts, particularly those that wish to wall-mount their TV.\nBeing the tippy-top OLED TV in LG\u2019s catalog, the M4 is naturally sporting the best hardware and software features the company has to offer, in addition to its exciting wireless functionality. It features MLA technology for added brightness, a full suite of HDMI 2.1 inputs, and a refresh rate of up to 144Hz (a first for LG OLEDs).\nLG G4\nThe LG G3 was one of the best TVs we saw last year, thanks in part to the introduction of MLA technology, which allowed it to get substantially brighter than any previous LG OLED. The all-new G4 is equipped with MLA tech, too, so we expect an equally luminous picture in 2024\u2014at least for the 55-, 65-, 77-, and 83-inch models. The room-dominating 97-inch G4 does not offer MLA hardware.\nLike the M4, the G4 also offers HDMI 2.1 functionality across all four of its inputs and a refresh rate of up to 144Hz, which is sure to satisfy PC gamers looking to link up with an impressive TV.\nLG C4\nThe C4 is the latest version of LG\u2019s award-winning C Series. It\u2019s the successor to the LG C3, our current pick for the overall best TV you can buy.\nThe C Series earns its accolades in large part due to its price. While not cheap, TVs like the C4 can be had for much less than most brands\u2019 top-tier offerings. The C4 is no different; if you want the AI-based picture processing capabilities and the brightest possible picture, you\u2019ll have to spend up on the G4 or M4. Unlike those models, the C4 doesn\u2019t come with LG\u2019s newest processor, nor does it offer the brightness-boosting MLA display hardware that those upper-tier TVs are sporting.\nNevertheless, we expect the C4 to live up to the prestigious legacy of its namesake. In addition to many of the features we\u2019ve come to expect from the series (including four HDMI 2.1 inputs), the C4 also offers an upgraded 144Hz refresh rate.\nLG B4\nThose looking for the most affordable entry point into LG\u2019s newest OLED lineup will set their sights on the B4, which comes with a leaner set of hardware- and software-related features than the aforementioned higher-end models. Despite its modest presentation, the B4 is anything but stripped down; it seems closer to the C Series models of yesteryear, which is plenty good for most.\nWith CES less than a week away, major announcements from mainstream TV brands like Samsung, Sony, TCL, and Hisense are imminent.

By generating a remarkable 480 frames per second, the 27-inch 480Hz QHD gaming OLED panel provides the optimal gaming experience with its smooth and sharp visuals, even during fast screen transitions.\nThe 34- and 39-inch panels offer an ultra-wide (21:9) aspect ratio\u00a0for an immersive gaming experience, while the 31.5-inch panel supports a clear UHD (3840\u00d72160) resolution that makes it suitable not only for gaming but also for office work and content consumption.\nLG Display\u2019s gaming OLED panels include millions of self-emitting pixels without a separate backlight source to boast high refresh rates and resolutions, as well as a fast response time of 0.03ms. In addition, the company has incorporated \u2018META Technology\u2019 into its OLED gaming displays to further enhance the overall image quality while minimizing external light reflections during darker scenes.\nFurthermore, LG Display will present its full lineup of Transparent OLEDs, including the 30-, 55-, and 77-inch displays, to present new shopping experiences to retail spaces by creating unique applications through the use of mid-sized and ultra-large Transparent OLED panels.\nAs the world\u2019s only manufacturer of Transparent OLED, LG Display maximizes OLED\u2019s self-emissive nature to achieve a transparency rate high enough to seamlessly replace glass windows, portray accurate color expression, and provide design flexibility that boosts space utilization.\nTransparent OLEDs are also suitable for indoor use thanks to their lower heat generation compared to conventional LEDs, while their versatility allows for installation in almost all spaces and interiors such as windows, walls, and floors of various sizes.\nIn its West Hall booth, LG Display will showcase its ultra-large \u2018Pillar-to-Pillar (P2P)\u2019 display solution optimized for Software Defined Vehicles (SDV), which utilize the company\u2019s differentiated automotive display technologies such as P-OLED, ATO (Advanced Thin OLED), and LTPS (Low-Temperature Polysilicon) LCD.\nThe \u2018Ultra-large P2P P-OLED\u2019 seamlessly integrates a \u201812.3-inch P-OLED\u2019 dashboard display and \u201934-inch P-OLED\u2019 center screen to create a sleek, sophisticated design that covers the entire dashboard as a large singular display. Meanwhile, the \u201948-inch P2P LTPS LCD\u2019 boasts an expansive screen that allows drivers and passengers to see useful driving information while enjoying entertainment features.\nWith the emergence of large displays like P2P, LG Display is also introducing its \u2018Switchable Privacy Mode (SPM),\u2019 which effectively keeps the driver\u2019s focus on the road by controlling the passenger display\u2019s viewing angle.\nLG Display will also showcase solutions that maximize space efficiency within the limited confines of a vehicle while offering new in-car experiences, including the \u201817-inch Foldable OLED\u2019 designed for RSE (Rear Seat Entertainment) and the \u201818-inch Slidable OLED\u2019 that is hidden in the ceiling and can be extended downwards for use.\nIn addition, the company\u2019s differentiated \u2018Thin Actuator Sound Solution\u2019, which is just 30 percent of the weight and 10 percent of the thickness of a conventional car speaker, can be installed in various areas inside the vehicle, such as the display, ceiling, and floor, for a richer, more 3D immersive sound experience.\nMoreover, LG Display will present cutting-edge technologies engineered to make spaces more aesthetically pleasing, such as an \u2018Under Display\u2019 that conceals the cameras installed on the display by adjusting the overall transparency, and \u2018Decorative Film\u2019 that allows screens to resemble interior materials such as wood or carbon when inactive.\nBy unveiling display solutions that unlock new experiences for global consumers, LG Display plans to strengthen its business competitiveness even further and secure potential customers through its differentiated products and technologies.\nRelated Posts\nLG Display announces winners of this year\u2019s OLEDs Go! competition\nLG Display Unveils the World\u2019s First High-Resolution Stretchable Display\nLG Display Unveils High-Performance Gaming OLED Displays at CES 2023\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2021 LG DISPLAY CO., LTD.\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED.\nCOPYRIGHT \u00a9 2024 LG DISPLAY CO., LTD.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 proves Samsung and LG's best OLED TV tech isn\u2019t going down in price anytime soon\nMLA and QD-OLED screen panels remain a flagship luxury, at least for now\nCES 2024 has kicked off the home cinema year with a bang, with huge TVs including the flagship LG G4, Samsung S95D and Panasonic Z95A making their debut at the tech tradeshow in Las Vegas.\nAnd while our team reporting from the showroom floor found plenty to get excited about during their opening looks at the top-of-the-line new sets, one sad fact became increasingly apparent \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look like the top-of-the-line MLA or QD-OLED panels seen on last year\u2019s flagships is going down in price any time soon.\nFor readers unfamiliar with the ins and outs of OLED TV tech, Micro Lens Array (MLA) and QD-OLED are competing technologies with one shared aim \u2013 to radically boost the maximum brightness possible on OLED panels.\nQD-OLED is a technology built by Samsung that\u2019s been around for a couple of years. It powers the company\u2019s newly unveiled flagship, the Samsung S95D as well as Sony\u2019s 2023 hero TV, the Sony A95L. It combines traditional OLED panel tech with Samsung\u2019s Quantum Dots to help boost a TV's maximum brightness.\nMLA is a display made by LG Display that made its debut last year on the LG G3, Panasonic MZ2000 and Philips OLED 908. It boosts max brightness levels by placing a layer of microscopic lenses on top of a traditional OLED panel\u2019s pixels.\nHaving tested both technologies thoroughly we can confirm both work brilliantly. On every MLA set we tested we noticed a clear boost in max brightness levels, especially when comparing the MLA-sporting LG G3 to the older LG G2.\nOn the other side of the ring, the additional brightness and improved colour accuracy offered by the second generation QD-OLED panel used on the Sony A95L impressed our TV expert, Tom Parsons, enough for him to call it \u201cthe new benchmark\u201d for OLED TVs.\nThe only downside to both technologies is that they were limited to a very select, very expensive family of flagship TVs \u2013 which made them an expensive luxury even by our standards and was the main reason our best TV guide and 2023 Award winners were dominated by more affordable, traditional OLED sets like the Sony A80L.\nThe high price of the next-generation OLEDs is also why it was no surprise our forums, Reddit, and the internet in general were rife with speculation about whether LG and Samsung in particular would bring the technologies down in price in 2024. Specifically, whether MLA would feature on the LG C4 and QD-OLED on the Samsung S90D.\nAs a C2 owner, I can attest to having a glimmer of hope this would happen in 2024. After all, we\u2019ve seen this happen numerous times in the past with things like HDMI 2.1 connectivity, variable refresh rates and eARC support which first appeared on flagships before trickling their way down to more affordable sets a year later. The pattern\u2019s always been that the tech starts on a flagship before trickling down the line each year.\nAnd CES 2024 would have been the perfect time to do this, with Samsung, LG and Panasonic having always used the show to launch their respective TV offerings for the year.\nBut sadly, instead of that occurring, we\u2019ve seen very modest changes to this year\u2019s mid-tier OLEDs. The LG C4 has identical connectivity to the C3, with the only big changes being a slightly upgraded processor and 144Hz, rather than 120Hz max refresh rate. The panel remains a basic OLED Evo, without MLA.\nIt\u2019s a similar story with the S90D, where the most interesting change is the fact Samsung\u2019s now offering it in a smaller 48-inch option. While it\u2019s great to see more small OLED TVs on the market \u2013 in the UK not everyone can fit a 55-inch, let alone 65-inch TV into their lounge \u2013 it\u2019s hardly as exciting as seeing QD-OLED appear on a cheaper set.\nPanasonic\u2019s done the same with its current line, choosing to only add MLA to its flagship Z95A OLED set, leaving the Z93A without it.\nI'll admit that this is a first-world problem. But given how small the changes to last year\u2019s mid-tier OLED TVs were, especially when comparing the LG C3 and LG C2, I can\u2019t help but feel a little disheartened that OLED TV makers have forgotten how important the mid and even entry-level market is \u2013 especially during a cost of living crisis where it\u2019s difficult for most people to justify the \u00a31000 / $1000-plus you\u2019d need to get a mid-tier TV, let alone the \u00a32000 / $2000-plus you need for a flagship.\nHopefully, this won\u2019t remain the case for the whole year, and Sony and Philips are yet to unveil their 2024 OLED offerings. But either way, I can\u2019t help but feel LG and Samsung missed a trick at CES this year by not doing more in the mid-tier market.\nMORE:\nThese are the best small TVs we\u2019ve tested\nOur picks of the best 55-inch TVs money can buy\nWe detail the best gaming TVs we\u2019ve reviewed\nGet the What Hi-Fi?

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "XDA\nOLED laptops, monitors, and a tunnel made of screens: Checking out LG's CES 2024 showcase\nLG always makes a splash at CES, and for 2024, it had some pretty cool stuff to show off. Here's everything we saw.\nKey Takeaways\nLG is one of the biggest companies in the world, and it always goes all out for events like CES, Not just in terms of announcements but also in terms of flair when it comes to its booth. At CES 2024, there was plenty to admire on both of these fronts from LG, and I got to check out all of it.\nThe LG Gram Pro is the most premium LG laptop yet\nThin, light, and beautiful\nI'll start with the real products from LG's showcase, specifically, the LG Gram lineup. LG refreshed most of its existing models from last year, including all the numbered versions and the LG Gram SuperSlim, though none of them features much new aside from Intel Core Ultra processors.\nHowever, the LG Gram Style didn't get a refresh; instead, we have the Gram Pro. This is clearly meant to be LG's most premium product, and it shows. The LG Gram Pro lineup includes 16-inch and 17-inch clamshell models, as well as a 16-inch convertible, and they all look fantastic. They keep the iconic lightness of the Gram series, and they're as thin as the Gram SuperSlim, but they're much more premium. They now come with up to a 2.8K OLED panel with a variable refresh rate of up to 120Hz, and while they're still using magnesium in the build, this is the most premium I've ever seen a Gram laptop feel. It feels solid and smooth to the touch without the sort of flimsiness that can be found on some of LG's other laptops.\nRegarding the 2-in-1 model, LG even told me that the team specifically tried to reduce the gap between the display and the base when used in tablet mode to prevent flexing on the display and make it feel more solid. From what I could see, that all paid off. These laptops feel great, and after LG lost a bit of its competitive edge with so many laptops being thin and light, these feel like they put the Gram series right up against other premium laptops on the market. I'm definitely looking forward to checking these out in a full review in the future.\nA 4K 240Hz dual-mode OLED monitor\nThe first of its kind\nCES 2024 has been a prime time for OLED gaming monitors, with models coming left and right from almost every company. You've probably also seen a lot of very similar models: a 32-inch panel with 4K resolution and a 240Hz refresh rate. LG is joining the fray with one of these, too, but with a twist \u2014 this one is a dual-mode panel, and in fact, it's the only monitor out of all the CES announcements to do so.\nThe LG UltraGear 32 uses a beautiful OLED panel with super fast response times, and it comes with the option to either use it in 4K at 240Hz or 1080p at 480Hz. I can't really tell you that I see the difference between 240Hz and 480Hz, but this screen looks absolutely beautiful, and if you do play games where lightning-fast reflexes are important, then this seems like a fantastic option. As you can probably tell from the images above, there was a lot of fast movement on screen, so I couldn't get a very good picture, but the monitor looks great in real life.\nOne thing I can tell though is that the sound experience is very different from a typical monitor. It uses what LG is calling Pixel Sound, which means that instead of having speakers fire down, the audio comes directly from behind the screen. From my quick demo, it did feel a bit more immersive since the sound comes from the same place as the image. It was great.\nThere were other gaming monitors from LG at the show, including some new panels with an 800R curvature, which is supposed to be more immersive. I don't play a lot of video games on my PC, but I don't really like screens with such an extreme curve. Still, they were OLED, so the viewing angles were basically perfect, and the curvature won't make the edges look weird. The new models also have a redesigned flat stand that lets you make better use of your desk space than the traditional V-shaped models. I'm very much in favor of this design change.\nLG myView monitors\nGiving Samsung's smart monitors some competition\nContinuing on the topic of monitors, LG also had the brand-new myView lineup at the show. These are basically competitors to Samsung's Smart Monitors, and they're pretty much the same concept: they're monitors that run webOS, so you can use media apps on them without a PC connected. The range-topping model looks pretty good, with 4K resolution, 95% coverage of DCI-P3, and an included magnetic webcam with 1080p resolution. It seems to be meant to compete with the Samsung Smart Monitor M8.\nOne model that really got my attention is meant to look more like part of your furniture than a monitor. LG said it's a good choice for a shared space like a living room, which makes total sense. This model doesn't have a typical stand; instead, the base is directly at the bottom of the display, which kind of makes it look more like a TV. If I were to have a family PC in the living room, I think this screen would be a perfect fit for something like that.\nAt the bottom of the lineup, there's another somewhat interesting model, mostly because it comes in different colors. Most of the others are only white, but this one comes in green, pink, or black, which I really appreciate. I'd like to see more vibrant colors, but it's still nice.\nAside from these, LG was also showing off its other monitor models, which are just refreshes of existing ones.\nLG CineBeam Qube projector\nTiny but versatile\nThe last of the proper products I got to check out from LG was the excellent-looking Qube mini projector. LG had it side-by-side with Samsung's The Freestyle, and it won in pretty much every metric, except maybe aesthetics. Still, the Qube is a tiny projector running webOS, and it boasts 4K resolution support, along with display sizes up to 120 inches. LG tells me this is the only projector of this size that supports 4K resolution and images up to 120 inches in size. The image quality of the Qube next to the Freestyle (first generation) is night and day, with much better white levels and more vibrant colors.\nWhile it's not the most visually appealing, the design of the Qube is pretty clever, with a fully rotating kickstand that doubles as a handle for easy portability. It can also be mounted on a taller stand if you need the extra height in your space. The projector also has automatic correction, adjusting the image based on the surface it's pointing at.\nThere's no official wording on price or availability for the Qube, but hopefully it's coming sooner rather than later.\nLG's booth\nA tunnel of screens, transparent displays, and some interesting concepts\nThings got wild when you just looked at the LG booth on the convention floor. Walking from the concourse into the Central Hall, you're immediately greeted by a giant wall of wireless transparent TVs. The TVs move around and, of course, let you see right through them. The transparency is pretty subtle, but it was enough to attract huge crowds pretty much every day I passed by, and it was pretty cool to see people on the other side of the screen. LG also had a transparent display by itself in another part of the booth.\nBut that's not the only crazy display showcase LG had at CES. Off to the left side, LG had a tunnel that, on the inside, was almost entirely made of screens. Once inside, the videos that were playing completely enveloped us, and it made for a very fun experience, if only a bit short. Even then, there was always a line of people wanting to enter the tunnel.\nThere was a bunch more stuff at the booth. One thing that really got my attention was this concept for a trailer featuring a bunch of LG technology. It was pretty crazy, because this was a very compact trailer, yet it had a bed, two pull-out tables, a bathroom with a shower, a sink, a coat hanger (LG's own Styler, no less), storage for bottles and glasses, and a screen on the door showing weather information. You shouldn't expect this to become a real product, but it was just neat to see. There was also a concept for a smart car of some kind, which also looked cool.\nOne part that made me kind of envious was a shelf at the booth with a bunch of products and concepts, including the LG Gram Fold, which seems to be the best foldable laptop you can buy, at least specs-wise. Sadly, there was a \"do not touch\" sign on it, and even though I asked, I couldn't get closer to it. Another cool concept nearby was the DukeBox, a music player with a screen that feels like it's floating on a coffee table. Again, it was just a concept, but most fun things are.\nOtherwise, LG had a few other sections. Some parts were focused on accessibility with some accessories like handles for washing machines and fridges. Others were focused on sustainability or smart homes that highlighted certain capabilities, like voice recognition, so smart devices can respond to different people accordingly. This section didn't really get my attention like some of the others, though.\nAll in all, though, LG was one of the coolest companies to check out at the show, and that seems to be the case often. Between some cool new products and some wild concepts, it was one of the most popular booths.\nXDA Newsletter\nBy subscribing, you agree to our Privacy Policy and may receive occasional deal communications; you can unsubscribe anytime.\nI've been covering the tech world for over 5 years, with a heavy focus on laptops and the Windows ecosystem.

Under the theme of \"Reinvent your future,\" LG's exhibition presents how the company will elevate customer experiences in everyday lives through its latest innovations \u2013 including the transparent and wireless 4K LG SIGNATURE OLED TV; a smart home powered by artificial intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT) and communication technologies; and the mobility concept Alpha-able.\nThe Ultimate TV Experience With Innovative Technology and Infinite ContentThe heart of LG's booth is the world's first transparent and wireless 4K OLED TV, the LG SIGNATURE OLED T. Visitors are greeted by a massive media art display created by combining fifteen 77-inch OLED Ts, showcasing captivating video content with perfect black levels and vibrant colors. These displays gradually transform into a transparent OLED TV, revealing a new era uncovered by OLED T. The floating appearance of the OLED TVs emphasizes the wireless transmission of video and audio signals and connection to external devices, simplifying installation and providing more freedom in interior design.\nA dedicated zone highlights the LG SIGNATURE OLED T's transparent and wireless technology, which allows the TV to exceed the constraints of space and seamlessly blend into everyday life. Serving as a TV that complements the interior design of any space, the LG SIGNATURE OLED T offers an extension of future living experiences. Additionally, the transparent screen enhances the viewing experience of media artworks by adding depth and dimensionality.\nMoving on to the next zone, visitors encounter an impressive tunnel structure featuring over 140 55-inch OLED displays. This webOS experience Zone serves as a platform to showcase an extensive range of content, curated through collaborations with diverse partners. An invitation to explore the world of entertainment powered by webOS platform, the webOS Zone treats guests to an extensive collection of video clips from a diverse range of genres, including highly anticipated series, games or sports. This immersive experience invites visitors to explore and indulge in the world of webOS, offering a captivating and interactive journey.\nAI Technology Enhancing the 'Smart Life Solution' ExperienceIn the smart home exhibition zone, LG presents how AI technology can enhance its future smart life solutions. The company's AI-powered smart home utilizes various sensors to not only digitize people's lives but also proactively detect needs as well as propose tailored solutions based on customers' words, actions and even emotions.\nFor example, the non-contact sensors installed in the house can measure and digitize customers' heart and breathing rate, analyzing their health status to automatically adjust the indoor temperature and humidity.\nIn the future smart home, LG ThinQ will connect sensors and IoT devices installed throughout the home, acting as a service platform that autonomously controls the devices to ensure ideal settings without the need for customer intervention.\nIf, perhaps, a customer brings home a new pet cat, the microphones, cameras and mmWave sensors embedded in household devices detect the furry friend's presence, automatically asking whether to download the 'pet mode' on LG ThinQ UP home appliances or recommending accessory kits specifically for pets. Additionally, the sensors even prioritize energy efficiency by switching smart products in unoccupied rooms to power-saving mode or turning them off when no one is home. The sensors can even activate crime prevention mode, sending notifications through the LG ThinQ app if any unusual activity is detected.\nThe zone also introduces the newly unveiled smart home AI agent, which moves on its own two wheels to welcome visitors. This AI agent serves as a versatile household assistant and a smart hub, offering comprehensive support in customers' daily lives by connecting and managing household appliances and IoT devices. Equipped with a camera, speaker and a range of home monitoring sensors, it can gather real-time data of the home environment to facilitate appliance control. Its front display allows for expressive facial expressions, actively engaging and communicating with customers.\nThe commercial zone showcases a variety of customized services connected under the theme of traveling in Las Vegas. One notable example is the integration of LG MAGNIT, a Micro LED Display, with facial recognition and AI advertising solutions. This combination allows for personalized advertisements to be delivered to users in various locations, such as hotels, retail spaces and transportation areas. Other scenarios include customers receiving guidance from the GuideBot at a hotel or making payments through facial recognition at a cafe.\nAlpha-able, LG's Future Mobility ConceptGoing beyond the home, LG recently redefined future cars as a \"personalized digital cave.\" To demonstrate this concept, the company established a dedicated zone featuring Alpha-able within its exhibition space. Alpha-able serves as a tangible representation of LG's mobility vision, offering passengers a preview of the innovative solutions they can expect to experience in the future mobility environment.\nThe future mobility concept aims to deliver unique customer experiences based on three themes: Transformable, Explorable and Relaxable. By transforming the car into spaces reminiscent of home or office environments, passengers can find rest or work on the go. Alpha-able utilizes cutting-edge display technologies, including rollable, flexible and transparent displays, along with LG's unrivaled home appliance technologies and solutions, to provide Transformable experiences that adapt to passengers' needs. Additionally, Alpha-able offers Explorable experiences by delivering tailored information and content for unique situations, as well as Relaxable experiences for passengers to unwind and enjoy some personal time.\nIn addition to Alpha-able, LG has also dedicated a zone to showcase its electric vehicle (EV) charging solutions, a key growth area for the company. This zone highlights LG's EV charger and control solution called e-Centric.\nExperimental yet Innovative LG Labs and Sustainable Solutions Aligned Under ESG VisionLG also unveiled a range of new products developed through LG Labs, the company's experimental yet innovative product and services development project focused on creating unique customer experiences.\nThe LG Labs zone showcases a range of innovative products, including DukeBox by LG Labs, the all-in-one audio device seeking to reinvent the depth of audio and video experience with a modernized jukebox concept; DUOBO by LG Labs, a capsule coffee machine that extracts two flavors at once; and Bon Voyage by LG Labs, a customized living space designed to extend the life quality at home to nature. In addition, the zone includes products like LG CineBeam Qube and brid.zzz by LG Labs, which offer bold and innovative approaches to elevate the customer experience.\nThe company also set up the Better Life for All zone, dedicated to highlighting its efforts in environmental, social and governance initiatives. A notable feature in this zone was the LG mycup, a tumbler washer that made its debut at CES. Furthermore, LG presented its sustainable home solution, leveraging the capabilities of LG's home energy platform to optimize energy management and utilization. This comprehensive solution offers users efficient usage, easy control and the ability to distribute renewable energy.\nIn addition, LG presented its 'Universal UP Kit', a range of accessories designed to assist all users in conveniently operating LG home appliances, regardless of gender, age or disabilities. Visitors had the opportunity to experience these accessories firsthand. The company also placed a strong emphasis on accessibility for everyone through its TV accessibility experiences.\nVisitors can experience LG's latest innovations at its CES booth (#16008, Las Vegas Convention Center) from January 9-12.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024 day 3: the 9 best gadgets we've seen, from the LG C4 OLED to neural headphones\nOur highlights from another eventful day at CES 2024\nIt may already be day three of CES 2024, but the tech announcements show no sign of slowing down \u2013 in fact, after hours of scouring the show floor, we're discovering more hidden gems than ever after the big keynote announcements earlier this week.\nWe've already rounded up the best smart home tech of CES 2024 and the best wearable and fitness tech from the show, but what about some of our more left-field findings? You'll find some of the best ones below, including one of the best bits if AI hardware so far, some fascinating neural headphones and a wearable oven (yes, really).\nIt hasn't all been tech eccentricities, though, because we've also found time to get eyes-on with the LG C4 OLED TV (spoiler: it'll probably be one of 2024's best TVs) and a promisingly affordable 100-inch screen from Hisense. All via a smart, eco-friendly hairdryer from Loreal, of course.\nFor a quick blast of some of the most intriguing tech of the year, read on for all of our highlights from day three of CES 2024.\n1. LG C4 OLED TV\nTransparent OLED TVs may be all the rage at CES 2024, but the ones we're actually going to buy are more like the new LG C4 OLED \u2013 and our eyes-on time with it suggests the C4 going to be one to watch (quite literally) again this year.\nLG claimed in its CES announcement that the LG C4 would be brighter than last year's LG C3, despite using the same OLED panel. We were a little dubious, but our brief time with the set (which you can read more about in our hands-on LG C4 review confirmed) confirmed that its brightness boost is indeed very real.\nCombine this with processing improvements, including the addition of\u00a0LG's lossless wireless Dolby Atmos sound, and you have a TV that we can't wait to get in for proper testing this year to see how it compares to the best OLED TVs.\n2. Rabbit R1\nSmartphones have now devoured most handheld gadgets, but a new AI-powered one is making waves at CES 2024. The Rabbit R1 is the first genuinely interesting bit of AI hardware (more so than the strange Humane AI Pin) that we've seen since the ChatGPT explosion started just over a year ago \u2013 and it might be a glimpse of next-gen voice assistants.\nWhat does the Rabbit R1 do? We'd recommend watching the R1 launch video (which was clearly influenced by the original iPhone launch) for a longer explanation, but it's essentially a tool for talking to your favorite apps using natural language. Rather than swiping between different phone apps, you create 'rabbits' that can carry out tasks \u2013 like booking a flight or doing your shopping\u00a0\u2013 using your voice commands.\nWe doubt very much that the R1 will be replacing smartphones, but it does have a point about today's archaic app-swiping experience \u2013\u00a0and it's a solid blueprint for how a next-gen Siri or Google Assistant might use AI.\n3. Amazfit Helio Ring\nWe're still waiting for the long-rumored Samsung Galaxy Ring, but in the meantime Amazfit has announced another contender for the title of best smart ring at CES 2024 called the Helio Ring.\nLike the Oura Ring, Amazfit's rival promises to serve up detailed sleep tracking and recovery stats from your workouts. You'll seemingly be able to take the Helio Ring swimming or in downpours too, as it's water-resistant to 100m. And like the best Garmin watches, it'll also give you a daily Readiness score based based on your exertions and sleep.\nWe don't yet have a price or release date for the Helio Ring yet \u2013\u00a0and you will unfortunately need a monthly subscription to unlock all of its features \u2013\u00a0but it's one we're very keen to try out later this year.\n4. Neural headphones\nRather than a single product, neural headphones are instead a fascinating new tech genre that we've seen several examples of at CES 2024. By tapping into auditory nerves, these cans can effectively read your mind, giving you hands-free control of your tech or boosting your ability to relax.\nWe checked out four examples of neural headphones at CES and all of them bring their own spin on the concept. The Naqi Neural Earbuds, for example, were developed as an alternative to brain implants, and give you control over your Windows or Mac computer. The NeurGear ZenBuds, meanwhile, stimulate your Vagus nerve to trigger a rest response.\nWith other examples like the Earable Neuroscience Frenz Brainband ($490, ships in February 2024) planning to help us fall and stay asleep, it's definitely a big tech trend to watch this year.\n5. Kohler Anthem Plus\nThe shower might be last place that you want to be colonized by tech, but our time with Kohler's Anthem Plus Digital Control has convinced us of the benefits of 'digital showering'.\nThis touch-sensitive controller pairs with a digital thermostatic valve to give you a gloriously multi-sensory showering experience that lets you customize the water, light, sound, and even the\u00a0steam. It isn't cheap, starting at $2,800 (around \u00a32,200 / AU$4,180), but you could probably start charging visitors for showers.\n6. Hisense 110UX ULED TV\nYou can't call it a day at CES without seeing some truly massive TVs and Hisense didn't disappoint us on day three of the show, showing us its mini-LED lineup for 2024 \u2013\u00a0include a 110in whopper.\nThe 110UX is shaping up to be an impressive set all round, despite its size, with 40,000 local dimming zones and a scorching 10,000 nits brightness. On the audio front, you also get a built-in 4.2.2-channel speaker system that's bolstered by the new Dolby Atmos FlexConnect wireless audio tech.\nBut if you've measured up and don't quite have room for a 110-inch TV, Hisense will also be launching 100-inch regular QLED model in 2024 \u2013\u00a0and if history is any guide, that model will be impressively affordable for its size.\n7. Willtex Willcook wearable oven\nOne of the phrases we didn't expect to encounter today was 'wearable oven', but CES has a habit of surprising us \u2013\u00a0and sure enough, we found ourselves on the show floor trying a backpack that can cook food.\nOkay, the Willcook isn't an oven in the traditional sense, but it does have a thin mesh fabric that its maker calls an \"embedded heat ray.\" After putting our hand inside, we can attest \u2013 this thing does get hot enough to slow-cook food (even meat, fish and curry) while you're on the move.\nThe idea is that you could cook dinner while on the way back from work or while you're on-the-go on a camping trip. We reckon the tech might have better applications in a winter coat (which was another prototype that Willtex showed us), but the wearable oven will go on sale in the US in September for around $200.\n8. Bluetooth Auracast\nIf you don't know much about Bluetooth Auracast, you can expect to hear a lot more about it in 2024. The wireless tech \u2013\u00a0which means your compatible wireless headphones aren't just limited to the devices you're paired with \u2013\u00a0is starting to roll out on everything from portable speakers like the JBL Clip 5 to Samsung's 4K TVs and earbuds.\nBut our demo showed us some practical applications that we're excited about. For example, you could be in a sports bar watching a TV that you could tune into without needing to do any pairing. Or you could be in an airport getting departure announcements beamed straight to your ears so you don't miss the last call.\nIn future, Auracast should also let you tune into two streams at once, letting you watch a TV while still getting the airport gate announcements when they're made. We'll need more devices to support it, but Auracast could change the way we use headphones.\n9. L'Oreal AirLight Pro\nHow smart can a hairdryer really get? Well, if you've been eyeing up the Dyson Supersonic, you'll definitely be interested in the Loreal AirLight Pro. It combines a bunch of impressive tech advances that make it both super-efficient and eco-friendly, and also smart enough to please your inner gadget fan.\nThat efficiency, which apparently allows the Airlight Pro to use 30% less power than a traditional hair dryer, comes from its combination of air and infrared heating elements, which make it a bit like drying your hair in the sun and wind. Impressively, it can also recognize attachments and then adjust settings based on which one you've fitted.\nNaturally, the Airlight Pro is also app-connected (for Android and iOS devices), which lets you make further tweaks and customs settings on your phone. Read our hands-on report below, which might just convince you that Loreal's hairdryer is worth the roughly $400 (about \u00a3315) that it'll cost when it goes on sale in June (in Europe) and in the US before the end of 2024.\nWe\u2019re covering all of the latest CES news from the show as it happens. Stick with us for the big stories on everything from 8K TVs and foldable displays to new phones, laptops, smart home gadgets, and the latest in AI.\nAnd don\u2019t forget to follow us on TikTok for the latest from the CES show floor!\nYou might also like\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nMark is TechRadar's Senior news editor.

Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

Read our full LG G4 hands-on review\nPanasonic Z95A flagship OLED TV hands-on review Panasonic's flagship Z95A for 2024 seems very similar to the wonderful\u00a0MZ2000 it replaces but adds some neat upgrades, including a second-gen\u00a0MLA\u00a0OLED panel that, together with upgraded processing and a new heat management system, results in brighter picture performance.

Well, if you believe what several major brands are saying at CES 2024, flatscreen IQs are set to go up a level this year thanks to \u2013 yep, you guessed it \u2013 AI processing.

Read our full Samsung QN900D hands-on review\nI've seen the 115-inch TCL Mini LED TV in action and now I want it\nI've been watching this rise of massive TVs with keen interest, and when TCL announced the most massive Mini LED TV yet at\u00a0CES 2024, I just had to go and check it out for myself. Let's just say I wasn't disappointed \u2013 at least not until I was told the price. Read the full TCL Mini LED TV opinion\nI saw Fiio\u2019s cassette player at CES 2024 and it had me feeling warm, fuzzy and frustrated\nI\u2019ve just spent the past six days navigating my way through all manner of high-tech kit at CES 2024, but it's the CP13 cassette player that put the biggest smile on my face. Walking up to it, I immediately had a couple of flashbacks to my childhood, spending an unhealthy amount of time with my old Sony Walkman. Is this an excuse to dust off your tape collection? Read the full Fiio CP13 cassette player opinion\nSamsung's new duo of small OLED TVs could spell trouble for LG \u2013 here's why Samsung has announced a new 42-inch TV and a 48-inch TV as part of its new lineup, which is easily one of the most interesting news out of CES 2024 in my eyes, and for one good reason. Put simply, it should teach LG that it can't rest on its laurels with the C-series any more. Read the full Samsung small OLED opinion\nForget transparent TVs \u2013 CES 2024 should have been about cheap OLEDs\nI applaud LG and Samsung\u2019s ambition, but I\u2019d rather see both focus on making TVs more affordable, especially during a cost-of-living crisis. I can\u2019t help but wish the companies had paid a little more time, attention and effort to helping bring OLED display tech, and top-end TV experiences in general, to more affordable prices. Read the full transparent TV opinion\nJBL revealed plenty of Bluetooth speakers at CES 2024 - but there's one glaring omission\nJBL announced a trio of Auracast-enabled Bluetooth speakers \u2013 the miniature Clip 5, the even dinkier Go 4 and the much-anticipated, very powerful,\u00a0Xtreme 4 \u2013 but where's the Flip 7?

Read the full JBL Flip 7 opinion\nTCL and Hisense may have fixed my biggest gripe with 100-inch TVs\nThere's something notable that differentiates TCL and Hisense from LG and Samsung where large-screen efforts are concerned. The former have created bespoke massive TVs while others have simply scaled up existing sets, and I certainly prefer one approach over the other... Read the full TCL and Hisense opinion\nCES 2024 proves Samsung and LG's best OLED TV tech isn\u2019t going down in price anytime soon\nWhile our team reporting from the showroom floor found plenty to get excited about with huge TVs and new OLED sets, one sad fact became increasingly apparent \u2013 it doesn\u2019t look like the top-of-the-line MLA or QD-OLED panels seen on last year\u2019s flagships are going down in price any time soon. Read the full OLED TV tech opinion\nThe world is crying out for Samsung The Frame rivals \u2013 where's your imagination, Sony et al?

Last year, it introduced a wireless OLED TV in the form of the\u00a0M3 OLED\u00a0\u2013 so how has it upstaged that?

It's also launched the UBoom X portable Bluetooth speaker, which sports 30 hours, IP67 rating and can charge your phone too.\nRead the full EarFun story\nCES 2024 preview: what to expect\nSony at CES 2024\nSony probably won\u2019t announce anything, at least not in our worlds of hi-fi and AV. In 2023, it announced its new TVs at a separate event in March and instead, opted to focus on PlayStation VR 2 and its automotive partnership with Honda at CES.\nThe holding image on Sony's website suggests the company will focus on movie production, sound and VR at CES 2024 while we are expecting its TV launches to follow a similar pattern to last year.\nWhen Sony does announce its new TVs, we expect to see a new QD-OLED model to replace the A95L, and presumably a new standard OLED model to replace the A80L. We predict these new models could be titled A95M and A80M respectively. On top of this, we also expect to see more backlit LCD models.\nPress conference: 8th January, 01:00 am GMT Livestream: Sony CES Press Conference\nPanasonic at CES 2024\nTraditionally, Panasonic tends to only announce its flagship TV at CES and we have no reason to expect a deviation from that approach this year.\nIn all likelihood, Panasonic's 2024 flagship, which will replace the MZ2000, will be called the NZ2000, and it will almost certainly be an MLA OLED model with a substantial Dolby Atmos sound system.\nConsidering our experience testing the MZ2000 this year, we'll be curious to see if the newer set takes further advantage of MLA's brightness-boosting powers and potential improvements to the TV's sound system.\nStay tuned for more information!\nPress conference: 8th January, 6:00 pm GMT Livestream: Panasonic CES Homepage\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung will be in attendance and will be sure to announce new products but we\u2019re not yet sure exactly what those will be.\nSmaller QD-OLED panels are now available so we could see new, smaller QD-OLED TVs (the current smallest are 55 inches) and there could be more \u2018standard\u2019 OLEDs that use panels from LG.\nIn 2023, Samsung released its first TV that uses a standard LG OLED panel. It has long been predicted that the company will use those panels to release more and cheaper OLEDs, so we could see these at CES 2024.\nThe company will also almost certainly announce a new range of Neo QLED TVs that use Quantum Dots with Mini LED backlighting. And don't forget 8K QLED models \u2013 unlike most other major TV brands, Samsung is still very focused on 8K.\nFinally, we can also expect to see a new range of absolutely huge and ridiculously expensive Micro LED displays, as Samsung appears to be betting big on this as the TV technology of the future. Will this be the year that it announces a model small enough to fit into the average home and affordable enough to be purchased by the average person? We highly doubt it.\nPress conference: 8th January, 10:00 pm GMT Livestream: Samsung Newsroom\nLG at CES 2024\nLG goes bigger than most brands at CES, and we don't expect 2024 to be any different.\nIn fact, we now know that new B4, C4, G4 and M4 models are definitely on the way. Firstly thanks to a leak confirming the resolutions and refresh rates (4K/120Hz for the B4, 4K/144Hz for the C4 and G4), and then through an official announcement. We also know that all of the upcoming LG TVs will include free updates for at least five years.\nThe M4 and G4 TVs will launch with an entirely new Alpha 11 AI processor, whereas the C4 will instead include an upgraded version of the previous Alpha 9 chip. The B4 will receive a new processor in the form of the Alpha 8 AI Processor.\nWe were looking forward to finding out whether the brightness-boosting MLA technology that debuted in the G3 in 2023 would trickle down to the mainstream C4 model this year. Unfortunately with the latest information announcement, that does not seem to be the case.\nMuch like the M3 OLED TV announced in 2023, the upcoming M4 features a wireless Zero Connect Box to house internal components and port selection. We'd personally like to see the return of the brand's 'Wallpaper' range of insanely thin TVs that could be hung on the wall using magnets, but alas, no signs are pointing that way at present.\nLG has already taken the wraps off its cute little CineBeam Qube 4K projector and wireless Dolby Atmos soundbars, so expect more details on both.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT Livestream: LG Global YouTube\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense recently unveiled its upcoming 110-inch Mini LED TV, set to be shown off in full at CES 2024.\nThe company has shared some impressive specifications for the TV, including 10,000 nits peak brightness and 40,000 backlight zones. Due to the screen's size, Hisense is well aware that viewers may not be watching it straight-on. To combat this issue, Hisense has fitted the 110-inch TV with STW2.0 wide-angle film technology which should reduce glare, backlight leakage and general picture anomalies that come with viewing a screen of this size from an angle.\nWe're hoping to see some slightly more reasonable TVs from the brand at CES as well.\nPress conference: 8th January, 4:00 pm GMT Livestream: Hisense at CES 2024\nFiiO at CES 2024\nFiiO is expected to show off its upcoming R9 all-in-one desktop system at CES.\nThe R9 is desktop a hi-fi system/DAC/headphone amplifier that represents a step up from the R7 which was released in early 2023. FiiO's new R9 player can deliver hi-res audio to active speakers, and headphones.\nIt also features a large colour display, a range of input choices, including HDMI, and support for streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and Roon to name a few.\nWe're looking forward to a hands-on experience with the R9 and the rest of FiiO's range in January.\nSennheiser at CES 2024\nSennheiser usually reveals new products at CES and 2024 looks to be no different. In 2023, for example, we saw the debut of its IE 200 earbuds.\nNot much is known about its 2024 plans although a 'Headphone Launch Event' holding video on the Sennheiser YouTube page has been spotted, meaning the brand has at least one new pair up its sleeve at the very least. But are they in-ear or over-ear? Wired or wireless? We'll have to wait and find out.\nPress conference: 8th January, 8:30 pm GMT Livestream: Sennheiser Launch Event at CES 2024\nAudio Pro at CES 2024\nSwedish brand Audio Pro has revealed that it will be showing off a new flagship wireless speaker model at CES.\nAudio Pro has been tight-lipped regarding the major details. However, we do know the new speaker will follow suit of previous models and feature support for streaming via Spotify Connect and Tidal Connect, as well as offer support for AirPlay2 and Google Cast.\nWe have rated previous Audio Pro speakers \u2013 such as the Addon C3 \u2013 highly for their refined sound and impressive timing. The brand has also hinted at a few extra surprises in its new model that will make it stand out from the crowd even more... Our interest is collectively piqued.\nOthers at CES 2024\nJBL (and other Harman brands) usually launch new products at CES, and some of JBL's forthcoming products have won awards. The JBL Authentics 500 picked up a Best of Innovation award for its combination of retro styling and Dolby Atmos sound tech, while the lower-specced Authentics 200 and 300, and JBL's in-car Club Series speakers were all honourees.\nIn terms of trends we can expect to see, our money is on more streaming turntables, more wireless earbuds (and potentially an innovation), and a focus on spatial audio across the board.\nCES 2024 dates: when is CES?\nCES takes place this week, between Tuesday 9th and Friday 12th January 2024 in Las Vegas, though the 'Media Days', when most product news is announced, are held two days prior, over the Sunday 7th and Monday 8th of January. These are the two days you'll want to keep your eye on whathifi.com if you want to hear all the latest announcements as they happen.\nThe CES 2024 schedule can be viewed here\nCES 2023 highlights: what impressed last time?\nLG\u2019s MLA technology\nThe LG G3 TV and the arrival of MLA technology were definitely big highlights of CES 2023. LG Display\u2019s use of Micro Lens Array (MLA) has meant that its OLED TVs have reached dazzlingly bright heights this year.\nIn a nutshell, MLA is made of a layer of microscopic lenses that are layered on top of the OLED pixels. To contextualise how microscopic these lenses are, LG Display claims that it can fit 5000 microlenses on a single pixel.\nI've tested the latest MLA-OLED TV and the upgrades aren't as game-changing as I'd hoped\nLG M3 wireless OLED TV\nLG's impressive wireless M3 4K OLED TV got its world-first showing at CES 2023. A wireless 4K OLED TV? You had better believe it!\nWhile the M3 does require a power cable, it receives video and audio content totally wirelessly via a separate transmitter box. No tangles of HDMI cables dangling from the back of the TV. LG calls its proprietary tech 'Zero Connect' and, following the tech demo at CES, the M3 hit store shelves in the second half of 2023.\nJBL TT350\nAt CES 2023, JBL announced its Classic Series of hi-fi components that includes a music streamer, amplifier, CD player, and the brand's first-ever turntable, the JBL TT350 Classic.\nThe TT350 sports a direct drive design with a heavy die-cast aluminium platter set in a natural walnut wood veneered chassis. It also comes with adjustable dampened feet to help cut down on vibrations and enable you to play the TT350 on uneven surfaces. Its S-shaped, curved aluminium tonearm is fitted with a \"high quality\" Audio Technica moving magnet cartridge in a removable headshell.\nNaim NAP250 Power amplifier\nNaim celebrated its 50th anniversary at CES 2023, revealing a range of new components including the NAP 250 power amplifier.\nIt is the sixth generation of this product, which has been going since 1975, and it\u2019s one of the best products the brand has made over those five decades. It features some tech that has trickled down from Naim's flagship Statement amplifier, such as an eddy-current circuit breaker between speaker outputs and balanced XLR connections, alongside Naim's promise of \"more power, even better performance, and greater system-matching flexibility\".\nNakamichi Dragon soundbar\nFeaturing an impressive 21 channels of audio, the Nakamichi Dragon soundbar definitely turned heads at CES. It\u2019s also the first bar to support DTS:X Pro as well.\nThe Dragon is a huge 11.4.6-channel soundbar that measures 58 inches and features 31 drivers \u2013 six upfiring, four main soundbar drivers, two 2D Omni-Motion Reference Surround speakers and four subwoofers. Each surround speaker is fitted with two three-inch drivers and an Air Motion Transfer tweeter, too. Plus, the Dragon supports Dolby Atmos, Dolby Vision, and aptX HD.\nPanasonic MZ2000 OLED TV\nAt CES 2023, Panasonic showed off what it described as its \"best and brightest picture\" ever courtesy of its MZ2000 OLED TV.\nIt features a custom OLED panel powered by Panasonic's HCX Pro AI processor, a multi-layer heat management system, and MLA technology. These new features reportedly have improved max brightness by a massive 150% over the previous year\u2019s model, bringing the total peak brightness to around 1500 nits.\nIt also comes packed with a Technics-tuned Dolby Atmos audio system with multiple built-in upward-firing, side-firing, and front-firing speakers. The front speaker array runs the entire length of the TV and has been revised to come with a wider soundstage alongside a variety of different listening modes.\nJBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers system\nJBL was in the spotlight once again, this time with its 4329P all-in-one speaker system with streaming powers: the JBL 4329P Studio Monitor speakers.\nIt's a pair of active loudspeakers featuring what JBL described as \u201cextensive wired and wireless connectivity options\" alongside built-in Digital Signal Processing and the brand's now-iconic horn-loaded compression drivers. Each speaker is powered by a 300W amp, with 250W being delivered to the 8-inch paper cone woofer and 50W going to the 1-inch compression driver.\nThe good news doesn\u2019t stop there though, as the 4329P come with wi-fi and ethernet, built-in Chromecast, AirPlay 2, Bluetooth 5.3, and aptX Adaptive support. There's also a built-in DAC to enable hi-res music playback support up to 24-bit/192KHz, as well as MQA support and Roon Ready certification.\nMORE:\nSamsung Galaxy S24: rumours, leaks and expected release date\nAirPods not working?

Here\u2019s how it works.\nStars of CES 2024: the 11 best TV and audio products we saw this week\nOur pick of the best products announced at the tech show\nIt\u2019s just about time for CES 2024 to close its doors for another year, after what has been a busy week packed full of exciting hi-fi and AV announcements.\nAs has become increasingly the case at CES, TV news has come thick and fast over the last few days \u2013 from cool concept sets to the new ranges we\u2019ll be seeing in our testing rooms in just a few months.\nBut there\u2019s also been some great hi-fi to get us talking too, from turntables to true wireless earbuds, though of course it wouldn\u2019t be CES without an expensive speaker system or two thrown in for good luck.\nWe\u2019ve certainly not been short of products to get round at the show, but we\u2019ve put in the steps and whittled down the 11 most exciting products to crown our Best of CES 2024. Which products made the cut? You\u2019d better keep reading\u2026\nLG OLED T\nIt wouldn't be CES without some crazy concept TVs, and LG is almost always the manufacturer delivering them. Following in the footsteps of its rollable OLED \u2013 the LG OLED R \u2013 the new Signature OLED T is about as futuristic as it gets.\nIt\u2019s a transparent OLED TV, and while the concept isn\u2019t entirely new, they\u2019ve only been proof of concepts before. This is a viable product that will sit within LG\u2019s fancy Signature Series, in all its see-through glory.\nIt features a transparent OLED panel up front, which means you can literally see what is sitting behind it, with a rollable opaque film that LG is calling a \"contrast screen\". Engage that and you\u2019ll get a more traditional OLED TV experience; roll it down and the TV almost disappears into your d\u00e9cor around it.\nIt will use the same wireless technology and processor as the new M4 Wireless OLED TV, with the Zero Connect box beaming sound and images wirelessly to the see-through screen and sound system. It will also run the latest version of webOS, as is the case with all LG's 2024 TVs.\nNo pricing yet but you know the drill. Expect expensive, because it almost certainly will be.\nPanasonic Z95A\nPanasonic\u2019s flagship TV for the year usually breaks cover at CES, and that\u2019s been no different in 2024, with What Hi-Fi? able to get its eyes on the new range-topper for this year, the Panasonic Z95A.\nIt comes with something of a surprise up its sleeve, which is that Panasonic has nixed its own My Home Screen operating system in favour of Amazon\u2019s Fire OS \u2013 a first in its flagship sets, but that should ensure all the streaming services you\u2019ll want are present and correct. Not something we could always say about its predecessor.\nThe Z95A uses the same MLA-packing Master OLED Ultimate panel as the outgoing MZ2000 but there are brightness improvements here thanks to more efficient processing and improved heat management.\nThat\u2019s in part thanks to a new processor, the HCX Pro AI Processor MK II, which promises to elevate picture clarity through its 4K Remaster Engine, with a reduction on banding too, through improved gradation.\nIt also helps to power an upgrade from Dolby Vision IQ to Dolby Vision IQ with Precision Detail, which should result in a slightly crisper Dolby Vision performance, plus there\u2019s support for 144Hz gaming in Dolby Vision too.\nIt\u2019ll be available in 55- and 65-inch screen sizes, and with our hands-on first impressions throwing around words like \u201cstunning\u201d, \u201ccinematic\u201d and \u201cstrikingly impressive\u201d, we\u2019re excited to see more.\nTCL 115QM89\nCES 2024 saw its fair share of super-sized TVs, but TCL\u2019s 115-inch QM89 takes the biscuit.\nNot only is it absolutely huge, but it's also got some pretty incredible numbers on its spec sheet.\nThe biggest of those is 20,000, which is the number of separate dimming zones the Mini LED backlight is split into. That's astonishing, and should allow the QM89 to produce strong contrast even across that massive display area.\nThat\u2019s joined by a jaw-dropping peak brightness of over 5000 nits. That beats the strides forward in this area made by the likes of Samsung and Sony hands down.\nYou can also add support for 4K/120Hz and 4K/144Hz gaming (though the panel itself is 120Hz) to those numbers, as well as 6.2.2 \u2013 the number of channels in the built-in sound system that includes dedicated up-firing speakers and\u00a0Dolby Atmos\u00a0support.\nOur TV and AV editor Tom Parsons has clapped eyes on the impressive set for some first impressions, and is already preparing to convert his garage to accommodate it. Now all he needs is the \u201cunder $20,000\u201d for the price tag it\u2019s likely to launch with.\nHisense ULED X\nHisense used CES 2024 to test the waters with some of its more conceptual products, including its new ULED X range.\nThis is Hisense's most premium TV collection, and as such, makes use of its most high-end screen technology and feature sets. If you thought the TCL numbers were impressive, wait until you hear what Hisense has up its sleeve.\nFor its flagship 110-inch 110UX, it features a whopping 40,000 backlighting zones and 10,000 nits of brightness \u2013 double that which TCL has to offer.\nThis is joined by the 98UX, which reduces the dimming zones to 10,000, but packs a TCL-matching 5000 nits of brightness, with both the 110UX and 98UX featuring a 4.2.2 integrated sound system and Dolby Atmos FlexConnect compatibility.\nIf you can\u2019t quite accommodate a massive TV of these dimensions, the 75UX also got a mention. It\u2019s Hisense\u2019s thinnest Mini LED yet, measuring just 14 millimetres deep. This will come with 5000 dimming zones and the aforementioned 4.2.2 built-in speaker system, but loses the support for Dolby Atmos Flex Connect.\nPricing and availability is still TBC, but we\u2019re excited to see more soon.\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nWe loved the Sennheiser Momentum True Wireless 3 when we reviewed them in 2022. In fact, we\u2019ve loved this range since its inception, dishing out a five-star review every time we\u2019ve seen a new addition to the lineup.\nIt\u2019s no wonder, then, that we\u2019re excited about the new Momentum True Wireless 4. Promising a \"larger-than-life sound\", some of the improvements here include better ANC, longer battery life of up to 7.5 hours on a single charge (with 30 hours in the case) and\u00a0Auracast support.\nThere's also support for Qualcomm's S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound Technology for aptX lossless codec and ultra-low latency capabilities when streaming via Bluetooth.\nThese smart buds will be available to pre-order on February 15th in a choice of black copper, metallic silver and graphite, and will cost \u00a3260 / \u20ac300 / $299.95 / AU$499.95.\nVictrola Stream Sapphire\nLast year\u2019s Victrola Stream Carbon caught our eye with its Works with Sonos capabilities, but this year\u2019s Stream Sapphire takes that wireless functionality a few steps further. Consider us intrigued.\nNot only can you stream your vinyl to any Sonos kit in your house, but the Stream Sapphire also includes UPnP and Roon support too, enabling playback to literally thousands of compatible devices, including AV receivers, speakers and TVs. It\u2019ll even support up to 24-bit/48kHz lossless FLAC audio streams too.\nThese impressive feature upgrades are supported by an improved design too, with a bespoke walnut veneer for its MDF plinth, an upgraded brushless motor for quiet playback and an audiophile-grade Ortofon 2M Blue cartridge.\nOf course, you can still use the Stream Sapphire in a more traditional set-up, with gold-plated RCA outputs for hooking it up to your systems and powered speakers too. It\u2019ll cost \u00a31599 / $1499 / \u20ac1799 when it\u2019s available in the Spring.\nFocal Aria Evo X\nFocal used CES 2024 to introduce the Aria Evo X, the successors to the Aria 900 line released 10 years ago.\nThis is a five-strong range that can work for both traditional stereo and surround sound set-ups. It includes the two-way No.1\u00a0standmount speakers, the three-way No.2, No.3 and No.4\u00a0floorstanders, plus the Evo X centre speaker.\nAs you'd expect, there have been plenty of improvements here that Focal says should offer significant improvements on the range's predecessors. That includes redesigned woofers for a punchier, more impactful bass, while the midrange driver, constructed using Focal\u2019s signature flax cone, now comes fitted with Focal's patented \"Tuned Mass Damper\" technology. Focal says this should deliver better stability to the surround and further reduce distortion.\nThe range offers varying options for different budgets and room sizes, with prices starting from \u00a31299 / $2398 per pair for the compact No.1 speakers, rising to \u00a33999 / $5998 per pair\u202ffor the larger No.4s. The centre channel is available for \u00a3699 / $999.\nThere's a choice of Black High Gloss, Prime Walnut or the new Moss Green High Gloss finish across the range \u2013 we're looking forward to listening to them more closely soon.\nSonus Faber Suprema\nIf you\u2019re looking for the wow factor, the Sonus Faber Suprema system has it in spades. And not least when it comes to its price tag.\nDescribed as its \u201cmost ambitious project to date\u201d, the Suprema system is a four column system made up of two huge 4/5-way speakers and two subwoofers, plus an external electronic crossover.\nThe speakers feature eight front-firing drivers alongside two back-firing ones, and there are three brand new elements at play here \u2013 a new Camila midrange with pulp diaphragm driver, and a new mid-tweeter and super tweeter with treated silk domes.\nThe chamber and its inner walls maintain an organic shape and are made entirely of recycled cork, too, making Sonus Faber the first to use a natural and sustainable material to create acoustic volume.\nThe subwoofer system, on the other hand, uses two 38cm transducers, carbon fibre membranes and a neodymium magnet motor system for undistorted pressures up to 16Hz, while the crossover is a dual mono and fully balanced design.\nAvailable in a choice of red, graphite or walnut finishes, the system will set you back a whopping \u00a3695,000 / $750,000. A suitably indulgent way to celebrate its 40th year, we\u2019d say.\nAudio Pro C20\nAll-in-one speaker systems were a hot item in 2023 and Audio Pro seems to want to keep that trend going in 2024 with its newly unveiled Pro C20.\nThe Audio Pro C20 is a new flagship system from the iconic Scandinavian audio brand. Featuring a premium-looking wooden design, the system immediately caught the eye of our team members on the ground at CES 2024.\nThough we haven\u2019t yet had a chance to listen to it, the C20 has some pretty impressive specs and features considering its \u00a3450 / $550 / \u20ac550 price tag. Featuring two 25mm tweeters and a 16.5cm woofer, the C20 is quoted as being able to deliver 190W of sound, which is impressive considering its small 196 x 410 x 220mm dimensions.\nAdd to this its support for 24-bit/96kHz wireless streaming via Tidal Connect, Spotify Connect, AirPlay 2, Google Cast, Audio Pro Multiroom or Bluetooth, and robust wired connectivity, and it becomes a very compelling product. Hopefully, it delivers on its opening promise when we get it in for testing later this year.\nFiio CP13\nFiiO has a reputation for making swiss army knife products that cram oodles of different functionality into one box. But this year it chose to throw a curve ball at us unveiling a new retro CP-13 cassette player.\nFiiO claims the unit has been designed as a direct homage to Sony's first Walkman player, which launched all the way back in 1979.\nIt doesn\u2019t feature Bluetooth, so it\u2019s firmly designed for playing tapes only, with the only modern flourish being a the inclusion of USB C charging.\nThe CP13 will launch in early March, with a retail price of \u00a3129. And while that may sound steep for such a retro product, it got some of the older members of the What Hi-Fi? team excited enough to start dusting off their old tapes in anticipation and earned the CP13 a place on this list.\nSamsung Music Frame\nSamsung already has The Frame, a line of TVs designed to double as pieces of art, that can display images of your choosing. And, at CES 20204, the Korean giant announced a Frame product with a purely sonic slant.\nThe Music Frame is a wireless speaker that's been designed to be used either as a stand-alone product, or in conjunction with a Samsung soundbar or flatscreen TV. For example, you could use two Music Frame speakers at the front of your system as front left or right channels with your TV.\nOr, you could use them at the rear of your set-up as surround sound channels. They support Samsung\u2019s Q-Symphony technology so you can sync with compatible Samsung soundbars. You can also stream music over Bluetooth or Wi-Fi and use them as traditional wireless speakers dotted around the home.\nMORE:\nCES 2024 news and highlights \u2013 LG and Samsung's groundbreaking TVs, and more\n9 most excitement hi-fi announcements from CES 2024\nHands on: LG G4 review\nGet the What Hi-Fi?
