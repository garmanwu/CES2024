At CES, guests can experience the AMLOS solution inside the Canon booth by joining a hybrid focus group session. By teaming up with the Australian luggage brand, July, CES attendees can participate in a focus group with July\u2019s Luggage Design Team and collaborate with fellow CES guests on the design of a travel-themed product.\nAMLOS is a software-and-camera product suite that works in conjunction with a company\u2019s compatible video conference solution and is designed to support robust collaboration for modern hybrid creative meetings. Guests at CES can act as remote participants in an AMLOS meeting so they can customize their own individual view throughout the meeting based on what is shown by the in-person participants which can allow them to see things such as physical objects in the room clearly. At the CES design experience, this includes items such as luggage handles, materials, fabrics, drawings, and whiteboards. The AMLOS solution, which uses one of two sophisticated Canon PTZ (pan, tilt, zoom) cameras, allows in office participants to use hand gesture controls to initiate certain actions, like capturing whiteboard stills, or spotlighting objects in the room. AMLOS gives remote users flexibility to customize their view of what is shown by the in-person participants, allowing for a unique experience that an individual can optimize based on their viewing preference. The AMLOS solution won a 2023 CES Best of Innovation Award in the Software and Mobile Apps category, marking the first time Canon earned this accolade. Be sure to stop by the Canon booth to experience the AMLOS solution during the onsite focus group with the July Luggage design team.\nJourney Beyond the Destination\nCanon is also proud to announce that the MS-500 SPAD Sensor Camera is a CES 2024 Innovation Award winner.
