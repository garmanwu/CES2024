Hiring an unlicensed plumber could lead to poor quality, added future expenses, and potential code violations. Having a licensed plumber tackle your projects only protects you as a homeowner.\nAs you browse our pro listings, take note of the \u201cAngi Certified\u201d badge. Angi Certified businesses meet our standards for certification which include:\nThe owner, principal, or relevant manager passed a criminal background check\nRequired to have applicable state and local licenses\nMaintain an average star rating of 3.0 or better on our network, if they have at least one review\nPaying to advertise their services\nMeeting any other eligibility criteria required by Angi\nThe average cost to hire a plumber is around $100 an hour but can vary between $45 and $200 an hour depending on the plumber\u2019s experience and the repair that you need. It\u2019s also important to note that these prices can go up on holidays, and emergency plumber rates average $150 per hour, in addition to a flat-rate trip fee of $100 to $350.\nTypically, plumbing repairs cost about $325 per job but can range from $175 to $4,000 or more. Simple fixes, such as a toilet repair, will be less expensive at around $150 to $400. However, if you have a pipe that has burst, you can expect to pay between $1,000 and $4,000 or more.\nThe project that needs to be completed, the size of your home, and the type of plumbing pipes you have can all impact the final cost. External factors such as supply chain issues and shortage of materials all play a part in how much this repair might be.\nBefore finding the right plumber for your job, there are a few questions that you should ask, including:\nAre you licensed and insured?\nDo you charge for estimates?\nIs your fee a flat rate, or is it hourly?\nWho will do the work? Are they all licensed and qualified plumbers?\nWhat happens if any breaks or damages occur?\nWhat is your response time in an emergency?\nIs cleanup included in the quote?\nDo your services come with a guarantee?\nDiscussing these questions with your plumbing contractor will help eliminate future issues and clarify expectations.\nBefore your plumber pays you a visit, it\u2019s a good idea to clean up any boxes, garbage, or other obstacles that could be in their way. In addition, it\u2019s best practice to clean the area that needs to be inspected or worked on, like a toilet, for example.
