Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "The Best of CES 2024\nAmong countless new products and technologies at CES this year, these are the ones that will shape the landscape for the next 12 months and beyond.\nDespite being a ripe 57 years old, CES remains a hotbed of innovation. And like every year, our product experts flocked to Vegas this week alongside more than 130,000 attendees and 4,000 vendors gathered to set the stage for the year in tech ahead. We traveled the halls of the Las Vegas Convention Center and beyond in search of the coolest tech at the show, and we weren\u2019t disappointed.\nWe marveled at everything from futuristic transparent displays and tricked-out electric RVs to concept EVs with 10-minute charging. We dubbed one laptop/tablet hybrid the Double-Stuffed Oreo of computing and saw a keyboard and mouse set that transforms your anxiety into electricity. Technology truly took over Sin City this week, with even the iconic Sphere donning an eye-catching Samsung Galaxy ad.\nIf CES is any indication, 2024 is poised to be the year that AI finally happens. We saw artificial intelligence woven into everything from laptops and TVs to cars, lighting, and even grilling gadgets.\nAs you can see from our list of winners, CES isn't quite as saturated with groundbreaking consumer electronics these days as it was just a few years ago. Now many companies wait to hold their announcements around phones, tablets, smartwatches, and other mobile-focused tech at Mobile World Congress in February. As those categories decline, we're seeing more PCs and components than ever. And let's not forget about all the cars\u2014CES has become its very own must-see show for auto and electric vehicle enthusiasts.\nWith all this in mind, our writers and editors have highlighted 21 standout products, prototypes, and technologies from CES we hope to see readily available in the year ahead. But even if we only get half of them, the future looks bright\u201410,000 nits, to be precise.\nBest Ultraportable Laptop\nDell XPS 14\nWe see iterative updates to the XPS line each year across its various sizes, but few generational jumps are as transformative as this. New 14- and 16-inch sizes have joined the lineup (in addition to the existing 13-inch model), but even that rare occurrence is secondary to the entirely refreshed design. The Dell XPS 14 adopts the styling of the XPS 13 Plus, meaning an invisible seamless touchpad, a flush end-to-end keyboard, and an LED function row. It looks incredibly slick, and on top of that, Intel\u2019s new Core Ultra \u201cMeteor Lake\u201d processors and their onboard neural processing units are powering these systems, ready to tackle local AI tasks.\u2014Matthew Buzzi\nBest Gaming Laptop\nAlienware m16 R2\nWe gave the Alienware m16 four stars last year, and the m16 R2 promises to build on its strengths. Crucially, it will be doing so in a more portable form factor: The entire rear thermal block has been removed and reconfigured to fit inside a 15% smaller chassis. This looks like a great way to achieve a more travel-friendly design while maintaining power. It now tops out an RTX 4070 GPU, but it will deliver no less power in that tier than its predecessor\u2014impressive considering the noticeable trim down\u2014while a dedicated Stealth Mode button will keep your RGB lighting under the radar in public.\u2014MB\nBest 2-in-1 Laptop\nLenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo is doing some interesting things in the two-in-one PC space this year, pushing the concept to the extreme in the Lenovo ThinkBook Gen 5 Hybrid. It's a Windows 11 laptop running on Intel Meteor Lake processors with a display that doubles as an Android tablet. Armed with a Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and its own memory and storage, the tablet separates to become a standalone device, while the bottom half can keep running Windows on an external display, turning the single laptop into two separate devices. But the two can then be used in conjunction with each other, sharing files and even apps when used separately. It's one of the most interesting takes on the dual-device concept we've encountered.\u2014Brian Westover\nBest Gaming Gear\nMSI Claw\nThe MSI Claw has the distinction of being the first handheld gaming PC we've seen running on Intel Meteor Lake hardware. Available with both Core Ultra 5 and Core Ultra 7 processor options, the Claw uses integrated Intel Arc graphics. In addition, it features Hall-effect joysticks, a range of controller buttons in all the usual places, and a pair of programmable macro keys that can be set up for anything from a single keystroke to complex strings of commands. Combine all of this with excellent cooling, a sharp and speedy 7-inch FHD screen, and a purported two-hour battery life while gaming, and it's easily the standout handheld of the show.\u2014BW\nBest Phone\nAsus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition\nNot only does the Asus ROG Phone 8 Pro Edition feature a better camera than previous editions, it's also lighter, thinner and has an IP68 rating so it can be exposed to dust and water. But the real selling points are its tricked-out specs for gaming, including a super-fast processor, a massive 24GB of RAM, 1TB of storage, and an included attachable fan accessory to dissipate heat during long gaming sessions. Its 6.78-inch AMOLED screen is bright and fast, with a 120Hz adaptive refresh rate that can be set up to 165Hz for games, with a high touch sampling rate for fast response when touching on-screen buttons. The phone also comes with a fun rear display that includes 341 programmable mini-LED lights that you can set up yourself or use some of the\u00a0 20 preloaded animations.\u2014Sarah Lord\nBest Smart Home Product\nRoborock S8 MaxV Ultra\nWe saw several promising robot vacuums at CES, and the Roborock S8 MaxV Ultra tops our list not for some crazy new feature or attachment, but by continuing to push the arms race in suction power. Just last year, the S8 Pro Ultra wowed us with 6,000Pa of suction, and then the Ecovacs X2 Omni ended 2023 on top with 8,000Pa. The new S8 MaxV Ultra ups the ante again with 10,000Pa, the most powerful suction we've seen from any robotic floor cleaner. It further pushes the envelope with an optional water line attachment to automatically cycle out the mop\u2019s clean and dirty supply. This high-end hybrid checks every other box as well, with support for self-emptying, automatic mop pad washing and drying, and a camera for video calls. All told, the S8 MaxV Ultra should be a tough model to beat when it launches in April.\u2014Andrew Gebhart\nBest Appliance\nEureka Dual Washing Bot\nThe Eureka Dual Washing Bot is a unique hybrid cleaning appliance that combines an all-in-one laundry machine with a robot floor cleaner. It can both wash and dry your clothes, and vacuum and mop your floors. Using the washer's plumbing connection, the robot vacuum and mop hybrid can automatically empty and refill its internal water tank so it's always ready for the next cleaning run. The robot's base station, which slots underneath the washer's front-load door, can automatically empty the vacuum\u2019s dustbin and wash and dry its mopping pads. If it makes it out of the concept phase, the Dual Washing Bot could be a compelling option for those in need of space-saving appliances.\u2014AG\nBest Health and Fitness Device\nWithings BeamO\nNo time for a doctor's visit or just want to keep your hypochondria in check at home? With a name like a sci-fi gadget from Star Trek, the Withings BeamO is a 4-in-1 \u201cmultiscope\u201d that packs an ECG to assess your heart rhythm, an oximeter to measure your blood oxygen saturation, a stethoscope to capture chest and back acoustic sound waves, and a thermometer to read your body temperature for thorough at-home checkups. You can easily share collected data with your doctor, including sound files recorded with the stethoscope. Yes, you can find most of these sensors on a variety of fitness trackers and smartwatches, but the BeamO makes for a compelling welling gadget that's not beholden to your wrist.\u2014AG\nBest Smart Glasses\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nAR glasses are all the rage at CES, but the XReal Air 2 Ultra stands out a bit more than all the others. It\u2019s a tethered head-mounted display like the XReal Air 2, but with expanded AR capabilities thanks to integrated cameras that map and track what you\u2019re looking at. The Air 2 Ultra lets you control software with your hands and use AR markers (special printed patterns you can set in physical spaces) to determine where projected objects appear and how they work. Even more appealing, they have a massive 52-degree field of view, one of the widest we\u2019ve seen from any AR glasses. They need mobile software that supports the new cameras, though, which is why XReal is mostly promoting the Air 2 Ultra as a tool for developers.\u2014Will Greenwald\nBest AI Device\nRabbit r1\nCalifornia start-up Rabbit is hopping into the market for AI companion devices this year with its r1 handheld. This square device, which is about half the size of a smartphone, relies on simple controls to interact with the company\u2019s Large Action Model. The idea is to create \u201crabbits\u201d\u2014which act similar to applets or scripts\u2014that interact with your apps and perform simple or complex tasks automatically. You can speak or type your commands or queries and even use the camera for object recognition and machine learning. The company says its Rabbit OS is lightweight since it leaves the heavy computing up to the cloud. The r1 supports Bluetooth 5.0, dual-band Wi-Fi, and LTE 4G for cellular connectivity. The Rabbit r1 was designed by Teenage Engineering and backed by Khosla Ventures. The device will go on sale in late March for $199.\u2014Eric Zeman\nBest Prototype\nSony Spatial VR Headset\nThis year\u2019s CES was surprisingly light on VR. This isn\u2019t too surprising, since the Apple Vision Pro is the biggest VR news of the year, and as usual Apple eschewed the show while still dominating chatter by announcing an official launch date for its headset. Still, the most interesting VR headset we saw at CES proper is one that Sony teased during its press conference. Described as a \"spatial content creation system,\" the 4K headset will likely be standalone thanks to the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2+ Gen 2 chips, and it uses a unique pair of controllers consisting of a ring and some sort of finger-wand device. Expected in late 2024, Sony's headset is primarily targeted toward developers and content creators.\u2014WG\nBest Car\nHonda 0 Series EVs\nHonda returned to CES after a four-year hiatus to debut its new line of electric vehicles, the 0 Series. The 0 Series concept EVs have a bold design with a new \u201cH\u201d logo, its first redesign since 1981, which will go on all next-gen Honda EVs. The initial production vehicles for the 0 Series will hit dealers in 2026, with a battery made in Ohio through Honda\u2019s joint venture with LG. The batteries will be lightweight and ultra-thin. The best part? They will be able to fast-charge in 10 to 15 minutes and have 10% degradation or less, but Honda says that will come in the future, not right at the 2026 launch.\u2014Emily Dreibelbis\nBest Headphones\nSennheiser Momentum True Wireless 4\nThough they look similar to their predecessors, Sennheiser\u2019s Momentum True Wireless 4 earphones are a big step up. To start, they have a classy two-tone design that comes in three colors: black copper, graphite, or silver. The matching cases are wrapped in a grippy fabric and support Qi wireless charging in addition to USB-C. As much as we like the exterior, it\u2019s what\u2019s on the inside that counts. Sennheiser says it has reengineered the audio circuitry to boost clarity and sound. Primarily, the company adopted the Qualcomm S5 Sound Gen 2 platform and Snapdragon Sound with aptX Lossless. In addition, the earphones support Bluetooth 5.4 and the burgeoning Auracast technology, which allows you to hear public Bluetooth broadcasts. These upgrades together with improved adaptive active noise cancellation, evolved audio tuning, and longer battery place them among the most promising headphones at the show. They go on sale February 15 for $299.95.\u2014EZ\nRecommended by Our Editors\nBest TV\nHisense 110UX\nAs usual, CES was packed with impressive TVs this year. One of the most important factors we consider when reviewing TVs is picture quality, and that means how much color and light a screen can put out. Previously, the brightest TVs we\u2019ve tested have reached around 2,000 nits. Hisense and TCL announced huge models that shoot past that by factors of 2.5 and 5. The most eye-blasting one is the 110-inch 110UX, which Hisense claims offers 10,000 nits of peak brightness. That\u2019s the top limit of what high dynamic range (HDR) content can be mastered to, and it\u2019s really, really bright. Add 40,000 mini-LED dimming zones and quantum dots and you have the potential for incredible contrast and color.\u2014WG\nBest Monitor\nAlienware 32 4K QD-OLED Gaming Monitor (AW3225QF)\nAlienware\u2019s newest gaming monitor also happens to be one of the best OLED panels of the year. OLED gaming monitors have often skirted around full 4K resolution, opting for QHD resolution (2,560 by 1,440) or going big and wide, like the Samsung Odyssey OLED G9, but the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is the \u201cworld\u2019s first\u201d 32-inch 4K OLED gaming monitor. We already got a chance to test it, and in our review we praise its visuals, its excellent performance, and its fantastic color accuracy and coverage. Gamers will appreciate its 240Hz refresh rate and ultra-low input lag, but its slight curve and myriad of port options makes it a great choice for work and watching movies, too. You son\u2019t have to wait to get your hands on it, as the Alienware AW3225QF 4K QD-OLED is available now for $1,199.\u2014Zackery Cuevas\nBest Projector\nLG CineBeam Qube\nWe've seen plenty of 4K home theater projectors and scores of portable projectors, but the LG CineBeam Qube is a \"lifestyle\" projector that does both. At just 5.3 by 5.3 by 3.1 inches and 3.3 pounds, it can project up to a 120-inch 4K picture with a 450,000:1 contrast ratio and 154% coverage of the DCI-P3 digital cinema color space. It\u2019s notably smaller than Samsung's Premiere 5 projector, at 87 cubic inches to the Premiere 5\u2019s 230. A release date and pricing haven't been announced, but LG has a sign-up page if you want to be kept in the loop on launch promotions.\u2014WG\nBest Printer\nHP Sprocket Photobooth\nA whole new form factor is a rare thing with printers, so we have to laud HP\u2019s clever take on the commercial photo station, rethought for the home. The $449 Sprocket Photobooth lets you take quick pictures at a family gathering, wedding, or other festive occasion using its built-in camera and screen; apply filters and thematic frames on the spot; and immediately print out adorable sticky-backed snapshots onto special paper. The paper stock, using a technology known as Zero Ink (Zink), has an embedded coating that requires no separate ink cartridges to print. Everyone can take home their own personalized pics with the guest of honor.\u2014John A. Burek\nBest CPU\nAMD Ryzen 7 8700G\nThe Ryzen 7 8700G is the best of AMD\u2019s new Ryzen 8000 G-Series processors. In addition to having eight Zen 4 CPU cores, the processor is equipped with a powerful integrated graphics processor based on AMD\u2019s RDNA 3 graphics architecture. This is the same technology used inside of its Ryzen 7000-series graphics cards, and it enables the Ryzen 7 8700G to support what looks tol be some of the fastest integrated graphics performance possible. Though the Radeon graphics on the chip are still no match for a modern graphics card, the ability to build a competent gaming PC for current AAA titles with just the Ryzen 7 8700G is exciting, especially for system builders on a tight budget.\u2014Michael Justin Allen Sexton\nBest GPU\nMSI GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert\nNvidia\u2019s new GeForce RTX 40-series Super cards are exciting new additions to the graphics card market. All offer increased performance over their non-Super counterparts, but the RTX 4080 Super is even more enticing, as it provides this performance boost alongside a significant price cut. At CES, we got a chance to see several different partner-card models of this upcoming GPU, of which MSI\u2019s GeForce RTX 4080 Super 16G Expert stands out. This card practically screams premium with a thermal solution reminiscent of Nvidia\u2019s iconic Founders Edition coolers, with one fan on each side of the card enclosure. The design looks more modern, however, and exudes even higher quality with alluring RGB LED lights, a shiny metal build, and large air vents to expedite cooling of the GPU.\u2014MJAS\nBest Compact Desktop\nAsus ROG NUC\nThe revival of the NUC compact PC line under the ASUS ROG gaming brand is a welcome one. The Asus ROG NUC emerges as the top compact gaming desktop of the show, packing plenty of gaming prowess into a 2.5-liter space. The mini PC features Intel Meteor Lake processors, including the Core Ultra 7 155H and Core Ultra 9 185H, coupled with Nvidia GeForce RTX 4060 and RTX 4070 mobile GPUs. Weighing under 2 pounds, it's a console replacement or living room PC with AAA-game capabilities, on par with premium gaming laptops. The small chassis supports up to 32GB of memory, upgradable storage, and offers a range of ports. With parts and performance similar to gaming laptops, we also expect the pricing to be similar when it launches this spring.\u2014BW\nBest PC DIY Product\nMSI Project Zero\nOnce you\u2019ve tricked out your desktop PC with glass sides, all the RGB fans and mood lighting that\u2019s fit to install, and a splashy liquid cooling system, what\u2019s the next level of cool? Take MSI\u2019s Project Zero, which employs a new family of specially designed, complementary PC cases and motherboards. The boards have all their wire connectors on the reverse side of the PCB. That lets you design a PC with no visible cables (well, if you ignore the graphics card\u2019s power lead) for the ultimate in a clean look inside the chassis. We did a test build with the first Project Zero hardware, which debuted at CES and goes on sale imminently, and found it largely a pain-free path to a spectacular-looking desktop.\u2013JAB\nSee More of the Best From CES 2024\nThe Biggest (and Coolest) TVs at CES 2024\nFrom AI to Wild Displays: The 4 Biggest Trends From CES 2024\nRobot Vacs, Grilling Gear, and AI, Oh My!

        "raw_content": "The best products and ideas at CES 2024 | The DeanBeat\nDo you want to get the latest gaming industry news straight to your inbox? Sign up for our daily and weekly newsletters here.\nThe CES 2023 tech trade show is finally over in Las Vegas, after a grueling six days for me and crowds that numbered perhaps around 130,000.\nI walked around a lot to find the coolest tech. At or ahead of CES 2024, I recorded around 80 press events, interviews, and sessions. I walked 46.78 miles, or 105,407 steps, over six days compared with 38.81 miles (or 87,447 steps) over five days a year ago. My feet hurt and my back is sore.\nI wrote 67 stories ahead of and during CES and I moderated one panel. I recorded 96 sessions, interviews and product descriptions. I have a lot more stories to write. This story is about the coolest tech I saw in Las Vegas. If you had some FOMO from not going to the show, maybe this list will help fill you in on the good stuff at the show. There are 19 products and projects from CES here, as well as updates on products I\u2019ve seen in years past.\nI don\u2019t know about you. But I felt like this was an amazing year for new technology, triggered by refinements in old ideas as well as the gift of generative AI.\nNow it\u2019s time to analyze and make some sense of this. I hope you like these ideas, whether they are concepts or finished products.\nHere\u2019s my list from last year at CES 2023 and the year before at CES 2022.\nThis year featured nearly 3,500 exhibitors, up from 3,000 exhibitors in 2023, and down from 4,000 (in-person) in 2020. Despite occasional warnings from security guards, I dragged my roller bag all over the place. Here are the things that caught my eye.\nSupernal S-A2 eVTOL air taxi\nHyundai\u2019s Supernal showed off its latest design for an air taxi at the CES 2024 tech trade show in Las Vegas this week.\nAir taxis and flying cars have been making a splash at CES for years now, but it\u2019s encouraging to see a big company like Hyundai taking it seriously and moving forward with designs. I thought it was the most interesting thing I saw at CES this year.\nThe Supernal air taxi is an electric vertical takeoff and landing aircraft, or eVTOL. The S-A2 is a second-generation design. South Korea\u2019s Hyundai unveiled its first S-A1 eVTOL program at CES in January 2020.\nThe aircraft will take four passengers. It can cruise at 120 miles per hour, and it has eight rotors that can rotate. It has four in the front of the wing and four in back to balance itself in a vertical takeoff. The engines will be quiet at 45 decibels during flight and 65 during takeoff or landing. That\u2019s as quiet as a dishwasher. It can go from zero to 60 miles per hour during takeoff.\nThis year, the company showed off a VertiPort, or a concept for the places in Los Angeles where you could catch an air taxi. As a division of Hyundai Motor Group, the company is not just developing an aircraft. It\u2019s creating a mobility solution. Neil Marshall, head of manufacturing and program management at Supernal, told me it\u2019s creating a mobility solution. The all-electric air taxi will have a range of 25 miles to 40 miles, with each trip taking just minutes instead of an hour in a car.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new form of taxi, a new form of mobility,\u201d Marshall said.\nThe trips will be short hops to places like downtown Los Angeles or Woodland Hills, long enough to skirt traffic in a 40-minute ride, but likely needing a ride-sharing solution to complete the last mile from the VertiPort to the rider\u2019s final destination.\nRather than make a flying car, Marshall thinks the rideshare car and the air taxi make for a better solution for mobility given the infrastructure that\u2019s already in place. At first, you\u2019ll make reservations for air taxis. But at some point, you\u2019ll just be able to go and catch the flights that are maybe 10 or 20 minutes apart.\nMarshall also showed off the proposed control room where air taxi traffic would be monitored and managed.\nThe air taxis need an air traffic solution, and they have to stay out of commercial air space for airports like LAX. So they will follow the routes of roads, making it easy to stay on course and out of the way of other air taxis. A flight from Universal Studios to Woodland Hills could take 38 minutes, flying over the roads. But it could take more than an hour at peak times in a car.\nSupernal is talking to the FAA and NASA about how to establish the routes properly. The air taxis will have to share the air with devices like drones. Marshall ultimately believes an air traffic control system that is not dependent on human controllers will be the best solution.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about developing an aircraft,\u201d Marshall said. \u201cIt\u2019s about developing a mobility solution. We\u2019re looking at the first mile and the last mile.\u201d\nAir taxis going one way will be able to fly at one elevation and those going another could fly at a different elevation. The elevation will likely be in the 1,500 feet range.\nIt\u2019s not clear how much each ride will cost yet. But Marshall said it could start service as early as 2028.\nClinatec brain-computer interface\nWhen it comes to a brain-computer interface, Elon Musk\u2019s Neuralink isn\u2019t the only show in town. Clinatec also showed off its research at CES Unveiled during CES 2024. The research organization brings together multidisciplinary experts to treat neurological diseases and restore motor functions for those who have had brain or spinal accidents.\nClinatec is a biomedical research center at Polygone Scientifique in Grenoble, France, with biologists, nanontechnology experts and more. Clinatec was developed by the research division of France\u2019s CEA, Inserm and Universite Grenbole Alpes.\nThe biomedical research center in Grenoble, France, has developed a non-invasive brain implant that rests on the surface of the brain and helps restore electrical communication in areas of the brain that have been damaged, said Abdelmadjid Hihi, deputy director for scientific affairs and partnerships at Clinatec, in an interview with me.\nThe cerebral implant records neurological activity and it mimics the signals for making muscles work, said Hihi, who has a doctorate in biological sciences from Lausanne University.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been working on brain implant technology,\u201d said Hihi. \u201cThe concept is that it is possible to use brain activity that corresponds to movement intent to help people who have severe movement impairments.\u201d\nFor instance, someone with a spinal cord injury may not be able to move. Clinatec tries to record brain activity with a system that is bio-compatible and has electrodes which can send signals out of the brain. Those signals are then decoded in real time by machine learning algorithm-based software, Hihi said.\n\u201cAnd then this information was decoded is recorded into machines that can help people walk again or grasp again, or hear again,\u201d he said. \u201cWe basically use this system initially with people who had accidents.\u201d\nHe showed a video of an injured man taking steps with the help of an exoskeleton, and the man is able to do this with signals stimulating both the brain and the muscles. Clinatec has also worked with people who are paraplegics, giving them stimulation for the muscles to make them function.\nThe work has been going on for more than 10 years, and the first patient got an implant more than six years ago. France supports the research through a grant, and in the future Hihi said the group wants to work with those who have had strokes and need rehab.\nThe brain accepts the implant because it consists of bio-compatible materials that are tested before implantation. It doesn\u2019t go inside the brain tissue, but sits on top of it so it reduces inflammation and fibrosis. It makes me think of William Gibson\u2019s sci-fi short story Johnny Mnemonic.\nDexcom Stelo glucose monitor\nBack in 2020, I wore a Dexcom G6 Pro glucose monitor to see what it would be like to have to monitor my blood sugar as if I had diabetes. I am on the border of that condition, but like many millions of Americans I\u2019m at risk if I start to let me weight get out of control. Now Dexcom has something new in the Stelo.\nMy interest came out of being a tech narcissist. I\u2019ve been interested for years in how technology can deliver a \u201cquantified self,\u201d or data about myself and how I live. It measures sleep and steps, but what does it really tell us? In the case of a glucose monitor, it tells you the kind of foods that can send your blood sugar into high or low states. For those with Type 1 diabetes, this is a life-or-death situation requiring frequent insulin injections. They have to make sure their blood sugar stays within an acceptable band or they risk fainting or even death.\nAs I agreed to test the monitor, I realized that I was going to get a glimpse inside my body that most people never get a chance to do. I could look at what I was doing and what I was eating and figure out what the effect was on my blood sugar.\nI was astounded to learn that eating a big pile of spaghetti was one of the things that could push my blood sugar level off the charts and even put me above the 180 milligrams per deciliter threshold that doctors considered to be high.\nIt\u2019s not just the highs that can be bad news. At the same time, when I went for a jog, I found my glucose levels dropped so much that it dipped below 70 milligrams per deciliter and triggered alerts for me, as if I were in danger of fainting. The lows, known as hypoglycemia, can lead to hunger, trembling, heart racing, nausea, and sweating. When I was out of range, I got a notification on my iPhone.\nWhat\u2019s different about the Dexcom Stelo is that it is designed for Type 2 diabetes patients who don\u2019t need to take insulin. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 90% or more of diabetes cases, yet these people don\u2019t always have a clear idea of which foods spike their blood sugar and what to do about it.\nGlucose monitors measure the level of sugar in your blood. For diabetic patients, this is critical.\u00a0Diabetes affects more than 34 million Americans\u00a0and is the seventh leading cause of death in the United States. The traditional standard of care for glucose monitoring has been a fingerstick meter, which is painful as some patients need to test their blood by pricking their fingers up to 12 times a day.\nIn a patient with Type 1 diabetes, the pancreas can\u2019t produce the hormone insulin, which helps the body absorb sugar and remove it from your bloodstream. For Type 2 diabetes patients, their body may not be able to produce or process insulin effectively. Either condition means people have to inject themselves with insulin to take their glucose levels down. But they can only do this if they can accurately measure their blood sugar levels in real time, something that hasn\u2019t been possible or convenient until recently.\nStelo will be a wearable device that sends data to your smartphone and has sensor that can last for 15 days.\nThe pricing will depend on insurance, but the company made the monitor so that it will be affordable for people who don\u2019t have good coverage.\nIt will have a cash pay option for those who don\u2019t have insurance coverage. The good thing is that Moore\u2019s Law is bringing down the cost of these devices.\nStelo is in the midst of getting FDA clearance and it could launch later this year.\nNvidia and Convai show AI characters in a ramen shop\nNvidia and Convai showed off another cool demo with AI characters in the ramen shop. The owner of the shop, Jin, is a non-player character with a realistic-looking avatar that you might find in any video game. In the past, AI showed off a limited demo of this scene. But I was able to do a 20-minute demo where I was able to test the generative AI in just about any way I wanted.\nPreviously, Nvidia and Convai created an amazing demo of the tech with a realistic ramen shop and its characters Jin and Kai. Now Convai showed off the next evolution in AI-driven character technology, which gives characters the ability to hold realistic conversations with players in games. This conversation showed off four different dynamic AI models.\nJin is powered by generative AI, as is his friend Nova, a cybersecurity expert who is a customer in the ramen shop. They were joined by me, playing as the character Kai. I had an open-ended conversation with them. Seth Schneider of Nvidia ACE and Purnendu Mukherjee of Convai guided me.\nIt starts with micro services from Nvidia ACE called ASR, or automatic speech recognition. It takes your voice and turns it into text. Nvidia puts that into a large language model, which can generate the response for the character. Then it has to be piped into a text-to-speech model, and then that has to be fed into a lip-sync program that matches the character\u2019s lip movements to the voice. All of this has to happen in real time, and I only detected a slight delay, perhaps second-long.\nNova and Jin could have talked among themselves and I could have listened in to that conversation as a fly on the wall. But we skipped that part of the demo when it had a hiccup. Jin did say that making ramen was an art. So I just started asking questions.\nThe latest from Convai empowers users to engage NPCs dynamically, seeking real-time responses and actions. Characters now execute complex tasks, fetch items, and initiate interactions with other NPCs. Even during idle moments in the game, Convai-enabled NPCs engage with each other, expanding the spectrum of their interactions and perceptions within the virtual world.\nDesigned to integrate seamlessly with game engines like Unreal Engine and Unity, Convai\u2019s latest iteration redefines the behavior and responsiveness of AI-driven characters within interactive environments.\nThese NPCs now possess enhanced spatial awareness, dynamic character actions, and the ability to engage in meaningful interactions with their environment and other characters. Beyond scripted responses, Convai-powered characters navigate complex instructions, showcase emotional awareness, and participate in organic interactions. It has the potential to reshape the landscape of gaming narratives.\nIn a strategic partnership, Convai integrated Nvidia Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) modules, specifically Nvidia Audio2Face and Riva. This integration enhances the realism, believability, and responsiveness of character interactions.\nNvidia ACE is a suite of technologies leveraging generative AI to bring digital avatars to life. Audio2Face facilitates industry-leading lip sync and facial animations, while Riva delivers high-quality, low-latency speech-to-text capabilities.\nConvai\u2019s technology enables developers to swiftly customize NPC backstories, personalities, and knowledge, granting NPCs the ability to respond uniquely and adapt dynamically. Through an intuitive playground or programmatically via the API, creators witness their characters embody spatial awareness and execute a myriad of actions, offering an unprecedented level of dynamic conversation.\nI asked Nova if she had any interesting cybersecurity cases lately. She asked if I had something interesting. I asked about the hack against Insomniac Games. She said, \u201cI\u2019m not sure but I can look into it if you want.\u201d I wondered if it was all the leaked info was real. She said, \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say but leaks like that usually have at least a grain of truth to them.\nI turned to Jin and asked if he could recommend some ramen. He suggested Shio ramen for something light and miso ramen for something adventurous. I ordered the miso ramen. I asked him how the crime in the neighborhood was. He noted how it\u2019s a rough neighborhood but now he has Nova on his side. But he said we don\u2019t talk about the fear of organized crime.\n\u201cJust enjoy your ramen and let the city do its thing,\u201d he said.\nI asked him about the good luck cat on the wall and he told me how it brought good luck. He also talked the most expensive bottle of sake in the shop. He noted how old man Tanaka told his life story from start to finish in six hours. I asked what was the most interesting part, and Jin said it was when Tanaka claimed he saw a real ghost.\nThere was one moment where I went too far and Jin let me know it. I asked how much money the ramen shop makes in a week, and he said that was private information.\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say the shop does alright and leave it at that,\u201d Jin said.\nConvai had set the aggression level pretty low for Jin, so he didn\u2019t sneer at me with his answer. That was a short conversation, but it was pretty amazing considering it was AI doing the talking.\nAI comes to your laptop\nMicrosoft\u00a0is adding an AI easy button to the Windows keyboard. It\u2019s the first significant change to the Windows PC keyboard in three decades.\nIt\u2019s a sign of the times and a lot of companies announced they would be adding it to their new desktops and laptops coming out this year, making 2024 the \u201cyear of the AI PC.\u201d\nMicrosoft added that the addition will be a big step towards \u201cmaking 2024 the year of the AI PC.\u201d The news comes after Microsoft\u2019s September announcement\u00a0that a new version of Windows 11 would have Microsoft\u2019s AI companion Copilot as part of the operating system. The PCs are coming in late February and through the spring, and they will be on Microsoft\u2019s own Surface devices.\nIntel joined the party by announcing its new Core Ultra processors would have neural processing units, while Advanced Micro Devices said it has already shipped more processors with NPUs on them already. These machines can run machine learning tasks on the local machine, resulting in tasks that are faster, use less battery and are more secure than running them from the cloud.\nHP, Asus, Acer, Lenovo and a bunch of other companies announced PCs with these features. Eventually, the AI on your own machine will become strong enough to perform tasks like analyzing your email inbox and giving you pointers about the people you will be talking to in your upcoming calendar, like the last time you talked to them and what you talked about.\nTransparent OLED TVs from Samsung and LG\nOLED TVs took a new step forward at CES 2024 with transparency. Both Samsung and LG showed off their own versions of the clear TVs.\nSamsung showed its micro-LED display technology which has both brighter and clearer images along with better transparency. This means you can see through the TV to view objects on the other side, such as a window in a skyscraper apartment. You could use it to see through a window-like TV at a private suite in a sports stadium and see both the TV and the action on the field.\nThe LG Signature OLED T is expected to go on sale this year. It is a 77-inch 4K OLED TV with a retractable screen. It\u2019s designed for great ambience, allowing your TV to fade into the background or display an image like a digital fish tank.\nJust an inch thick, it uses wireless Zero Connect, which puts the cables and I/O in a separate box elsewhere. And it has a rolling contrast screen that can turn it into a TV.\nPricing isn\u2019t available yet. The clarity and quality of the TV looked amazing.\nCelestron Origin intelligent home observatory\nCelestron introduced\u00a0the Celstron Origin as a way for telescope fans to turn their home into an intelligent home observatory.\nThis product brings state-of-the-art RASA optics to both novice and seasoned astronomers, enabling effortless exploration of the universe from the comfort of one\u2019s living room, backyard, or campsite. That could make Celestron competitive with Unistellar, which uses AI to filter out light noise in cities so you can look at other galaxies via a telescope in your backyard.\nCelestron said the Celestron Origin incorporates decades of its innovation and expertise, integrating the most sophisticated optical and astronomical technology available today.\nAt its core is a customized version of the Rowe-Ackermann Schmidt Astrograph (RASA) f/2.2 optical system. This system, renowned for its extraordinary wide field of view and ultra-fast telescope technology, has been the preferred choice of professional researchers and government institutions worldwide.\nThe company said what sets Celestron Origin apart is its onboard camera sensor and AI-powered image processing capabilities, which bring celestial objects from deep space to users\u2019 smartphones, tablets, or smart TV/projectors in stunning color and detail within seconds.\nIn addition to its optical performance, Celestron Origin incorporates integrated software, a mobile app, and automated electronics that provide unprecedented convenience and ease-of-use, regardless of the user\u2019s skill level. Previously time-consuming tasks such as sky alignment, focusing, tracking, object identification, and location are now autonomously managed by Celestron Origin\u2019s all-in-one intelligent functionality.\nCelestron Origin offers users a complete star-concierge experience. Users can even schedule deep-space viewing while they sleep by preselecting multiple celestial objects, which are then autonomously captured and saved for later viewing or sharing with family, friends, and fellow astronomy enthusiasts.\nhe observatory\u2019s proprietary app, developed in collaboration with Simulation Curriculum, features a planetarium-style interface that provides educational audio presentations on the selected celestial objects. The app also allows for fully remote operation via smartphone or tablet, including the option to mirror the screen on a smart TV for indoor viewing comfort.\nThe Celestron Origin is the culmination of more than a decade of development, the company said.\nI would also give an honorable mention to Unistellar, which came out with its smaller Odyssey telescope at CES 2024. Its previous announcements spurred a competitive response from Celestron, a much bigger company. Unistellar\u00a0is also extending its pursuit of backyard astronomers with the launch of a new generation of its AI telescopes dubbed the Odyssey Smart Telescope.\nThe promise is to bring the cosmos closer than ever before through a transformative stargazing experience for both seasoned astronomers and enthusiastic novices on a cosmic journey from the comfort of their homes, even amidst urban landscapes, the company said.\nWithings BeamO health multiscope\nDigital health company\u00a0Withings\u00a0announced its\u00a0BeamO\u00a0\u201cmultiscope,\u201d a device that can perform four health checks in under a minute.\nThe Beamo fuses the capabilities of thermometer, electrocardiogram, oximeter and stethoscope in an at-home checkup device. In other words, the multiscope can do more than a fitness watch and leapfrog other single-purpose devices.\nThe aim is to let people do more tests at home and talk to doctors in remote calls about the results, advancing the efficiency of telemedicine.\nTypically, temperature is the only health scan performed regularly at home, Withings said. BeamO is positioned to become the new thermometer of the future in every home and observe heart and lung health at the same time, the company hopes.\nWe don\u2019t have our Star Trek Tricorder yet, but we\u2019re getting there. Last year, Withings made headlines at CES 2023 with its\u00a0urinalysis tool\u00a0based on toilet readings.\nThis advanced \u201cmultiscope\u201d will place the ability to measure core health vitals taken during physician visits into the palm of the hand and will become available in the United States following FDA clearance, Withings said.\nFor the first time, BeamO will combine ECG, oximeter, stethoscope, and thermometer sensors to turn the humble thermometer into a powerful tool for regular monitoring of heart and lung health. Portable and smaller than a smartphone, it is designed to help individuals and families perform at-home checkups and to substantially improve the quality of telehealth visits.\nBeamO is packed with sensors that beam light waves to interpret blood flow patterns and temperature, as well as acoustic information. It performs multiple functions in one handheld device.\nPhotoplethysmography (PPG) and electrodes along its sides allow BeamO to perform blood oxygenation (SpO2) and heart rate readings simultaneously while also conducting a medical-grade 1-lead ECG. A simple light grip of BeamO initiates measurements that can be viewed by users in real-time on its animated colored LED display.\nBeamO conducts accurate and stable core body temperature readings with a noninvasive scan of the temporal artery. An advancement on the Withings Thermo sensor technology, the second-generation hotspot sensor is a mono-element thermophile that narrows the focal area of the infrared beam for contactless measurements. This increases the sensitivity of the scan, making it more robust to changes in distance from the skin or movement.\nA cutting-edge digital stethoscope, BeamO captures chest or back acoustic sound waves through a Piezoelectric disc. With intuitive tutorials, users achieve precise heart and lung measurements. Equipped with a USB-C to jack adapter, results can be heard through headphones and seamlessly transferred, stored, and shared in the app. During telehealth sessions, audio streaming enables physicians to guide device placement and focus on specific areas of interest.\nBeamO will retail at $250 in June 2024, following FDA clearance of its ECG capability. It\u2019s a high price for a glorified thermometero. But Withings notes BeamO will conduct a 4-in-1 health checkup of body temperature, heart, and lung health in under a minute.\nL\u2019Oreal AirLight Pro hair dryer\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Groupe\u00a0unveiled AirLight Pro, a sustainable hair dryer that can adjust to the type of hair it\u2019s drying.\nThe product is backed by 150 patents \u2014 not bad for a non-tech company that is 115 years old. But that\u2019s the nature of technology\u2019s broad reach these days, where non-tech companies are leading with technology products and the tech itself fades into the woodwork.\nAirLight Pro, developed in collaboration with Zuvi, a hardware startup founded by experts in drone engineering and science, boasts a blend of infrared-light technology and high-speed wind to revolutionize hair drying. The tool promises visually smoother and more hydrated hair while consuming up to 31% less energy across various hair types.\nThe brainchild of a partnership between L\u2019Or\u00e9al\u2019s haircare expertise and Zuvi\u2019s technological prowess, AirLight Pro incorporates Zuvi\u2019s patented LightCare technology, utilizing infrared light and high-speed wind to efficiently dry hair while preserving internal moisture. AirLight Pro will be available in 2024 and will cost under $400.\nUnlike conventional heating hair dryers with only heating coils, AirLight Pro is equipped with a special 17-blade, high-speed motor and patented infrared technology powered by tungsten\u2013halogen bulbs designed for fast hair drying without excessive heat. By efficiently drying water on the hair surface, hair isleft with internal moisture in the strand resulting in smooth, shiny hair.\nAirLight Pro not only promises up to 33% more hydrated and 59% smoother hair but also features faster drying times and an enhanced user experience. It was built by a team of more than 100 engineers.\nThe Sphere\nIt\u2019s not on sale unless you\u2019ve got more than $1 billion. But The Sphere is an amazing technological achievement that was on display all the time during CES 2024.\nI was able to see Postcard from Earth in a group suite with Ansys. Sure, it wasn\u2019t U2. But the 2023 film about life on Earth and our climate risks was amazing. It was directed by Darren Aronofsky, and it was designed and shot for the 16K resolution video screen of The Sphere.\nIt\u2019s a 4D film with 270 degrees of viewing experience. It includes haptic seats that rumble with a stampede, scents and wind that blows at you as if it were coming from the screen. The Sphere\u2019s wind effects units can technically achieve blasts of up to 140 mph.\u00a0Spatial audio comes from 168,000 speakers.\nThe Sphere has 1.2 million LED lights on the exterior that you can see from miles away, and it\u2019s the largest such building in the world. The venue seats 17,385 people. We\u2019ll see if The Sphere keeps generating attendees. The advertising on the exterior alone is probably generating a ton of revenue.\nInside, the 160,000 square feet screen is the largest screen in the world. The giant LED screen wraps over and behind the audience, delivering a totally immersive visual environment.\u00a0While the film isn\u2019t that interactive, I imagine there will be more of that in the future. For now, it\u2019s a place where you can see back and relax and be mesmerized.\nPivotal\u2019s Helix light eVTOL aircraft\nKristina Menton, COO of Pivotal, showed off the Helix, a light electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft that has been in the making for 12 years.\nWhen I saw a video of her flying the aircraft, I asked Menton if she was crazy. She said she was a trained pilot with a lot of hours in the aircraft, which is the first Pivotal aircraft that will be made at scale.\nWeighing in at just 348 pounds empty, the Helix is classified as an ultralight aircraft. It doesn\u2019t require a pilot\u2019s license to be flown, but it is prohibited in urban areas and can only be flown in rural areas. It costs $190,000 and up.\nIt runs on electric power, and it has a 20-minute or 20-mile range, with 20% reserved for safety purposes. It has digital instruments and simple controls. While Helix does not require a pilot\u2019s license for ownership, it does require a lot of training.\nIt can take off vertically and land the same way, but it flies like a plane with its fixed rotors, tandem wings and tilt aircraft. It\u2019s a single-seat aircraft with no passengers allowed, per requirements of Part 103 Ultralight regulations in the U.S. It has amphibious capability restricted to emergency landings. It\u2019s only 13 feet and 7 inches long, 5 feet and 3 inches high, and 13 feet and 5 inches long.\nThe wingspan is 33.13 feet. It can bear a load of up to 220 pounds and someone no taller than 6 feet 5 inches. It can fly at 55 knots, or 63 miles per hour. The aircraft is made from carbon fiber. It has a triple redundant flight control system, eight rotors with six required for flight and landing, and split elevons that tolerate servo failure.\nClicks case brings back the physical keyboard to smartphones\nClicks Technology\u00a0is bringing back the days of physical keyboards for iPhones. The company showed off its Clicks keyboard/case that will make you nostalgic for the good old Blackberry.\nThis accessory is a case and keyboard built in one, working with either the Lightning or USB-C connector (which is used on the newer iPhones like the iPhone 15). The company showed it at the\u00a0CES 2024\u00a0show and folks were lined up to check it out at the party where I saw it.\nIt\u2019s based on the belief that a tactile keyboard gives content creators and users a better experience reminiscent of older devices like the BlackBerry, known for its physical QWERTY keyboard. The keyboard has a soft touch and the case has a solid grip. You can turn on a backlight with a button push.\nWith a full set of real buttons, Clicks offers iPhone users an alternative to the virtual keyboard, liberating valuable screen space and empowering users to multitask more efficiently. Scheduled for availability starting February 1, the Clicks keyboard is available for pre-order at a pricey $139.\nIt comes from Michael Fisher, cofounder of Clicks Technology. Fisher is a YouTube tech reviewer known as MrMobile with 1.2 million subscribers, and Kevin Michaluk (known as CrackBerry Kevin), alongside a team of experts with mobile experience from companies like Apple, BlackBerry, and Google.\nThe Clicks creator keyboard enhances the iPhone experience with screen real estate. By removing the keyboard from the display, Clicks maximizes the screen, doubling the available space for content immersion.\nIt offers a more natural typing experience for people on the move. Clicks facilitates mobile creation tasks like writing notes, editing documents, or prompt action on ideas. And it introduces iOS keyboard shortcuts to iPhone users for improved navigation and task handling.\nUtilizing the Lightning or USB-C connection means that Clicks requires no separate battery or Bluetooth connection.\nThe Clicks Founders Edition, available in BumbleBee and London Sky colors, offers exclusive benefits including VIP support and early access to future releases.\nMuscle Suit Every gives you an exoskeleton\u2019s strength\nThe Muscle Suit Every from Japan\u2019s Innophys makes everything feel lighter. The exoskeleton is pretty low tech, but it lightens the load on your back, and it assists you with basic everyday motions like picking things up.\nThe suit weighs 8.3 pounds. The exoskeleton assists your movements with up to 25.5 kgf of auxiliary force. The Innophys rep told me that\u2019s like lifting 25 pounds and feeling like you\u2019re lifting five pounds. I tried it out and they helped me put it on in seconds. When I bent down, I could feel the suit deliver force to my hamstrings, making it easy to come back up. I saw a woman pick up a big man with the suit.\nThe artificial muscle uses air pressure. You pump it up when you want more strength. It adjusts to the movement of every person wearing it. It needs no electricity, as the manual pump comes with it.\nThe Muscle Suit uses a McKibben-type artificial muscle as its driving force. The rubber tube is encased in a mesh made from polyester monofilament and both ends are secured with metal in this simple configuration.\nThe Muscle Suit is made up of a back frame and thigh frame, and a rotation axis that connects the two. The upper end of the artificial muscle is affixed to the upper portion of the back frame, and the connected wire is affixed to the rotation axis at the lower end. With the compression of the artificial muscle, the wire is pulled and the back frame rotates around the rotation axis. As the thigh frame, which is affixed to the rotation axis, rotates in the opposite direction, the upper body is held upright using the thighs as the fulcrum.\nDoublepoint lets you control things via finger gestures\nFinland\u2019s Doublepoint Technologies launched a gesture-tech app on Google Play that shows off its gesture-touch technology for Android wearables such as watches.\nYou can do things like pinch at a virtual object with your fingers and the Android watch will detect your wrist movements and convey to the smartphone or computer that you\u2019re pinching your fingers. The company said it can very accurately detect such \u201cmicrogestures\u201d and do so much more cheaply than cameras, which are used in devices such as virtual reality headsets.\nThe app introduces the brand-new gesture-touch technology, coupled with instant Bluetooth connectivity to a myriad of devices, marking a leap in human-computer interaction, the company said.\nThe Finnish startup has released a version of its gesture detection algorithm, now compatible with WearOS smartwatches, aiming to elevate user experiences beyond traditional touch interfaces. You control things via a Bluetooth connection to the watch.\nRazer\u2019s Project Esther gaming chair cushion\nRazer showed off its new Sensa HD Haptics technology with a concept dubbed Project Esther. The company embedded the force-feedback tech in gaming chair cushion.\nI tried it out by playing a mech combat game where I had to shoot four different kinds of weapons at a bunch of enemies attacking my base. It was a frenzied scene where I could feel the haptics of explosions in my seat. But the rumble also came in through the game controller I was holding as well as the headphones that I was wearing. You could ratchet up or down the experiences. One of the coolest experiences was hearing and feeling the THX sound logo.\nProject Esther isn\u2019t available just yet. But it\u2019s pretty interesting how haptics is moving in new directions. Now all they need is a fan to blow wind and rain at you.\nStern Pinball\u2019s Jaws\nStern Pinball\u00a0said its latest line of pinball games inspired by one of cinema\u2019s most gripping motion picture thrillers \u2013 Jaws, from Universal Pictures and Amblin Entertainment.\nPlayers can now immerse themselves in the iconic trilogy with cool pinball technology and mechanical features that bring the film\u2019s best moments to life. The Jaws pinball games come in pro, premium, and limited edition (LE) models, providing enthusiasts with various options to dive into the game\u2019s narrative.\nThe Jaws-themed pinball games transport players to the picturesque yet perilous setting of Amity Island, off the coast of Long Island, New York. As the beloved fishing community gears up for Fourth of July celebrations, danger lurks beneath the surface as shark attacks threaten the island\u2019s peace.\nMirroring the film\u2019s intense storyline, players step into the shoes of Quint, the grizzled fisherman, tasked with combating the ominous ocean creatures. The gameplay features aiming pinballs at a motorized shark fin target, accompanied by animated lighting effects, while navigating through the Orca Boat upper playfield.\nI played two rounds and did pretty good. But it was hard getting time at the machines with so many people gathered around it.\nVarjo X4 headset can transport you to other places\nVarjo released its \u201cgaze-directed\u201d XR-4 Series mixed reality headset today for $3,990, or half the price of its previous enterprise VR headsets.\nVarjo\u2018s goal is to deliver mixed reality experiences that are indistinguishable from natural sight. The Helsinki, Finland-based company has made multiple generations of high-end VR and AR \u2014 mixed reality \u2014 headsets since 2016. I finally got a good look at it in a suite where I could see the fidelity of its 4K per eye displays.\nI put the headset on and it felt lighter, given the engineering to balance the headset on your head. I was transported to a scene in an artist\u2019s room. And it was pretty amazing how real it looked. It was a static scene in three dimensions, but everywhere I looked it felt like I was in another place that was real. I could also see someone else\u2019s outline if they came to close to me in the room. Things blurred when I moved.\nIt has added gaze-directed, high-resolution autofocus cameras in mixed reality with the XR-4 Series, which comes in either a Focal Edition or a Secure Edition.\nThrough the fusion of its highest-resolution displays, foveated capture stream, advanced LiDAR depth sensing and camera sensors, all of which mimic the function of the human eye, the Varjo XR-4 series offers virtual and mixed reality experiences that go beyond consumer-grade headsets by far, the company said.\nVarjo said rival headsets cater to 2D productivity use cases. But Varjo\u2019s 4th generation headsets are designed to deliver deeply immersive VR/XR experiences for industrial customers who require top visual fidelity and performance. The previous headsets came out in 2020.\nToday, over 25% of Fortune 100 companies are using Varjo\u2019s technology to train astronauts and pilots, radically shorten automotive production timelines, power medical breakthroughs, and render stunning 3D visualizations for architects and designers.\nPowered by Nvidia graphics processing units (GPUs) and integrated into the Nvidia Omniverse, the XR-4 series allows developers and industrial users to render photorealistic scenes and unlock ray tracing in mixed reality.\nThe combined technologies dwarf the computational power that can be achieved with a mobile chip and are a game-changer for developers, Varjo said.\nThis headset has a 50% larger field of view than the previous headset, with a 120-degree viewing angle. It can produce 28 million pixels across both eyes.\nThe headset has dual 4K x 4K displays with a resolution of 51 pixels per degree (ppd) and over 50% wider field of view (120\u00b0 x 105\u00b0) compared to previous-generation devices, with double the display brightness (200 nits) and wider color gamut with 96% DCI-P3.\nIt also has dual 20 Mpx cameras for powering the industry\u2019s highest-fidelity, real-time photorealistic video pass-through mixed reality. And it has new ambient light sensors and 8 x improved LiDAR resolution compared to Varjo XR-3 that seamlessly blends real and virtual elements.\nGoodyear\u2019s demo of tire intelligence\nGoodyear announced that it has built tire intelligence into its tires with the help of tech-focused partners.\nI spoke about these developments with Chris Helsel, senior vice president of global operations and CTO at Goodyear, in an interview. Tire intelligence means getting data on the actual state of wear of a tire and making predictions about how long that tire will last or how it will perform in emergency conditions.\nThis is about getting real world information about the state of your tires and using that information for everything from scheduling replacement, getting maintenance or avoiding crashes. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is talking about this at its first booth appearance at\u00a0CES 2024 for the first time in its 126-year history. And it\u2019s why Goodyear brought its world-famous Goodyear Blimp to the show. I was lucky enough to get a ride in it.\nBut the coolest tech was down on the show floor, where I was able to get in a simulator. It showed me the stopping distance that I would have if the car used knowledge of the state of the tires along with other information coming from the car\u2019s sensors. The first time I went driving in the rain, I found I couldn\u2019t stop fast enough at a stop sign and I ran right into a deer. Fortunately, that part wasn\u2019t animated.\nThe second and third times, I was able to stop well ahead of the stop sign with the added capability turned on. I was also able to do demos that showed the tire handling in driving between cones, when I had different tires on the car at different times. And I was able to experience what hydroplaning was like \u2014 spinning out on a wet onramp \u2014 without fearing for my life.\nTranslation apps\nMymanu came back with live voice translation earbuds which can translate spoken words into your ears via earbuds or to a handheld device via text.\nThe day when you can\u2019t get by without a translator may be gone soon.\nThere were a lot of translators at CES. Another was the Vasco Translator E1, which goes on sale in June for $390. It can translate 50 languages in real time while connected to an app on your smartphone.\nVasco added translations from linguists who can address idioms when a literal translation will be wrong.\nThe translated text is visible in the app and spoken to your through your earphone. I haven\u2019t tried all of these out, but they all seem pretty space age to me.\nHonorable mentions\nHonorable mentions include the GE Smart Indoor Smoker, which lets you smoke meats and more inside your home; the $700 Xreal Air 2 Ultra augmented reality glasses that will give the $3,500 Apple Vision Pro a run for its money; the Samsung Ballie, which is a bowling ball robot that rolls around your home and answers questions for you and projects images on a wall; and the Rabbit R1 which is a $200 AI gadget that serves as an assistant for you.\nExcellent things that were back for another year\nSkyted\u2019s silent mask\nSkyted showed off a silent privacy mask that makes you look like Bane. It\u2019s the kind of mask that fighter pilots wear to keep all the noise of the jet engine away from their microphone as they speak into the jet\u2019s radio.\nThe mask is pretty tight, but it is not rated for HEPA or keeping out unhealthy germs. Rather, it\u2019s a privacy filter that is soundproof. When you speak into it, no one else can hear you. So you can take a private business call in a busy area, and you don\u2019t have to worry about being overheard.\nYou could talk in a library or even on a crowded airplane.\nThe Pimax Crystal\nI stopped by Pimax\u2018s booth at the Las Vegas Convention Center and saw some pretty good demos of games running on simulation rigs.\nThe people using the rigs wore Pimax Crystal headsets, which deliver an ultra-realistic virtual reality experience. At the show, Pimax was showing off the 60G AirLink, utilizing cutting-edge 60G millimeter wave(mmWave) technology.\nIt enables high-speed wireless data transmission and low latency, pivotal for video streaming and immersive VR experiences. It has good bandwidth and anti-interference features. Pimax showed off its 12K-EVT\u03b8 prototype with a wide field of view. Pimax also showed off a flight simulator and a racing simulator with players wearing the VR headset.\nMilo Action Communicator\nLoose Cannon Systems\u00a0was back with its\u00a0Milo\u00a0wearable action communicators as reimagined walkie-talkies for outdoor adventurers.\nYou can use them to speak with groups of friends and family while you ride, surf, ski and more. The Milo communicator is hands-free, phone-free, and requires no Wi-Fi or cell signal. It also has some cool AI technology built into it. Now it can verify who is in your group and easily add or delete people.\nThe latest model has more functions for folks who need to keep track of each other for social and safety reasons while out in the wild.\nHyundai Mobis Mobion\nThe\u00a0Hyundai Mobis Mobion enables cars to move diagonally, sideways, or even spin around in circles. It uses a new steering technology with advanced robotics that allow the vehicle to maneuver into different positions that you can run into when trying to get through crowds or parking a vehicle in a tight spot.\nHyundai hopes to be taking the tech to market in 2025. The wheels can move independently and more as you can see in the demo.\nHover Air X1 self-flying selfie drone\nThe HoverAir X1 is an easy-to-use self-flying selfie drone that sells for $350. It only weighs 4.4 ounces, and it sports a 2.7K selfie camera mounted in a drone with high-speed fans.\nI\u2019ve tested one of these and it is easy to use. You simply sync it to the app on the smartphone via Bluetooth. Then you turn it on, hold it flat in your hand, and then launch it via the app. It takes off and runs a pattern, like hovering by you, and it snaps a picture. It can also go high in the air, orbit around you, or follow you and take pictures.\nIt tracks you and captures you in cinematic moments from angles where you can\u2019t easily do it yourself.\nWacky AI item\nAI was all over the show, of course. But the winner of my wacky AI award goes to the AI Backpack from Happysites. The Happysites LED backpacks let you create your own light shows on the back of your backpack. But if you aren\u2019t feeling too creative, the company will let you use generative AI to help you make your own image or clip.\nGamesBeat's creed when covering the game industry is \"where passion meets business.\" What does this mean?

CES (previously Consumer Electronics Show) has been held in Las Vegas every year since 1978, except for 2021 due to COVID-19. This was my ninth CES representing Semiconductor Intelligence, with the first in 2012. CES is put on by the Consumer Technology Association (CTA). CTA is 100 years old, beginning in 1924 as the Radio Manufacturers Association. Through the years the name has been changed to Radio-Television Manufacturers Association (1950), Radio-Electronics-Television Manufacturers Association (1953), Electronics Industry Association (1957), Consumer Electronics Association (1997) and the Consumer Technology Association (2015).\nA major theme of CES 2024 is AI (artificial intelligence). The CTA Tech Trends session revealed the results of a U.S. consumer survey on AI. The positives were over a third of respondents characterized AI as being innovative and futuristic. However, most respondents were extremely or very concerned about:\nAlso, 74% of the respondents believed the U.S. government should regulate AI safety.\nThe significance of AI at CES 2024 is reflected by the number of exhibitors classifying under AI and related categories. Note that companies can be classified under more than one category.\nThe Las Vegas Convention Center (LVCC) was the primary space for CES 2024. The largest area was devoted to Vehicle Tech & Advanced Mobility, which occupied the entire 600 thousand square feet of the West Hall and about another 100 thousand square feet in the North Hall. The companies exhibiting included auto manufacturers (Hyundai, Kia, Mercedes-Benz, and Honda), farm and construction equipment companies (John Deere, Caterpillar, and HDHyundai) and numerous companies supplying components and systems for vehicles. Qualcomm had a large booth pushing its automotive technology.\nMost of the North Hall featured the categories of Digital Health, Smart Cities & IoT Sustainability, IoT Infrastructure, and AI/Robotics. The Central Hall featured Audio Video and Gaming. The largest booths in the Central Hall were from Sony, LG Electronics, Samsung Electronics, Panasonic, and TCL Corporation.\nThe AI theme dominated the major electronics companies press conferences and booths. The theme of Samsung\u2019s press conference was \u201cAI for All\u201d. Samsung sells over 500 million smart devices each year. The emphasis was on tying smart devices together and security. Samsung pushed its televisions as a digital hub for the smart home. It introduced a new line of TVs based on the Samsung NQ8 AI Gen3 processor. Other products introduced included a new version of its Ballie AI robot, new Galaxy Book 4 notebooks, smart refrigerators, and automotive heads-up displays. Interestingly, there was not mention of smartphones, Samsung\u2019s largest sales category.\nThe numerous products featured at CES 2024 are featured on many media platforms, so I will not try to cover them here. However, there were a few products I found intriguing.\nOorion has an intelligent radar for the visually impaired which will identify and locate objects. It is available as a free app.\nDeRUCCI introduced its T11 Pro smart mattress. It uses sensors and air bags to adjust for optimal sleep.\nShooter Detection Systems featured an indoor gunshot detector with acoustic and infrared sensors to identify shots fired within a building and send an alert to building security and police departments.\nCaterpillar introduced an electric mining machine to eliminate exhaust emissions in mines.\nOlympian Motors showcased its electric cars with retro styling. Its instrument panel uses old fashioned gauges rather than display screens.\nWIRobotics demonstrated its WIM wearable mobility device to assist with walking and load carrying.\nNumerous robots were on display at CES 2024. Some of the more interesting robots are:\nCHIPS Act and U.S. Fabs\nSemiconductors Headed Toward Strong 2024\nElectronics Production Trending Up\nTurnaround in Semiconductor Market\nComments\nThere are no comments yet.\nYou must register or log in to view/post comments.\nPost navigation\nSponsor\nSemiconductor Intelligence Company Wiki\nMost Viewed Blog 2023\nMost Viewed Blog 2022\nMost Viewed Blog 2021\nMost Viewed Blog 2020\nMost Viewed Blog 2019\nMost Viewed Blog 2018\nMost Viewed Blog 2017\nMost Viewed Blog 2016\nMost Viewed Blog 2015\nMost Viewed Blog 2014\nMost Viewed Blog 2013\nMost Viewed Blog 2012\nMost Viewed Blog 2011\nGoogle Translate\nRecent Forum Threads\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger on achieving chip independence: Goal is 50/50 by the end of the decade\nTSMC 2024 Investor Meeting Discussion\nTSMC's Risky Bet Could Be Great News for Intel Investors\nSamsung, SK to spend $471 billion on 'world's largest chip cluster'\nGartner Says Worldwide Semiconductor Revenue Declined 11% in 2023\n70% of European automobile components traverse Red Sea\nSynopsys (SNPS) Surges 3.1%: Is This an Indication of Further Gains?\nTSMC's 2nm progress is smooth, supply chain is picking up orders ahead of schedule\nDealing with the threat AI/ML has on the job market\nNvidia inks order for 16,000 AI GPUs worth $500 million \u2014 Indian data center company seeks to own 32,000 Nvidia H100 and GH200 GPUs by 2025\nSponsor\nSemiconductor Intelligence Company Wiki\nMost Viewed Blog 2023\nMost Viewed Blog 2022\nMost Viewed Blog 2021\nMost Viewed Blog 2020\nMost Viewed Blog 2019\nMost Viewed Blog 2018\nMost Viewed Blog 2017\nMost Viewed Blog 2016\nMost Viewed Blog 2015\nMost Viewed Blog 2014\nMost Viewed Blog 2013\nMost Viewed Blog 2012\nMost Viewed Blog 2011\nRecent Forum Threads\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger on achieving chip independence: Goal is 50/50 by the end of the decade\nTSMC 2024 Investor Meeting Discussion\nTSMC's Risky Bet Could Be Great News for Intel Investors\nSamsung, SK to spend $471 billion on 'world's largest chip cluster'\nGartner Says Worldwide Semiconductor Revenue Declined 11% in 2023\n70% of European automobile components traverse Red Sea\nSynopsys (SNPS) Surges 3.1%: Is This an Indication of Further Gains?\nTSMC's 2nm progress is smooth, supply chain is picking up orders ahead of schedule\nDealing with the threat AI/ML has on the job market\nNvidia inks order for 16,000 AI GPUs worth $500 million \u2014 Indian data center company seeks to own 32,000 Nvidia H100 and GH200 GPUs by 2025"
