Here\u2019s how it works.\nFujifilm rumors predict its 2024 camera lineup \u2013 here\u2019s what we\u2019re expecting to see\nWill we finally see an X100V successor in 2024?\nFrom likely announcements to the wildly speculative, Fujirumors has shared the Fujifilm mirrorless cameras that we could see in 2024, including the hotly anticipated upgrade to the hugely popular Fujifilm X100V, and an entirely new-concept medium-format model.\nThe camera that could become another Tiktok trend is the potential X100V successor, and according to Fujrumors a sixth iteration is on the horizon. Elsewhere, rumors had pointed to an all-new high-speed medium-format camera that\u2019ll be the fastest of its kind, but it now appears that cold water is being poured on those rumors.\nFujifilm had a decent 2023, with the X-S20 and GFX100 II being standout new models from any of the leading camera brands. And next year could be even more fruitful, especially in terms of the number of new models. Let\u2019s run through the 2024 contenders.\n1. The long-awaited Fujfilm X100V successor\nWe have to start with the possible successor to one of the most popular cameras in 2023, the X100V. We don\u2019t know for sure the name of the sixth iteration in the popular series of APS-C sensor fixed-lens compact cameras, although \u2018X100R\u2019 is what we\u2019re seeing the most often.\nGiven that the X100V is still out of stock at most retailers, your best chance of getting the latest and greatest Fujifilm tech in the coveted X100 series may be to bag what could become the best compact camera around, the so-called X100R.\nWhat will the X100R bring to the table? We\u2019ve compiled the most reliable X100R rumors, but highlights include the same 40MP APS-C sensor as in the X-T5 and X-H2, the latest X-processor 5, improved battery life, plus in-body image stabilization; we\u2019d be surprised if there\u2019s any change to the trusty 23mm f/2 fixed lens.\nAccording to rumors, we shouldn\u2019t have to wait long either \u2013 the potential release date is the first quarter of 2024, while the list price could be around $1,599 / \u00a31,499 / AU$2,649.\n2. Fujifilm GFX100S II\nAccording to Fujirumors, a new medium-format model could be released at the same time, or around the same time, as the X100R \u2013 potentially the first quarter of 2024 \u2013 and that model will be the GFX100S II. If all four cameras in this article materialize, then arguably this would be the least compelling of the bunch, most likely a minor update of the GFX100S that borrows some of Fujifilm\u2019s latest tech from the GFX100 II, which earned five stars in our Fujifilm GFX100 II review.\nIt\u2019ll be more affordable than the GFX100 II, with pared-down video features. It could have the same updated 100MP sensor as Fujifilm\u2019s flagship model, but slightly less power under the hood, a stripped-back body design, and \u2013 what could really give it extra appeal for old-school fans \u2013 retro dials. It might not offer anything new, but this could still become one of the best professional cameras with a medium-format sensor.\n3. Fujifilm X-Pro 4\nAccording to New Camera, the X-Pro 4 is a highly likely candidate for 2024, although the rumored specification of this latest model is mere speculation that has barely changed from year-old rumors.\nIt would replace the three-year-old X-Pro 3, a polarizing camera that breaks from the norm, with a 1.62m-dot tilt screen that can fold away to reveal a smaller LCD on its reverse that simply displays what Film Simulation is in use \u2013 much like a film roll in an analog SLR camera (see above). Of any X-series camera design, Fujifilm has the greatest license to appease analog fans with the potential X-Pro 4.\nBesides a familiar design that also includes the hybrid viewfinder, the X-Pro 4 could have the 40MP sensor like in the X-T5, seven stops of in-body image stabilization, improved autofocus and 4K 60p video.\u00a0Is there sufficient demand for another X-Pro model? We hope so.\n4. The fastest ever digital medium-format camera\nThe most intriguing of the four rumored cameras is a high-speed medium-format camera, a \u2018GFX25\u2019. Fujifilm\u2019s nomenclature for this sensor format indicates how many pixels the sensor has, as with the 50MP GFX50S II and the 100MP GFX100 II. We can therefore discern that a GFX25 would have 25MP.\nProvided there\u2019s the same power under the hood, fewer pixels would in theory enable superior burst-shooting speeds, with 12fps being rumored, plus better high-ISO performance, and excellent video quality up to 6K video (that\u2019s the maximum resolution for video from a 25MP sensor).\nThis could be the fastest medium-format camera ever, surpassing the impressive performance of the GFX100 II, as well as being one that's more video focused \u2013 much like the Sony a7S III series. Do people considering this large sensor format think about high-speed photography or video? We\u2019re not sure, and the most recent update from Fujirumors pours cold water over this intriguing concept being circulated from other rumor sites. Interesting as this one sounds, it\u2019s firmly in the 'not likely' column.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nTim is the Cameras editor at TechRadar.

The show is in full swing now, with the show floor officially open. Ironically, that means the actual announcements are beginning to wrap up.\nWe're not on the ground in Vegas this year, but we are keeping close watch from afar to collect just the juicy photography-related news and round it up for you.\nHere are the most important announcements, awards and releases (so far). We'll be updating this post as announcements roll out throughout the show, which runs until Friday, January 12th.\nThis post will be updated live throughout CES 2024. Check back for the latest announcements.\nComments\n1 piece of camera news... a lens... weeeeee....\nSo, what you're saying is that there's one thing, a Panasonic Macro lens ;)\nI was lucky enough to get invited to the show last year. It really is an amazing, and overwhelming experience. You can see everything from small phone chargers to prototype $200,000 cars - and more.\nThere were some great photo products last year, with stands from Canon, Nikon, Sony, and others. The most interesting photo thing (to me) last year was a video setup from Sony where you would attach little transmitters to your feet, hands, head and go through various motions that were automatically mapped to computer generated avatars on screen.\nI'd love to have gone this year, but no invite!\nSony's Apple Vision Pro competitor #4 link is not working for me? Goes to a dpr page not found.\nOther than the Panasonic 100mm macro lens most of this stuff is just miscellaneous gadgets with little connection to photography.\nWhat we now know as photography, cameras and the like is virtually dead. In a few more years, these tools will no longer be widely used. There will be a professional high end for sports and studio photography, but nothing else will be used for. And not just because of the rise of mobile. It's because people have become averse to cameras.\nSolid state haptic buttons aren't going to have the mass to ALSO vibrate when the phone rings. I think the announcement forgot that the \"haptic\" button leverages the existing, necessary, much larger phone/watch vibration module, to replace a physical depress switch with a very precise movement. A piezo is not going to replace the larger vibration module unless it's also able to vibrate the whole phone enough so my butt knows I'm getting a call. :)\nWanna know the reason CES (pushing new camera gear) has been dead for the last few years?\nThere's millions of good quality DSLRs out there selling for rock bottom prices, with lenses for those cams going for dirt cheap prices.\nMirrorless is a huge expense that this troubled economy is not willing to take on.\nSmartphones.\nWhy not both?\nThe reason why cameras are disappearing is that people are becoming averse to using them and to the sight of them. On the street, the camera is now mobile and not only for the users but also for the subjects. They hate being approached with a camera, it makes them tense.\nI guess CES isn't for the camera industry.\nCES is like walking into Best Buy.\nMost people are look at the new laptop, TV, phone and other newer tech.\nThere is a photoraphy section at best buy, like the smart refrigeratior, haveing a present but not as big.\nPlus these product are yearly release.\nThe amount of new laptop model reviews ae very heavy this week.\nJust got a discountined 2023 laptop model with the new 2024 announcment.\nCIPA maybe more for photography.\nHaven't you noticed the consumer cameras have fallen off a cliff since, say oh, 2012?\nYeah, just use the DPR camera timeline to go back and see how many cameras that were announced in early January through the years. Used to be a lot of cameras, especially compacts, but we all know what happened to that market segment.\nLeica BLK2GO is for architect and the construction field.\nI remebered getting a lecia field image of an as-built airport you can pick dimensions from the picture since it has 3d point builtin.\nThsi nexer version is better of course.\nMatterport seem to be close in concept and much cheaper.\nWhere are the news items?\nThey're right there in the article, at least on the mobile site. Another poster below also seems to have trouble finding them, not sure why.\nPlease add new items to the _end_ of the list instead of breaking links on a dynamic article.\nGuess how I found out ...\nhttps://www.dpreview.com/news/4871236776/ces-2024-cameras-photography-news?slide=2\nWhat shall it be?\n- Canon MS500- Apple Vision Pro- Panasonic Lumix S 100mm F2.8 macro lens\nPlease! Don't break your part of the internet.\nHuh, and here I thought this was the Consumer Electronics Show! Gigadollar industrial equipment is cool and all, but what do they have to offer me?\nSometimes leading edge tech takes a while to trickle down from specialized applications to consumer items.\nWe're still receiving dividends from the USA space program for example and that was from stuff invented decades ago.\nIt used to be consumer oriented.\nThis is a little annoying. I came to read this, and as of early Monday morning (right now, as I am posting this comment) there aren't just a couple of announcements. There are NO announcements. Why even post this article before you have ANY content for it?!?\nClick the number buttons under the picture, There ARE already some news items, although none really interesting yet\nTrying to wrap me noggin around a camera capturing\nthe path of a ray of light. How is the sensor getting enough light at those shutter speeds to form a picture. Can't compute. Brain spaghetti.\nI thought a SPAD was a \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcSignal Passed at Danger\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 - absolutely not a good thing if on a train \u00f0\u0178\u0161\u201a\u00e2\ufffd\u201c\nThe OG SPAD:\nhttps://static.wixstatic.com/media/8948a4_bd538bbedef64d9685aa75fb4c9af99f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_640,h_454,al_c,q_80,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_auto/8948a4_bd538bbedef64d9685aa75fb4c9af99f~mv2.jpg\nEven better \u00f0\u0178\u2018\ufffd\u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u0160\nEven worse perhaps, but without the same immediate danger to life of the other two, \"A special adviser (SpAd) is a temporary civil servant who advises and assists UK government ministers or ministers in the Scottish and Welsh devolved governments They differ from impartial civil servants in that they are political appointees.\nSpecial advisers are paid by the government and appointed under Section 15 of the Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010.

If you need physical response then something has to move.\nDoes an electric shock count als physical response? ;-)\nHuh, the Canon and Leica products are commercial and industrial products which are being shown at the CONSUMER Electronics Show?\nNever hurts the Brand to show off leading edge tech...\nPlus with the Canon product people already rent ultra high-speed cameras to make unusual You-Tube videos so why not this too...\nRegarding the SPAD \"photon-counting technique\", are there any applications of this for high performance film scanners? As I understand it, true drum-scanners for film use photo-multiplier tubes which can react to (I think) individual photons which is why they are considered the ultimate film scanners. So I was wondering if this SPAD technology could perform an equivalent function with a solid state solution?\nYou may also like\nLatest sample galleries\nLatest in-depth reviews\nThe Sony a9 III is the world's first full-frame mirrorless camera to feature a global electronic shutter with simultaneous readout.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: Everything you need to know about the camera and tech showcase\nThe world's biggest technology show, CES 2024 is taking place in Las Vegas next week.\u00a0What camera kit will be there?\nCES 2024, the biggest technology event in the world, is taking place next week \u2013\u00a0and it's going to be the site of some huge announcements in the world of electronics.\nAs always (at least, when there's not a pandemic), CES 2024 will be held in Las Vegas, Nevada and runs from January 09-12. Last year saw 117,000 visitors and 3,200 exhibitors at the event, including the biggest technology giants such as Google and Microsoft.\nOf specific interest to us, of course, are the imaging giants who are participating at this year's show: Canon, Nikon, Sony, Panasonic, Fujifilm and Adobe. While CES 2024 is a general technology showcase, not one dedicated to photography or videography in specific, it has been used as a launchpad for cameras and imaging tech. And with both video and AI being cornerstones of this year's event, we're sure to see some exciting launches.\nFull details on the show can be found at the CES website.\u00a0For now, here's what we're excited about and what we expect to see\u2026\nWhen is CES 2024?\nCES 2023 will take place in its traditional home of Las Vegas, Nevada, running from Tuesday January 09 to Friday January 12.\nThe event emanates from the Las Vegas Convention Center. If you're in the area, attendance details are on the CES website.\nWhat do we expect at CES 2024?\nSony\nWord has it that Sony could announce five cameras this year, among them the Sony A1 II, A7S IV, FX3 II and ZV-E10 II. With all of these featuring headline video capabilities, it would certainly be the right time and place to debut at the video-obsessed CES.\nPersonally I think it's waaaaaay too early for a Sony A1 successor, though with a new rumor that the company could replace the Sony A7S III (and the A7S line altogether) and the Sony FX3 with the FX3 II, this feels like a new pillar that would be well-cemented in Las Vegas.\nPanasonic\nThere's been plenty of chatter about replacements for the Panasonic S1 / S1R, Panasonic S1H and Panasonic GH6. And given that the company launched the Panasonic S5X and S5 IIX last January, it's entirely possible that an S1R II, S1H II and GH7 could be revealed at CES 2024.\nOf course, as a general tech giant, we could see plenty of other adjacent imaging breakthroughs. At last year's show Panasonic announced \"life changing\" smart glasses, made in conjunction with Biel Glasses, using AI to help users with impaired vision.\nHeck, maybe we might finally see Panasonic announce something 8K-related\u2026\nCanon\nWill CES 2024 be the launchpad for the highly anticipated Canon EOS R1? We all know that the new flagship is on the way, and that it's intended to launch in time for the Paris Olympics, so time is running out for Canon to show it to the world.\nThere are plenty of other possibilities, too. The Canon EOS R5 II feels a little ambitious, but Canon has a habit of showcasing its latest collection of concept cameras \u2013\u00a0many of which have made it to market, such as the Canon PowerShot Zoom and Canon PowerShot Pick. These are always fascinating glimpses into the future, and I'm excited to see what's on show this year!\nNikon\nAfter a knockout year in 2023, Nikon could capitalize by taking the bull by the horns early in 2024. The likeliest candidate to me would be the Nikon Z6 III, which is widely expected to be here any minute.\nThere has also been a wild rumor about a Nikon Z9H \u2013\u00a0a speed-oriented version of the Nikon Z9. The \"H\" is ostensibly a nod to the suffix Nikon used to give to its flagship cameras to denote particular performance specialisms \u2013\u00a0such as the Nikon D1H, which was a speed-oriented upgrade of the base D1.\u00a0Personally I'll believe this one when I see it!\nFujifilm\nThis feels like a bit of a long shot, as Fujifilm is usually more at home announcing products on its home turf at CP+. That said, with reports that the manufacturer will launch more cameras in January alone than it did in 2023 as a whole, a launch or announcement isn't out of the question.\nWhat could this be? Well, a follow-up to the Fujifilm X100V is widely expected \u2013 and given what a blockbuster success that camera was, it could be a good fit for the broader-appeal of CES 2024. An outside chance would be the Instax Mini 99, which sounds like it might be a disruptive product.\nCES 2024 announcements\nLaCie Rugged Mini SSD\nThe palm-sized LaCie Rugged Mini SSD has been announced in capacities up to 4TB offering IP54 dust and rain resistance, 3-meter drop protection and 1-ton car pressure resistance.\u00a0No need to baby your portable SSD any more!\nLaCie claims write speeds of up to 2000MB/s, with USB 3.2 gen 2x2 and compatibility with USB 40Gbps, USB 10Gps, Thunderbolt 4 and Thunderbolt 3 hosts including the latest Apple iPad, iPhone and Macbooks.

The latest roadmap features the addition of three new lenses: a large-diameter mid-telephoto prime lens, a standard macro lens, and an ultra-wide-angle prime lens.\nFujifilm has been expanding the lineup of XF lenses to broaden the appeal of premium image quality and advanced mobility made possible by the X Mount system1. As part of this expansion, a medium telephoto prime lens joins the new generation of large-aperture prime lenses, which will now cover broad focal lengths from 18mm (wide angle, equivalent to 27mm in the 35mm film format) to 56mm (mid-telephoto, equivalent to 85mm in the 35mm film format). These lenses will offer outstanding image quality and image-resolving power in an extremely broad range of photographic situations.\nAdditionally, as part of this roadmap, the compact prime series of XF lenses will have two additions: a standard macro lens and an ultra-wide-angle lens. These complement existing lenses in the XF Series by expanding the situations for suitable lens use, catering to users\u2019 diverse needs.\nInterchangeable lenses newly added to the roadmap:\nXF56mmF1.2 Lens - A fast, medium telephoto prime lens\nA mid-telephoto lens to join the new generation of \u201clarge-aperture prime lenses\u201d in the XF Series.\nXF30mmF2.8 R Macro Lens - A standard macro lens\nA compact macro lens with a standard angle of view.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.

This unique showcase will take center stage at the upcoming SOC Awards Show on February 24, 2024 at the Directors Guild of America, Hollywood, California providing an exclusive opportunity for attendees to personally view and acquire one-of-a-kind works by renowned photographers and past SOC Lifetime Achievement Award Honorees: Phillip V. Caruso, Peter Iovino, Bruce McBroom, and JoJo Whilden.\nThis groundbreaking exhibition, made possible in part through the generous support of FUJIFILM North America Corporation (Fujifilm), will feature behind-the-scenes photographs capturing the essence of the film industry's unsung heroes. Concepted and developed in collaboration with Fujifilm, the collection aims to elevate the artistry of still photography and celebrate iconic imagery that defines the world of entertainment.

The selected works are themed around the SOC Awards, creating a visual narrative that pays tribute to the resilience and creativity of those who make cinematic magic happen. As a highlight of the evening, the framed, signed photographic works shown at the exhibition will be sold to the highest bidder during the SOC Awards through a silent auction, with proceeds benefiting the SOC\u2019s support of The Vision Center, Children's Hospital Los Angeles.\nFujifilm\u2019s vice president of Electronic Imaging & Optical Devices Divisions, Victor Ha, expressed excitement about the collaboration, stating, \"Fujifilm is honored to champion this initiative which celebrates the compelling art of visual storytelling and underscores Fujifilm\u2019s commitment to supporting camera operators. While Fujifilm has built a global photography brand, it started as a film company in 1934 and those deep roots continue to flourish 90 years later. The SOC shares that duality in its recognition of the value afforded to productions not only by the contributions of camera operators and technicians, but also by on-set photographers.\"\nFor more information on the exhibit visit www.socawards.com/still-photography-exhibition-and-silent-auction/ .

        "raw_content": "The New Fujifilm X-S20 Camera is Faster and More Powerful for $1,299\nFujifilm has announced the X-S20, a much more powerful camera than its predecessor that gets significant performance boosts thanks to a new processor.\n\u201cX-S20 is truly a dream camera for any content creator looking to take their photos and videos creation to the next level, but especially for the ones that are documenting their lives, traveling the world or streaming their stories online,\u201d explains Lisa Baxt, marketing director, Electronic Imaging Division, Fujifilm North America Corporation.\n\u201cIt offers premium image quality and advanced portability, catering to a variety of image creation styles ranging from casual self-portraits to full-fledged photography and videography. With content creators turning to digital cameras more than ever before, we are confident that X-S20 will be well received by users pushing long-form content to platforms, like Twitch, especially since no fees are required to unlock the feature,\u201d continues Baxt.\nFujifilm X-S20 Combines Same Sensor With a new Processor\nWhile Fujifilm has launched a pair of new fifth-gen X-Trans CMOS image sensors in the past year, a 26-megapixel stacked sensor and a 40-megapixel non-stacked sensor, the new X-S20 uses the same fourth-generation X-Trans CMOS 4 image sensor as the Fujifilm X-S10. The 26-megapixel image sensor offers a native ISO range of 160-12,800 and expands to 80-51,200.\nThe inclusion of the X Processor 5, which was first seen in the Fujifilm X-H2S camera last year, dramatically improves the X-S20\u2019s performance and fuels many of the camera\u2019s upgrades and improvements compared to its predecessor.\nWith the new processing power offered by the upgraded X Processor 5, the X-S20 can capture more than 1,000 JPEG or compressed RAW images when using the mechanical shutter (eight frames per second), compared to the X-S10\u2019s buffer of 105 JPEG frames and 23 compressed RAW frames \u2014 a massive upgrade. When shooting uncompressed RAW images, the X-S20 offers a 35-frame buffer, up from 18 shots.\nPerformance is significantly better when using the electronic shutter at 20 frames per second, which offers a full-size image file. The X-S20 can shoot 256 JPEGs at this rate, 79 compressed RAWs, and 28 uncompressed RAWs. The X-S10 fires 32, 17, and 17 frames at those image settings, respectively.\nThe camera\u2019s five-axis in-body image stabilization (IBIS) system is also better thanks to the improved processor. Whereas the X-S10 promised up to six stops of shake correction, the X-S20 ups that rating to an impressive seven stops.\nImproved Autofocus: X-S20 Includes AI-powered Subject Detection\nAnother feature introduced in the X-H2 family has trickled down to the X-S20 in the form of AI-powered autofocus features. The X-S20 includes subject detection AF, a feature not included in the X-S10.\nThe X-S20 can automatically detect and track human face/eye, animal, bird, insect, automobile, bike, airplane, drone, and train subjects. Insect and drone are new additions. Another new feature is that the X-S20 can automatically swap between subjects in \u201cAuto\u201d mode, which is selectable from the camera\u2019s mode dial. While not related to AF, another new feature in \u201cAuto\u201d mode is the ability for the camera to switch between Fujifilm\u2019s popular Film Simulations automatically.\nDesign and Handling\nThe Fujifilm X-S20 may perform better than its predecessor, but it looks similar. However, the camera has undergone a minor facelift that should pay dividends when used.\nThe shape of the power lever has been changed to make it easier to rotate, Fujifilm has increased the diameter of some dials, increased the size of some buttons like the top ISO and Q buttons, included both a mic and headphone jack, and made the front grip a bit more comfortable.\nThe front grip is larger to fit a higher-capacity W235 lithium-ion battery, which results in about double the battery life of the X-S10. The X-S20 adds an \u201ceconomy\u201d mode that promises up to 800 frames when using the LCD and 750 frames with the EVF. The X-S10\u2019s best performance was in \u201cnormal\u201d mode, which topped out at 325 frames. In normal mode, the X-S20 is rated for 750 frames using the LCD or EVF.\nConcerning displays, the X-S20 has a 0.62x magnification EVF with 2.36 million dots and a 100 fps refresh rate. Both the X-S10 and X-S20 include a 3-inch rear display. However, the X-S20\u2019s display has 1.84M dots, whereas the X-S10\u2019s rear panel has 1.04M dots.\nThe larger grip adds about 1.7 millimeters (0.07 inches) of width and 26 grams (0.92 ounces) to the X-S20 compared to its predecessor. The camera\u2019s overall dimensions (width x height x depth) are 127.7 x 85.1 x 65.4 millimeters (5.03 x 3.35 x 2.57 inches), and the X-S20 weighs 491 grams (17.3 ounces) with its battery and memory card inserted.\nAnother difference between the X-S10 and the new X-S20 is that Fujifilm\u2019s new camera is compatible with the cooling fan accessory (Fujifilm Fan-001) that was announced alongside the X-H2 camera. The $199 add-on significantly increases recording longevity.\nX-S20 Video Features: Major Improvements\nVideo is an area of expanded focus for Fujifilm. The content creator market has grown significantly since the X-S10 hit stores in 2020, and the X-S20 responds to the burgeoning market sector.\nWith its increased processing power, the X-S20 can internally record 6.2K/30p 4:2:2 10-bit open gate video, alongside DCI4K/60p, 1080/240p, and 1080/60p (Long Play) recording modes.\nWhen externally recording over HDMI, the X-S20 can record 12-bit Apple ProRes and Blackmagic RAW video at 6.2K/30p and 5.2K/30p.\nThe X-S20 includes F-Log2, which promises 13-plus stops of dynamic range. This is a one-stop improvement over the F-Log version available in the X-S10.\nThe X-S20 includes a new \u201cVlog\u201d mode on its mode dial. This mode integrates vlogging-specific functions into the camera\u2019s touch menu, including self-timer, face/eye detection, product priority focus mode, IS mode, high-speed recording, and background defocus mode options.\nProduct priority mode disables face/eye detect autofocus, while background defocus mode opens the aperture of the attached lens to provide more background blur.\nThe X-S20 also includes HVC/UAC support to allow the camera to act as a webcam without a special app. Users plug the camera into their computer, and it acts as a webcam source in popular video conferencing apps.\nCompared to the X-S10, the X-S20\u2019s video features are much more robust. New and improved performance includes 6.2K resolution, a 360Mbps max bit rate that is nearly double that of the X-S10, 4:2:2 internal recording, 12-bit RAW output over HDMI, and F-Log2.\nThe X-S20 also offers expanded continuous recording time thanks to the optional cooling fan accessory. When using the fan, 6.2K video can be recorded for nearly 80 minutes at room temperature. That\u2019s more than double what\u2019s possible without the fan.\nPricing and Availability\nThe Fujifilm X-S20 will be available on or around June 29 for $1,299.95. Unlike some other Fujifilm bodies, the X-S20 is only available with a black finish.\nThe X-S20 will also ship in two kits. One comes with the Fujinon XC 15-45mm f/3.5-5.6 OIS PZ lens for $1,399.95. The other ships with the venerable Fujinon XF 18-55mm f/2.8-4 R LM OIS lens for $1,699.95.\nImage credits: Product images courtesy of Fujifilm | Lifestyle images \u00a9 Ryan Tuttle\n\u00a9 2024 PetaPixel Inc.

        "raw_content": "Fujifilm releases X100V with new sensor, new lens and tilting touchscreen\nThe Fujifilm X100V has arrived and represents that biggest re-working of the camera since the series arrived nearly ten years ago. While the additions and updates are a little bigger than before, Fujifilm hasn't messed too much with the basic formula that's made the X100 so popular.\nWe still have an APS-C sensor, a 35mm-equivalent F2 lens and a hybrid optical-and-electronic viewfinder, but all of those have been updated. The sensor is Fujifilm's latest 26MP X-Trans unit we first saw on the X-T3 and X-Pro3 interchangeable lens cameras, the lens has been redesigned to improve close-up and corner performance, and the viewfinder is all-new and has an OLED panel instead of the LCD panel on older models.\nBeyond that, a new tilting screen mechanism doesn't add much bulk to the camera, but makes it much easier to shoot from the hip. The addition of 4K video with F-log internal recording, alongside various capture aids and Fujifilm's 'Movie Silent Control' system give the camera some serious video chops. Burst speeds of up to 20 fps with the electronic shutter, improved battery life and claimed weather-sealing (provided you attach the AR-X100 filter ring and a filter to the front of the lens) complete the package.\nPut all of this together, and you get the most well-rounded and capable fixed-lens compact camera on the market today. Fujifilm says the X100V will be available in late February 2020 at a price of $1399, or $1799 CAD.\nPress release:\nINTRODUCING THE FUJIFILM X100V: MAKE EVERYDAY REMARKABLE\nValhalla, New York - February 4, 2020 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c FUJIFILM North America Corporation is pleased to announce the launch of the FUJIFILM X100V (X100V), the latest model in a long line of iconic, portable, and fun X100 premium compact digital cameras.\nThe fifth iteration in Fujifilm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s X100 Series, the X100V is a significant upgrade over previous X100 line models. Featuring a new 23mmF2 lens, advanced hybrid viewfinder, optional weather resistance*, and 2-way tilting rear LCD screen, among a host of other product line updates, the X100V also uses the latest generation X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor and X-Processor 4 to provide all creatives from professionals to everyday image makers with an easy to use, fully capable, and sophisticated tool that provides incredible image quality when shooting both stills and video.\nKey features and improvements of X100V include:\nSophisticated appearance, advanced operability and classical design\nX100V\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s timeless body has top and bottom plates milled from single pieces of aluminum, which results in a refined and classic camera body with clean edges. Finished with a beautiful satin coating, slight enhancements have also been made to the camera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s grip, ISO dial, and lens barrel to make it incredibly comfortable to hold and operate. Weather resistance appears for the first time in the X100 line when the optional AR-X100 adapter ring and the PRF-49 protection filter are attached. Additionally, a new two-way tilting touchscreen LCD screen fits flush at the back of the camera and provides intuitive touch controls, unlocking even more possibilities for image-makers to see, frame, and create images.\nA new lens to make the most out of any image\nX100V features a new 23mmF2.0 lens to ensure that every detail from its X-TRANSTM CMOS 4 Sensor is resolved beautifully. Designed for higher resolution, lower distortion and improved close focus performance, this lens is a significant upgrade from the design used on previous X100 cameras, while maintaining the same overall size and compatibility with legacy WCL/TCL conversion lenses, and retaining its internal ND filter that now features 4 stops.\nAt the heart of X100V is the state-of-the-art X-Trans CMOS 4 sensor and X-Processor 4 combination. The exceptional 26.1MP sensor uses a back-illuminated design to maximize quality and dynamic range, while its unique color filter array controls moire\u00cc\ufffd and false color without the need for an optical low pass filter. Such outstanding imaging capability is complemented by the quad-core X-Processor 4. This powerful CPU not\nonly ensures images are quickly and smoothly processed, but also, thanks to a new algorithm, boosts AF performance with precision face and eye detection down to -5EV.\nTwo ways to see an image\nX100V\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s vastly improved hybrid viewfinder enables image-makers to quickly and easily choose between the 0.52x magnification optical viewfinder (OVF) or the 3.69M dot OLED electronic viewfinder to make their images. Offering 95% frame coverage, the OVF provides parallax-correcting frame lines to provide an uninterrupted view of the world, while the camera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s EVF delivers a real-time representation of the image as it is being made. The Electronic Rangefinder (ERF) function can also be selected to display a small EVF at the bottom right corner of the OVF, which gives image-makers another helpful tool as they frame and make their images.\nMore than just a still camera\nX100V offers the ability to record 4K video at up to 30 frames per second or capture 120 frames per second at 1080p to create super slow motion effects. Filmmakers needing extreme color fidelity can record 10-bit, 4:2:2 color externally via the HDMI port and leverage Fujifilm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s advanced color reproduction technology, to apply film simulations, like \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Eterna\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd, to their video footage. Additionally, image makers can also incorporate numerous shooting functions, such as \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Monochrome Adjustments\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd and \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Color Chrome\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd to extend their creative visions directly to the footage being recorded.\nOptional accessories\nUse the wide conversion lens (WCL-X100 II) or tele-conversion lens (TCL-X100 II) to extend X100V\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fixed 23mm focal length to a 28mm equivalent (0.8x) or 50mm (1.4x) equivalent lens on a 35mm format system.\nAdd a premium, genuine leather case (LC-X100V) to X100V to complement its classic design, while giving complete access to the camera\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s battery and memory card without removing the X100V from its case.\nX100V will be available in both black and silver and is expected to be available for sale in late February 2020 at a manufacturer\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s suggested retail price of $1,399.95 USD and $1,799.99 CAD.

I thought it being a premium price for a premium camera in their line-up they might buck-up for at the very least a user manual. Nope!Leica will on request mail (post) a user manual from Germany free of charge to a registered owner of their cameras. At least in Canada there was no charger or user manual included with the XPRO3 - so not totally a surprise.\nNo user manual?\nUnbelievable.\nSend it back.\nDid your XT1 come with a manual and charger? That is the point in case you missed it. Besides it hasn't arrived yet - so sending it back might be a bit difficult \u00f0\u0178\u00a5\u00b4\nAnd people were saying the GR III was expensive, without a flash... I'm waiting for the post that will say here \"No IBIS, no sale\"...\nThe image sensor isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t new if it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already been in 2 older cameras.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ve always liked the silver version better but for this generation the black version is gorgeous!\nI can always mount a prime lens of choice to my X-E3 permanently and use it as a \"fixed lens, single focal length\" camera.\nWith any of the X100 variants, I'm stuck with the built-in lens. My smartphone camera is like that, too.\nNot exactly. There are the WCL-X100 and the TCL-X100 converters which turn the lens to 28 and 50 mm FF equivalent lenses.\nYes, of course you can. It will be bigger and with the external flash, even bigger. The point of the x100 series is a self-contained, compact system. Also the x100 leaf shutter allows for high sync speeds with the flash. Many people buy it and decide it is not for them and sell it. People just need to know what they want and decide for themselves if x100 is for them.\nYour X-E3 doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have an OVF\n@black pearl nobody needs OVF today, dad.\n@ Miric: Nobody \"needs\" an dedicated camera either. ;-)\n@Toni Salmonelli I need. With the a regular FF Bayer sensor. Not a stuff like this.\n@ Miric: This was a joke of course. What I meant to say is, that some might prefer an OVF for whatever reason. Just like enthusiast photographers prefer to spend a lot money and time when a smartphone albeit smartphones take pictures too.\nEvery time I see a new release of the X100 series, I just dissolve into lust.\nget one of the older models 2nd hand, i got the original X100 a few years back for \u00a3200, well worth it, it still had the original firmware on it and the upgrade made a massive difference\nVacation machine!\nYup. You also may feel free to erase the card upon return without any regrets.\nA lot of money for a fixed-lens, but it looks well-built and the lens choice is a good one.\nI agree, it costs quite a bit. I bought my x100f camera used in excellent condition for about $400 less than a new one. If people are willing to wait 6 months to a year, they can save a few hundred buying from people that decide an x100 is not for them.\nThat\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a beautiful camera.\nI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t need one but later on in the future if I have the extra cash I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll get one.\nJust because.\n\"Use the wide conversion lens (WCL-X100 II) or tele-conversion lens (TCL-X100 II) to extend X100V\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fixed 23mm focal length to a 28mm equivalent (0.8x) or 50mm (1.4x) equivalent lens on a 35mm format system.\"\nThe old ones won't fit?\nYes, they fit. Difference being newer ones take away need to change a setting in menus (it is automatic).There is a 'fix' for the old one's mind (check YouTube)\nSomeone from dpreview confirmed (in a comment posting) that the older ones were verified to work with x100v.\nNow that we've finally seen the X100V we can't wait to see the X100VI!\nOk.\nThe thrill is gone.\nOn to vi.\nAnother three long year wait\nToo bad they decide not to allow the 4:3 ratio on the EVF like i think they now allow on the new entry level XT 200.... i would have bought it for sure\nseriously?\nThis is a dealbreaker?\nYes , absolutely. For my work, i shoot maybe 80% of my work in vertical and the 3.2 ratio is useless in that orientation. This is why I shoot micro 4/3.\nGuess I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122ll have to spend today refunding everyone who bought an upright 16:9 (my preferred ratio) print from me \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u00b7\u00f0\u0178\ufffd\u00bc\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\u00e2\u2122\u201a\u00ef\u00b8\ufffd\nDifferent people, different needs. No need to be sarcastic\n_The V of this Fuji X100Vstands for \"Venerable\"!\nA true gem...\n\"V\" for Vendetta \u00f0\u0178\u2018\u00b9\nX-trans in 2020? C'mon Fuji, it's not really needed for 26MP resolution and simply mucks things up for RAW processing.\nCorrect. The cam is beautiful, but I won't change my workflow for it.\nAgreed. X-Trans had its advantage in 16 mp sensors but as resolution increased that advantage quickly diminished.\nThey even know it and got rid of it in the GFX-line... I would serously consider buying a black one with Bayer.\nyes, plus the jpegs are so ugly...\nBeautiful camera, too bad the lens isn't a 20-35 f/3 equivalent. Alas this will be more than $2K in Australia which is ludicrous money.\nyes, $2290 precisely= no buy for me\nGuess I don't need to upgrade the X100F.\nNo point in having 4K video with no stabilization.\nAnd I'm not going to leave a filter adapter and filter on there for weather sealing.\nSony RX1R II should still offer better image Quality than the Fujifilm X100V, The Sony will have a sharper lens etc.\nAt the same price?\nAbout 2.5x...\nYou can fit an X100 into a large pants pocket, especially cargo shorts.\nRX1R?\nDoubtful.\nI agree, most full-frame cameras will offer better sensors and lens. A small BMW is nice but a big expensive BMW is way nicer. Very different comparison, different price point, etc. No point in trying to compare. If you want the full frame and are willing to pay for it, why spend time looking at x100v?\nAlso how much do you like the optical VF option? If you love it the XPro3 is the only alternative, and that's large...\n\"Put all of this together, and you get the most well-rounded and capable fixed-lens compact camera on the market today.\"\nI disagree. While I welcome the new sensor and improved specs, I think the 35mm focal length really holds this camera back.\nI really never liked the shots from my X100s, mainly because of the perspective. I think 24mm or 40/45mm would be more interesting. Furthermore, I think the iPhone 11 pro or the Samsung s10 or the Huawei P30 Pro are more well-rounded and capable cameras. Each has an ultra wide lens, a wide lens, and a normal lens. I have a professional photographer friend who asserts the ultra wide lens (12mm) in the S10 is one of the best ultra wide lenses he's ever used. The iPhone 11 Pro in particular will be far more useful than the X100V\nfor shooting video. It shoots stabilized HDR 4K video that competes with or surpasses the GH5 for dynamic range. Here is an impressive sample of what it can do: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jFb2_-XiIuc\nAs far as I can remember, iPhones, Samsungs and Huaweis are phones, not \"fixed-lens compact cameras\".\n@juntoalmar: why not both? Phones have stopped being just phones long ago. I barely make phone calls at all with mine.\njuntoalmar, but they are cameras, they're compact, and all the lenses in these phones are fixed-length primes.\nTruth be told, though, I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t find the video example very convincing. The author clearly put an impressive amount of effort into the content, the transitions, the music, etc. but to me, the visual recording quality itself is not very satisfying.\nYes i dislike the 35mm focal length as well. If it had a 40mm equivalent and the possibility to shoot 4:3 with the evf . It may have replaced my ricoh gr2 as my go everyday everywhere camera\nYep when you right your right you need to use your phone for video and forget the 35mm focal length its to photographic.\nI'd like 28 or 40... plus some sort of stabilisation (in-lens, in-body) so all that video stuff isn't pointless...\nI d pay more to get a 40mm equivalent and to be able to shoot 4:3 ratio with the evf and the lcd\nin other words, you have no idea what you're talking about.\nFor all those who complain about uninteresting 35mm lens. There is a X-T30 + XF27/2.8...\nSounds like they gave everyone all that they were asking for. Weather sealing, tilt scree, newer sensor. Looks great! Just don't know why they didn't use this style of tilt screen on the X-Pro3.\nImage stabilization is the glaring omission.\nAnd a Bayer CFA.\nNot a new image sensor. Already been used.\nThe weather sealing, tilt screen, sharper lens, more premium finish, improved AF,\nand greatly improved video make this a major update over the X100F.\nI love the way the tilt screen lies flush the the rear and does not seem to add any bulk to the camera.\nThis looks absolutely tremendous - I want one!\nNew lens, at last!\nNow, how will it perform..\nSoooo... black or silver? :-)\nWell, I presume you have two hands so... why not both? \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u2030\nNo snake-leather-Lenny-Kravitz-branded option? :D\nA terrible lame event, but Fuji delivers with this awesome camera. Can't wait to get a black one.\nAwesome! Sharper lens, tilt screen, WR, improved autofocus.. This will be a great little camera!

Is the extra optical oomph worth the upgrade over the iPhone 15 Pro\u2019s 3x (77mm equivalent) telephoto?\nApple's $3,499 \"spatial computer\" is now officially available for preorder, with orders shipping on February 2nd alongside in-store availability.\nWe're as guilty as anyone of getting excited about shiny new gear and features, but let's not lose sight of the gear we already have by our side. Let's better appreciate what we have, consider what gives us joy, and get out there to take some photos.\nSony is bringing a shutter angle setting to its two more affordable alpha-branded Cinema Line cameras, the FX3 and FX30, with a firmware update. Just don't expect it to roll out until later this year.\nDJI just released the Mic 2, the follow-up to its first wireless microphone system. Here's what you need to know.\nCamera technical details can get complicated quickly, but we all need a place to start before diving into the deep end. We've assembled a few of our favorite articles, tutorials, explainers, and guides to help beginners get started with photography and level up to advanced concepts.\nSony's new 16-35mm F2.8 GM II lens is a real peach thanks to a small, light footprint, fast, silent autofocus, and outstanding optical performance.\nThe Nikon Zf is a 24MP full-frame mirrorless camera with classic looks that adds the latest Expeed 7 processor and features such as 3D Tracking AF to the $2000 price bracket. We're not sure the experience lives up to the looks.\nDo you want to shape and create content for the largest audience of photography and video enthusiasts in the world? DPReview is hiring a Reviews Editor to join our Seattle-based team.\nTenba knows how to make a bag, and the Axis V2 18L is no exception. But this chunky yet competent backpack doesn't have a killer feature or look that makes it stand out from some pretty tough competition.\nAs CES 2024 draws to a close, one thing is absolutely clear: AI is everywhere, for better or for worse.\nWhat surprises await us in 2024? Here are 13 serious (and not-so-serious) guesses.\nAs part of completing our Nikon Zf review, we've run the camera through our standard test scene, to see how it performs.\nThe Consumer Electronics Tradeshow of 2024 is kicking off, and while we don't expect any huge camera announcements, there are plenty of other bits and bobs of interest to the photographically inclined. Here are all the most important announcements, awards and releases (so far).\nDPReview readers have spoken: after two rounds of voting, it's time to announce the winner of our 2023 Reader's Choice Product of the Year award, along with a couple of honorable mentions. Find out which cameras and lenses topped the list!\nPanasonic's Lumix S 100mm F2.8 Macro is a full-frame L-mount lens that's designed to be a medium telephoto, portrait and macro lens all-in-one. We took to the streets for some portraits and shot a few macro photos for this first installment in our sample gallery.\nIn conjunction with CES 2024, Panasonic has announced the Lumix S 100mm F2.8 Macro lens for full-frame L-mount bodies. Panasonic is calling it \"the world\u2019s smallest and lightest medium-telephoto fixed focal length macro lens,\" and it aims to act as a macro and medium telephoto lens with equal aplomb.\nThe Sony a9 III is the world's first full-frame mirrorless camera to feature a global electronic shutter with simultaneous readout. We've been using a full production version of this 120 fps sports camera, to see what you gain (and, perhaps, lose).\nIt\u2019s a new year, make those photo/video resolutions count! It\u2019s time to start learning; here are some of our best reads for better understanding cameras and how to get the most out of them.\nSony says the a9 III's sensor offers \"global shutter without compromise.\" Our studio tests suggest this isn't quite the case. We've taken a closer look at the image quality and dynamic range impact of the move to a Stacked CMOS global shutter sensor.\nThere were 21 major camera releases in 2023. Here's a roundup of all of them.\nFor the past few weeks, our readers have been voting on their favorite cameras and lenses released last year.

Here\u2019s how it works.\nCES 2024: everything you need to know about this year's huge tech event\nHere\u2019s what we expect to see\nWith virtual events a now-distant memory, CES 2024 is set to be a massive consumer electronics show at full strength. The CTA, which organizes the Las Vegas, Nevada, expo, is expecting over 3,500 exhibitors spread across 2.4 million square feet of exhibit space.\nThere should be a betting pool on how many tech companies will leverage the eye-popping Sphere's insane display capabilities.\nAttendees (which will include a contingent of TechRadar editors and reporters) can expect to find new releases and innovations across a wide swath of technology, including laptops, wearables, health and beauty tech, smart home technology, TVs and home entertainment, automotive and EV, and a lot of AI.\nAmong the companies expected to lead the announcement charge are Nvidia, Intel, L'Or\u00e9al, Hyundai, AMD, Samsung, Sony, and many others.\nWhether you\u2019re attending CES 2024 in person or plan to watch this year\u2019s edition of the annual trade show online, we\u2019ll be reporting on the biggest announcements as and when they happen. Below, we speculate on what products could be unveiled throughout the four-day showcase.\nCES 2024 dates and hours\nCES 2024 will run from Tuesday, January 9 until Friday, January 12, 2024.\nThe event\u2019s opening keynote and state of the industry address will kick off at 8:30am PT on January 9 (11:30am ET on January 9 / 4:30pm GMT on January 9 / 2:30am AEST on January 10).\nAs for the in-person exhibitions, those of you looking to check out the happenings at the Las Vegas Convention and World Trade Center (LVCC) or the Venetian Expo will be able to visit during the following times:\n10am - 6pm PT Tuesday, January 9\n9am - 6pm PT Wednesday, January 10\n9am - 6pm PT Thursday, January 11\n9am - 4pm PT Sunday, January 12\nMeanwhile, those of you looking to visit the home entertainment-focused C Space at the ARIA will be able to check it out from 9am PT to 6pm PT on Monday, January 8, until Thursday, January 11.\nHow to register for CES 2024\nCES is a trade-only event for people aged 18 and over who are affiliated with the consumer technology industry; so to attend, you\u2019ll need to be associated with a tech company or an appropriate media publication.\nIf you fit these criteria, to register for CES 2024 you\u2019ll need to visit the official CES 2024 registration page and fill out the appropriate form.\nAs part of the application process, you\u2019ll need to provide a photo of yourself, details about the company you work for and your role there, and proof of your industry affiliation.\nWhich brands are attending?\nSamsung at CES 2024\nSamsung has a long history of mega-booths and massive product rollouts and CES 2024 will be no different. However, the major focus this year will be AI (actually a major theme across the whole of CES 2024).\nIn addition to its Center Hall booth, Samsung will hold a major press conference to announce all of its major updates.\nIn the TV realm, we're expecting brighter OLED models, since that's one of the specs that matters most to consumers. \u00a0They'll bring out the new 8K displays and, yes, more microLEDs at probably even bigger sizes.\nAlso expect updates on projectors (even short-throw 8K ones), appliances, laptops and tablets, and sustainability (a show theme). We should see some more smart home ideas (more Matter support updates) from the South Korean tech giant and maybe even a surprise or two.\nSony at CES 2024\nLast year, Sony revealed an exciting EV concept with a terrible name: Afeela. Will the company show yet another iteration of this car that it's been working on for at least four years? Maybe.\nHonestly, the company doesn\u2019t seem to show much else at CES anymore. We\u2019re not expecting anything TV and audio (though there might be some other home theater tech), for example. Perhaps we\u2019ll get a tease of future PlayStation hardware updates, though, with the PS5 Slim and PlayStation Portal only recently launched, that looks far from certain.\nAlso a longer than long shot is an AIBO robot dog update (though we can always hope). The truth is that, at least in recent years, Sony just hasn\u2019t been that much of a CES draw!\nLG at CES 2024\nExpect LG to operate on the same two tracks it's traveled in previous CES events: appliances and displays. On the display side, LG will no doubt push OLED into new areas as it always does \u2013 we\u2019re not sure whether to expect any more bending screens, but it\u2019ll definitely put OLED in just about anything else with pixels. We hope it\u2019ll bring its groundbreaking MLA OLED tech to more affordable models this year, but we\u2019ll see.\nThe appliances side will also show new and ever-smart home tech, including robot vacuums, refrigerators, washing machines, and other surprising home stuff \u2013 we\u2019ve seen the company show indoor vegetable gardens and perfectly spherical home ice machines before. There will also be talk about Matter support and sustainability.\nHisense at CES 2024\nHisense will be attending CES 2024, with an exhibit in LVCC's Central Hall.\nIt's another company that focuses on TVs and appliances mostly. We know the company has a new range of 2024 TVs to show off, but we also know that they\u2019re going to be extremely similar to 2023\u2019s TVs, with one big exception: and new flagship TV that will be the company\u2019s brightest-ever, with over 5,000 nits of brightness, new anti-reflection tech, and more dimming zones than the company\u2019s ever put in a mini-LED TV.\nIntel at CES 2024\nAs far as Intel and CES 2024 goes, it is going to be all about Meteor Lake and the new Intel Core Ultra processors with built-in neural processing units (NPUs). Of course, Intel announced these chips months ago and they officially launched on December 14, but given that they\u2019re exclusively mobile chips (for now), an Intel launch doesn\u2019t mean that you can get a laptop with a Core Ultra chip in it ahead of CES.\nMost manufacturers\u2019 production cycles aren\u2019t set up to launch new products in December, so the first laptops we\u2019ll get our hands on with the new processors will be coming in the months ahead. However, the first chance we\u2019ll get to see them in person will be in the second week of January.\nSo in a lot of ways, it\u2019s not Intel we\u2019re talking about here as much as it is everyone else putting Intel Core Ultras into their stuff, and those promise to run the gamut from straightforward refreshes of business laptops to exciting new designs that leverage the new hybrid+ architecture featuring performance cores, efficiency cores, and low-power efficiency cores coupled with a neural processor on the SoC that will make consumer AI applications like generative image creation or document drafting much simpler and practical.\nMost importantly, these new AI apps won\u2019t need a connection to a cloud data center to work in theory. How well they perform in reality remains to be seen, but finding out will be the most exciting thing from Intel at CES in as long as we can remember.\nAMD at CES 2024\nWith Nvidia focused like your cat on a laser pointer, CES 2024 would be a great time for AMD to make some moves to pick up market share in the GPU market, but there hasn\u2019t been any hint that a release is forthcoming on that front from Team Red.\nFor GPUs, we\u2019ll likely have to wait a few months before we see any more Radeon cards coming out, like a potential RX 7950 XT or RX 7750 XT, but AMD isn\u2019t just a graphics company.\nWith AMD\u2019s recent announcement of its Ryzen 8000-series mobile CPU, the Ryzen 9 8945HS, we expect to see a lot of laptops with the new chip in them. What\u2019s more, with the AMD Z1 and Z1 Extreme handheld chips powering devices like the Asus ROG Ally and the Lenovo Legion Go, there will be a ton of third-party products at CES 2024 around handheld gaming.\nPlus, given the consumer electronics focus of CES, if we hear anything from AMD around CES, it\u2019d likely be around handhelds rather than desktops, since a handheld portable gaming system is pretty much exactly the kind of product that CES was built to showcase.\nNvidia at CES 2024\nAfter its explosive growth into a trillion-dollar company in 2023 on the generative AI wave of ChatGPT, Dall-E, Google Bard, and Midjourney, among others, Nvidia\u2019s near total monopoly on the specialized chips that power large language models and other AI systems leaves the company at something of a crossroads as it heads into 2024.\nWhile still the maker of the best graphics cards in the world for gamers and creative professionals, the license-to-print money that is generative AI right now puts many of Nvidia\u2019s upcoming consumer products under a rather long shadow. We expect Nvidia to announce new \u201cSuper\u201d branded GPUs at CES this year, but which ones or how many we don't know.\nThis current generation of consumer Nvidia GPUs has been a very mixed bag, both on the performance side (at least at the lower end of the product stack) as well as their \u201cpremium-plus\u201d pricing. The company\u2019s flagship card, the Nvidia RTX 4090, starts at $1,699.99, while its \u201cmidrange\u201d RTX 4070 card will run you $600, putting many of Nvidia\u2019s latest graphics cards out of reach for many.\nWe don\u2019t expect any GPU announcements at CES to be much better, as these will almost certainly be a Super version of the RTX 4080 (US MSRP $1,199.99) or the RTX 4070, so it\u2019s likely that these cards will still be more than half a grand in the best case. These aren\u2019t prices that the consumer market can easily afford, and given reports of Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s memo to Nvidia staff declaring that Nvidia \u201cis no longer a graphics company\u201d but an AI company, it seems poised to pivot strongly towards its enterprise customers in 2024. If Nvidia makes a splash at CES 2024, it\u2019ll likely be with a parting gift to the consumer market on its way out the door to far more profitable horizons.\nOur predictions to CES 2024\nMobile tech at CES 2024\nCES is traditionally not a show for mobile phones, because the biggest phone show of the year happens a month later when Mobile World Congress takes over Barcelona. We\u2019re expecting some phone news, but most of it will be previews of the big phones to come or a first hands-on look at phones launched around the world.\nOur first glimpse of mobile news at CES 2024 will come from Samsung. We\u2019re expecting the Galaxy S24 series to arrive in late January or early February, so it\u2019s possible Samsung could give us hints about that phone during its keynote presentation. It has offered a brief glimpse at the end of the show in the past.\nWe\u2019re also hoping to get a look at some phones that launched in China, including the OnePlus 12 and the Xiaomi 14. Both of those phones pack the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 processor, beating Samsung to market with Qualcomm\u2019s latest AI-capable mobile platform. Hopefully, we\u2019ll get a chance to see those phones in action.\nFinally, Lenovo showed up at CES last year with new mobile gear, including the Lenovo ThinkPhone and new tablets. We\u2019ll be keeping an eye on all of our favorite mobile manufacturers, and wandering the halls looking for up-and-comers, so stay tuned.\nTelevisions at CES 2024\nWe\u2019re not expecting anything that changes the world of TVs from this year\u2019s CES, but there will be three clear tracks: brighter OLED TVs, giant TVs, and ridiculously high-spec mini-LED TVs.\nBrighter OLED happens every year, to be fair, but it was a race that heated up in 2023, with Samsung\u2019s second-gen QD-OLED tech and LG\u2019s new MLA OLED tech duking it out for supremacy. We awarded that round to Samsung, but both companies will have something new to try to get the edge in 2024, no doubt.\nIn the case of giant TVs, we\u2019re talking 98 inches to 110 inches, but at prices that aren\u2019t only for oligarchs or Taylor Swift. We\u2019ve already seen TCL\u2019s affordable 98-inch TV, and surely Hisense won\u2019t let TCL have the cheaper end all to itself. We\u2019ll probably see more giant options from Samsung as well \u2013 the TV companies seem to think this is the next big thing.\nFinally, those high-spec mini-LED TVs. TCL and Hisense will both introduce TVs with over 5,000 nits of brightness and more dimming zones than ever before. That brightness is about double what high-end Samsung 4K TVs hit right now \u2013 so perhaps Samsung will also have its own OTT option. We\u2019re not sure anyone needs this kind of brightness, but we\u2019ll have fun being proven wrong when we can spend more time with them (they\u2019ve already been shown off kind of briefly).\nComputing at CES 2024\n2023 has been a rollercoaster year when it comes to both computer hardware and software, with the meteoric rise of AI tools like the seemingly omnipresent ChatGPT setting the tone for months of innovation and new product development. AI has become the hottest topic in tech, and CES 2024 will reflect that.\nWith that in mind, the event shaping up to be a big one for the computing industry as a whole, with showings from all the major players including Intel, Nvidia, and Qualcomm. The latter is headlining the show with a keynote presentation from CEO Christiano Amon, who will be discussing the potential of Qualcomm\u2019s new AI chips - taking on-device generative AI to new heights.\nIntel CEO Pat Gelsinger has a keynote address of his own that will come in a similar flavor, with the theme being \u2018AI Everywhere\u2019. Chances are Nvidia will have its fingers in the artificial intelligence pie too since the GPU giant often uses CES as a platform for launching new mobile graphics cards - meaning we might see the hotly-anticipated Blackwell GPU architecture at the event.\nElsewhere, big hitters like Acer, Asus, and Lenovo are expected to make appearances to show off new laptop models, most likely equipped with new Meteor Lake chips from Intel and AMD\u2019s new AI-powered Hawk Point processors. We\u2019re also expecting to see key peripheral manufacturers like Logitech, Razer, and HyperX show off new hardware, meaning we\u2019re going to have full plates in January!\nAudio at CES 2024\nYou don\u2019t tend to get headphones from the biggest names at CES 2024 \u2013 Sony, Bose and so on tend to launch them separately \u2013 so a lot of sound at CES is focused on making vinyl smarter, or introducing speakers built into furniture, or companies making high-end audio smarter.\nSo we may see more hi-fi-style speakers with streaming built in from very classy names, and there will be more Bluetooth turntables aimed at beginners. And there will be earbuds for sure \u2013 one big name that does do CES is Sennheiser, and it seems like it\u2019ll have new buds for us. We also rate JLab, and the company has some great-looking high-end earbuds we should be able to try at the show.\nWearables and Health at CES 2024\nIn the wearables space last year, CES was awash with screenless smartwatches and ways to decouple wearables from yet another screen on our wrists. I believe this trend will carry on, with smart glasses, new entries in the best smart ring game, and other emerging categories set to make a splash.\nSmart glasses, in particular, will mean more opportunity for exercise gamification (there\u2019s a \u201cGaming Beyond Leisure\u201d panel this year under the Fitness section), with a push on getting people motivated to move via innovative software solutions. Just like Peloton uncoupled its app from its machines to get more people using its content in the gym, more Apple Fitness Plus-style heads-up displays that can be shown via smart glasses like the Engo 2 would make a splash in the health space.\nOn the hardware side, more advanced, discreet temperature sensors in smart rings and other small wearables will mean a lot for women\u2019s health and cycle tracking - providing US users can get past the security concerns. With the cost of living hitting hard, I think old-fashioned band-style fitness trackers are set to make a comeback, perhaps led by the Samsung Galaxy Fit 3 - although we\u2019re unlikely to see too many of these at CES as they\u2019re not particularly exciting or new.\nCES is always big on EVs, and expect the electric bike sector to be no exception. With MINI and Audi releasing electric bikes of their own, and CES being a huge opportunity for car manufacturers to showcase their new stuff, I\u2019m looking forward to seeing some new innovations in personal, pedal-powered electric mobility.\nSmart home at CES 2024\nThere's every chance we've saved the best for last here, as we think smart home technology might just dominate CES. Last year, smart home's new communication standard,\u00a0Matter, was in its infancy, but it's had a full year to mature and we've seen some excellent Matter-first products released since.\nMore and more device types are getting Matter compatibility, but what's exciting is the increased focus on AI and automation. From onboard intelligence in the best robot vacuums to the opportunities for generative AI in the best smart speaker voice assistants, we're expecting to see a heightened focus on truly smart devices and how they work together. Adjacent to that is the pivot many brands are making into new and innovative smart devices - everything from smart lawnmowers to health solutions. If it can be smartened, so it shall be.\nThere's a lot of buzz around sustainability this year, and smart home tech presents ample opportunity to lead the way. Whether it's by reducing energy usage and living costs, using more sustainable materials, and even detecting and protecting against the ravages of natural disasters, expect to see some big movers and shakers emerge on this front.\nAs always we're also anticipating more robot vacuum hype and AI development, continued improvements to the best smart home security devices like cameras and video doorbells, and hopefully some more wonderful smart lights.\nGet daily insight, inspiration and deals in your inbox\nGet the hottest deals available in your inbox plus news, reviews, opinion, analysis and more from the TechRadar team.\nThe TechRadar hive mind.

        "raw_content": "September 12, 2023\nFujifilm Unveils Updated Development Roadmap of Interchangeable Lens Offerings for GFX System of Mirrorless Digital Cameras\nVALHALLA, N.Y. -\u00a0 FUJIFILM North America Corporation today revealed an updated interchangeable lens development roadmap for its GFX System of mirrorless digital cameras.

        "raw_content": "Most Popular\nCES 2024 Day 1: The 10 product reveals that impressed us most\nThe biggest week in tech is here: the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES). ZDNET has been both on the ground in Las Vegas and keeping a virtual eye on the latest products and concepts that debuted on the first day of the show.\nAlso:\u00a0CES 2024: What's Next in Tech\nSpecial Feature\nBest of CES 2024\nZDNET sorts through the wave of CES news and announcements to identify innovations that will make the most impact on professionals. Learn about the newest products and trends that transform the future of work and life.\nWhile much of what debuts at CES are conceptual products and devices like the hologram box we saw today or a multispectral camera for smartphones, many announcements include tech we can expect to buy and use in the coming months or year. It's what makes CES so exciting -- the promise of a high-tech future that will make our lives better and easier.\nToday, we saw announcements from big names like Samsung, Phillips, and HP, as well as new and innovative brands with cool concepts. We still have a few days to go, but so far, these are the things that impressed us the most on CES Day 1.\n1. Transparent TVs\nThe word of CES day 1 is \"transparent,\" thanks to two new transparent TVs from Samsung and LG. Samsung's Transparent MicroLED demo showed more of a vision of the future than a consumer TV product we can expect in our homes anytime soon. Still, Samsung presented its Transparent MicroLED displays in various form factors at its CES First Look experience, demonstrating how the modularity aspect allows buyers to custom fit the transparent displays to their liking.\nOn the flip side, LG debuted its OLED T TV that displays images over a transparent OLED panel, creating a fish tank-like effect. Despite its \"transparency,\" our ZDNET editors at CES described the contrast levels as what you've come to expect from LG's OLED panels.\n2. Roborock's new Q Revo series\nRoborock showed off its upcoming robot vacuums, including the Q Revo series. The Q Revo MaxV and Q Revo Pro are designed to deliver the same efficient cleaning performance as Roborock's flagship devices, but for a lower price. The two will include the new FlexiArm Design to help tackle edges and corners and will work alongside a 7000Pa suction to lift away all your home's dirt and debris.\nAlso: This one feature could revolutionize the way robot vacuums and mops work\nThe Multifunctional Dock 2.0 takes care of most of the dirty work for you, with automatic emptying, refilling, drying, and washing. The Q Revo series stands out, though, because it uses a hot water re-wash and re-mop setting that Roborock says will sanitize your floors.\n3. A mirror for your mental health\nBaracoda's BMind Smart Mirror combines AI and natural language processing (NLP) to analyze the sentiment of whoever is looking into the mirror through expressions, gestures, and tones. It then adapts to your current mood and provides light therapy sessions, guided meditations, and self-affirmations with the goal of improving your mood and better managing your stress.\nAlso: I chatted with a hologram at CES 2024, and it was as cool as it sounds\nIn a live demo at CES, the mirror responded to our ZDNET editor saying they were having a bad day by using encouraging words and switched the lights to a calming blue color while displaying an image of nature.\n4. Phillip's palm recognition smart lock\nCES always has lots of smart home tech debuts, and this smart lock from Phillips caught our attention on day 1. Much like the palm recognition technology you see in Amazon One stores, Phillips is now the first to include the technology in a consumer smart lock. The touchless technology scans the individual vein pattern in a person's palm by simply holding their palm a few inches in front of the lock's scanner. Users can add up to 50 different Palm ID options.\nAlso: Home Depot is adding more smart home gear with new Hubspace integrations\nThe smart lock uses Wi-Fi for connectivity, which means you don't have to buy a separate hub. Plus, it's also compatible with Amazon Alexa and Google Assistant.\n5. HP's AI-powered Spectre laptops\nOf course, a key theme we expect to see throughout CES this year is artificial intelligence, and HP didn't let us down with the release of its new Spectre laptops powered by AI. HP calls its AI assistant Superpower, and it can be customized to learn information about the user to generate text that contains more personal context than that created with other AI chatbots like\u00a0ChatGPT, for example.\nAlso: The best robots and AI innovations we've seen at CES 2024 so far\nDescribed by the company as the \"world's most adaptive laptop PCs with built-in AI technology,\" the Spectre x360 laptop PCs are triple engine machines with CPU, GPU, and NPU, which promises automatic performance optimization, with reduced fan noise and temperature based on open applications, the laptop's placement, and its battery status.\n6. TCL's massive QD mini LED TV\nAt an event like CES, bigger is better, and the QM89 TV from TCL is about as big as you can get. We spotted the 115-inch QD mini LED TV at CES and were impressed by not only its size, but also its 20,000 local dimming zones, an anti-glare screen to make sure you're able to watch TV no matter the conditions, and a 2.1.2 channel speaker system with built-in Dolby Atmos speakers.\nIt also has a 120Hz QLED display panel (144 Hz with VRR) and an anti-glare screen coating. TCL's built-in AIPQ Ultra Processor powers those 20,000 dimming zones and uses AI for improved upscaling and color reproduction, making it super sharp and clear in its picture.\n7. Sennheiser's earbuds that measure your heart rate\nSennheiser debuted three new earbuds at CES, but the one that caught our eye the most was the Sennheiser Momentum Sport. These earbuds are optimized for fitness thanks to their standout feature: a heart rate sensor and a body temperature sensor. Both sensors integrate with fitness trackers, apps, and subscriptions, like the Apple Watch and the Health app, Strava, and more, so you can seamlessly track your workouts and your fitness metrics.\n8. New AI features to come to Samsung's SmartThings app\nSamsung announced new updates and features to its SmartThings app during its press conference on day 1. The biggest of these features is Map View, a 3D layout of your home to make smart home devices easily accessible. The app will let anyone create a 3D map by uploading their home's floor plan or by simply sketching the floor plan on the app to create the layout.\nAlso: I saw Samsung's CES 2024 deluge of new TV tech and these 4 things impressed me most\nIn addition, SmartThings Together can enable members of a household or pre-approved guests to securely control specific smart home devices of your choosing and create their own routines. Compatible Samsung TVs will also be able to work as a SmartThings Hub, and nearby Samsung smartphones will be instantly detected and used as a remote control for the \"hub.\"\n9. A robot window cleaner that defies gravity\nWeird and unusual tech is the name of the game with CES, and this robot window cleaner is a great example of that. Piggybacking off of Ecovac's Winbot X that was launched in 2018, the Winbot W2 robot window cleaner attaches to windows like a robot vacuum for crystal clear windows without the elbow grease. It features three nozzles for a wide-angle spray that covers the cleaning area as it goes along, so that it doesn't drip onto your floors.\n10. An IMAX-enhanced projector\nIMAX isn't just for the theaters anymore, thanks to Xgimi's Horizon Max projector, the world's first IMAX Enhanced-certified long-throw smart projector. This projector has the infamous IMAX aspect ratio (1.44:1 or 1.9:1), higher brightness levels from HDR content, and clearer images to make your at-home movie nights that much better.\nAlso: Victrola's new turntable lets you stream vinyl to just about any device\nFor even more movie-theater quality, a proprietary optical engine equipped with MCL lasers -- which are commonly used in commercial movie theaters -- is also involved in this projector, which Xgimi says results in a truly cinematic viewing experience.\nRelated\nThe best 85-inch TVs for the ultimate home theater experience\nZDNET's guide to CES 2024: What is it, when is it, and who can attend?\nCES 2024: 3 trends to watch as we learn what's next in tech"

        "raw_content": "Fujifilm shows off camera-to-cloud features for X-H2 and X-H2S\nFujifilm has been demonstrating the camera-to-cloud feature of its X-H2 and X-H2S cameras at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) industry trade show in Las Vegas, Nevada. The feature, originally announced in October 2022, was added in recent firmware for the two cameras.\nX-H2 and X-H2S users with the FT-XH file transmitter grip are able to select and upload their stills or video footage directly into Frame.io, a widely-used video collaboration platform for distributed editing, review and revision of video projects.\nFujifilm's implementation allows photos as well as video to be directly uploaded from events, allowing remote editing while the photographer is still shooting. At the more stills-focused WPPI show in March, the company said the system: 'will help portrait, event, and wedding photographers save hours, and in some cases days, when it comes to editing and delivering images to their clients.'\nFrame.io was bought by Adobe in 2021 and has multiple subscription levels, depending on how many users will be collaborating and exactly what features they require. Having been developed independently, Frame.io has been designed to integrate with all the leading non-linear editors (NLEs) such as DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro and Avid Media Composer, as well as Adobe's own Premiere and After Effects software.\nThe Fujifilm cameras are the first stills cameras to offer direct integration with Frame.io.\nFujifilm Debuts New Products and Technology Solutions for Broadcast, Cinema, and Digital Content Creators at NAB 2023\nFUJINON Duvo HZK25-1000mmF2.8-5.0 CineBox PL Lens and newly launched Frame.io Camera to Cloud integrated workflow making their debuts onsite\nVALHALLA, N.Y., April 13, 2023 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c FUJIFILM North America Corporation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Electronic Imaging and Optical Devices Divisions will debut a variety of new gear and technology at the 2023 National Association of Broadcasters Show (NAB) from April 16 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c 19, 2023 in Las Vegas. Onsite at NAB will be the new FUJINON Duvo HZK25-1000mmF2.8-5.0 CineBox PL Lens (Duvo 25-1000) in addition to a full display of FUJINON cinema and broadcast lenses, and a full array of FUJIFILM X Series and GFX System digital cameras and lenses. As part of FUJIFILM X Series\u00e2\u20ac\u2122 presence onsite, attendees can also try out the newly launched firmware featuring Frame.io Camera to Cloud functionality onsite, using loaned FUJIFILM X-H2 (X-H2) and FUJIFILM X-H2S (X-H2S) mirrorless digital cameras.\n\"There is something special about being able to bring both our Electronic Imaging and Optical Devices Divisions, and the cutting-edge products they make, to the NAB Show floor,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Victor Ha, vice president, Electronic Imaging and Optical Devices Divisions, FUJIFLM North America Corporation. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s fun to see how the synergies between our X Series and GFX System mirrorless digital cameras and our FUJINON cinema/broadcast lenses are creating new conversations and opportunities for our customers to explore. This year, we\u00e2\u20ac\u2122re showcasing some of our latest offerings in an incredibly immersive way, and we can't wait to see the response.\"\nFUJINON Duvo HZK25-1000mmF2.8-5.0 CineBox PL Lens Makes its Debut\nA new category of lens, the development of which was first announced in October 2022, Duvo 25-1000 is a native PL-mount box lens that combines broadcast functionality with beautiful bokeh, delivering a cinematic look to live, as well as scripted, productions. Duvo 25-1000 utilizes innovative optical design technology to achieve a maximum aperture of F2.8 and 40x zoom ratio. This ultra-high zoom ratio lens is compatible with the large sensors of digital cinema cameras, yet provides a brightness of F2.8 at the wide angle. Not only does it enable filming in low-light environments such as indoor concerts or nighttime events, but the shallow depth of field creates the bokeh that delivers the highly sought-after cinematic look. At the April NAB Show, Duvo HZK25-1000mm will be shown on a Panasonic Connect AK- PLV100 in Super 35 cinematic with both traditional broadcast zoom and focus controllers. The popular Preston FIZ and Microforce Controllers will be shown, as well. An assortment of FUJINON UA Series box and portable broadcast lenses, and various FUJINON Premista, Cabrio and MK cinema lenses, will also be available to demo onsite:\nPer Fujifilm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s development roadmap for the Duvo Series of cinematic lens products, future cinematic lenses will consist of a standard zoom lens and a wide-angle zoom lens. Similar to the Duvo 25-1000, these lenses will be Dual Format, compatible with two types of large sensors. The lenses will be designed to support the Super 35 cinematic sensor and also be compatible with full-frame-equivalent image sensors with the use of a built-in 1.5x expander1.\nGet Hands-On with X-H2, X-H2S and Frame.io Camera to Cloud\nWith its firmware update including Frame.io Camera to Cloud functionality made officially available to the public today, Fujifilm is excited to share this groundbreaking integration with attendees at this year's NAB Show. Onsite, NAB Show attendees can get firsthand experience test-driving the highly anticipated integration for Frame.io by making images or video and watching them be delivered to Frame.io, directly from the originating X-H2S or X-H2 digital cameras. Within Frame.io, these images and video can be automatically edited, viewed online, or printed at Fujifilm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s NAB Show booth, literally within minutes.\nWith the Frame.io Camera to Cloud integration for the FUJIFILM X-H2S and X-H2 cameras,users with the FT-XH file transmitter accessory will have the ability to use their paid Adobe Creative Cloud subscriptions - and any active internet connection - to deliver any combination of still or video files to Frame.io, directly from the camera. This will accelerate production workflows and create opportunities to remotely collaborate in near real-time by providing centralized access to still and video assets as they are being created - even across multiple users.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153NAB is the perfect place to celebrate and demonstrate our new Frame.io Camera to Cloud functionality, because NAB attendees are so engaged and interested in the latest tech,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd said Ha. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153Having Frame.io Camera to Cloud technology in X-H2 and X-H2S will fundamentally change the way we make images and video because of how it simplifies collaboration and how it saves time for everyone involved.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nAdditionally, Fujifilm's onsite technical team will be conducting 30-minute, personalized demo sessions for attendees, featuring both cameras. Space is available on a first come, first served basis and may be reserved at the Fujifilm booth. Lastly, attendees can also take advantage of Fujifilm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s complimentary gear loan service to test out the latest FUJIFILM X Series and FUJIFILM GFX System cameras and lenses onsite (subject to availability and Fujifilm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standard equipment loan terms and conditions). Loans are limited to two-hours with a maximum of one camera and lens per person (available Sunday \u00e2\u20ac\u201c Tuesday, April 16-18, 2023, ONLY).\n1 Duvo 25-1000\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s built-in expander, for example, enables the expansion of the image circle and extension of focal lengths to the telephoto side. Further Duvo Series products are expected to have this same, unique functionality.\nGear in this story\nWhen you use DPReview links to buy products, the site may earn a commission.\nComments\nThis is also suitable for a 360 photo booth, the photos taken should be very clear\u00ef\u00bc\u0152\nWas not this site supposed to be shut down on 11th of April? Have I missed something?\nThis is the latest update\nAre it support free cloud-based storage service like Google Photo/Google Drive (free 15GB)?\nGoogle TV (which built-in in Sony/Panasonic/Sharp... smart TV) can direct display photo from Google Photo cloud-based service. It means camera can instant share to TV.\nWish Fujifilm release $99 M.2 SSD grip (similar to M.2 SSD closures, act as SSD heatsink too) which support direct record still photography/video into SSD.\nConsumer can purchase affordable M.2 SSD for highspeed shooting.\nwhy do we still hot have stills cameras that can upload to cloud services, so when i come home i just can start editing on ipad...\nAgree. Camera should built-in 5G eSIM which support instant upload to Google drive & iCloud.\nInstant edit via iPad, instant show in TV.\nDoes anyone think this feature release is a net-negative?\nIf Fuji spends scarce engineering resources (especially software) on this type of venture, it leaves less time & inclination to release something that doesn't require a subscription & internet access. (Btw, any revenue share w/ Adobe?)\nWhy can't we just get my pictures on an iPad in an instant?\nMy wife is an artist, and in my experience the creative impulse does not lend itself to the patience required of the manual importation process; and that delay between picture taken and review also hinders learning photography. So she uses an iPhone rather than $20k in camera equipment.\nImagine if we could take a picture, get an instant review on an tablet/phone/laptop (including applied RAW settings), then make a small modification to assess the impact of changed aperture, ISO, shutter, etc.\nNow image doing that without requiring anything more than local WLAN or Bluetooth!\nFuji is missing an opportunity. Modernize the experience.\nSo Fuji is banking on becoming the choice of the professionals? As a casual/amateur shooter, the cloud stuff just doesn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t appeal to me.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d rather stick to the long established FTP upload functionality in some cameras. Own infrastructure, no monthly fee and works with whatever workflow you envision afterwards. Without having to rely on a third party like Adobe.\nLike the FTP function built into this grip?\nThe grip uses ancient WiFi tech that doesn't decrease upload times.\nI'm not paying $1k for an updated Wifi spec when the newer chip is a few $.\nAlso, the advantage of a smaller APS-C camera is lost when having to put on a massive grip just to get marginally better functionality with no speed increase.\nThe grip is another attempt to monetize, and a poor one at that.\nI like this. A step we should have seen for some time. I get now why it has to be in the group not just the camera, uploading 3,000 RAWS would tax even a high end phone. I don't like the price too much. However, it does suggest a way of working I never considered which is photographer on the job and someone at home quickly turning the pics around for client. Even then link a device at the venue for the pics to slideshow when you are there. Though 1. I'd have to have someone who could do that! 2. I'd have to extend a lot of trust to the second person!\nAnd meanwhile, their phone app still sucks. Come on, Fujifilm. Fix it, FGS.\nHas DP Review (or any other trade mag interviewer) ever met with any software people with Fuji or other camera makers?\nHow many software developers at Fuji? What do they do?\nDP/LensRentals/etc does great work tearing down and analyzing cameras from the optics side, but who's talking about hardware and software development?\nComing from the PC world,\nI'm accustomed to seeing Phd level analysis of ATX PSUs/CPUs/SSDs and OS/SDK/Apps both from professional review sites and avid hobbyists.\nIn the web/embedded world there's even more.\nIn my experience, dedicated camera software is atrocious:\nFuji apps are kludgy, Canon's 3d app is inept, and even the 3rd party RAW editing software is too complicated for what it offers. I'm a dedicated nerd, but no wonder people use smartphones for pics.\nIf DP Review would have covered software & user experience in greater depth, perhaps they could have attracted reader and management interest towards improvements? As it is, cameras feel dead.\nI found Fujifilm Software Co.,Ltd with 14employees on LinkedIn!https://www.fujifilm.com/ffs/ja\nAlas, it is seemingly a healthcare related venture.\n(Be still beating hearts...)\nFWIW, healthcare software is also not the best user experience either.\nAnd then what happens if Adobe close down Frame.io, like Amazon closed down DPR?Will there be a firmware update to make it work with another site, or will you end up with a useless piece of camera kit?\nNot able to upload to the internet \u00e2\u2030\u00a0 useless. It'll still take pictures.\nThis is only one of the functions offered. If Frame.io, a platform widely used in the video production industry disappears, the other ftp and LAN options will still be available.\nNope. Make my own NAS/backups and the security as well reliability I can trust (save money too)\nSimply stupid idea to integrated any online service feature directly to camera.\nMake the camera have a SSH server, that's your direct access to it over any connection. And make it possible have wifi hotspot, so you can download instantly all wanted files from the card to phone, and from there to any online service you want or need, regardless do they go bankrupt or you want something else than what is offered by price.\nIt really shouldn't be so difficult, as these things are common sense since first Ethernet connection!\nThis is in addition to options such as ftp, LAN or connection to a phone. You don't have to use Frame.io by any means, but if access to a widely-use collaborative platform is useful, it's now an option.\nThe other brand that does this is RED, I believe: it's a platform that people and businesses use and find useful but you don't have to use it if it's not what you need.\nIt is irrelevant that it is an addition. It is just stupid to be there in the first place!\nWith the SSH you can run secure file transfer from camera to anywhere, be it intranet or internet or any other service all over the web.You don't need any firmware additions, no plugins, no modules, nothing else, as camera only task is to copy files over network connection (wired or wireless) to another location.\nWhat would really be benefit for all pro cameras, is just to have the camera connect to local hotspot (that can be even a laptop in the studio, room, tent etc) and then this way you can expose camera memory card directly to other computers you want to offer the access behind password. Automatic upload from card to other directory in network and that is all that is needed.\nYou can keep shooting as much you like, and camera copy files at background as host, or works as a client to example laptop that downloads them from camera on its own storage device, or just shows the thumbnails.\nFujiFilm should hire you as their lead R&D.\nlol\nOk, so companies shouldn't make it easier to use popular platforms used by the industry because you've had a better idea. Got it.\n\"FujiFilm should hire you as their lead R&D. lol\"\nWhy you couldn't resist to make personal insults? What is wrong with you?\n\"Ok, so companies shouldn't make it easier to use popular platforms used by the industry because you've had a better idea. Got it.\"\nYou clearly couldn't either avoid personal insults. I expected more from you. I don't anymore.\nIf you can not understand that it is stupid for the company to tie their HARDWARE that stops receiving SOFTWARE UPDATES very quickly after releases (you can still go out and shoot with anything that Canon, Nikon etc has ever produced with digital cameras, with all features working), to a THIRD PARTY ONLINE SERVICE, then I don't know what is your problem exactly.\nDo you understand why people dislike the subscription software licensing? Where you are forced to pay monthly or annually for someone to have access to the software they have purchased in the first place?The concept that is not even \"Hey, I just went to rent a camera/lens, and after week I returned it\" but \"I just rented the camera, but after rent period I can't access my files anymore\".\nAnd if you can't understand how easy it is to have just a standard SSH server/client capability in the hardware (FTP is not such security risk for the purpose of the camera memory card access), as you can use that to get direct access as well to all those online services you want, without any of them being directly in the hardware, then you should really focus more about how the computers works at the background. SSH would allow you to even have your camera connecting directly to any your wanted online service, and upload files there without any third party hardware restrictions or limitations to specific service.\nWhat I am talking about is identical to a standard memory card interface, so you can buy any brand for type and insert it to camera for use, instead having a third party slot and their own unique interface leaving the camera owner restricted to what they can get in the camera. Littlebit like what Olympux tried with their xD cards that denied panorama on non-olympus cards.\nHow do you know that Adobe didn't invest money with Fujifilm to make this product as a joint solution? Also creating a ssh scenario is always going to be a low level solution. The idea of customers using adobe or whatever is usually because those companies guarantee service if things go wrong. They don't want to trouble shoot any issues. That's why companies sometimes buy products and services from Oracle or MS rather than roll their own or use Open source. They want the warranty and SLA's you get from those services.Finally, frame.io integrates with all the services most clients need. There's going have to be software installed on whatever server you set up to receive the files to make the hop and connect with frame.io API's. Fuji/Adobe are just doing that for you.\nWhen you buy this product you're betting on Adobe to supply your solution. It's a big company. That's enough for most people who are already in bed with Adobe anyway.\nSo I don't get all the beef here. It is what it is.\nI\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m going to miss the comments section.\nMk82 - I wasn't making a personal insult, I was trivialising your argument (not you, personally).\nI completely understand the resistance to subscriptions for software but this isn't quite that: it's a subscription for use of an online collaboration platform, where there are ongoing cost for hosting and making your content available to other collaborators. It's more akin to having to pay a subscription for your cell/mobile phone or ISP. And once your project is complete, you can stop subscribing because you no longer need to share and work collaboratively on it.\nPersonally I see it as making a lot more sense for Fujifilm to conclude that they couldn't easily make and maintain in in-house knock-off of Frame.io and that some people would find it useful to use an already stable, established platform that's proven itself in the video production industry.\nBut ultimately, if a remote collaborative workflow system isn't what you need, you can just ignore it: the Transfer grip does pretty much everything the Canon WFT add-on transmitter units do, so far as I can tell, such as (s)ftp.\nI'm sure SSH would be lovely and I understand your frustration that camera makers aren't offering it, but that doesn't mean that offering the option of using a popular, established, robust platform is a bad thing, for those that want it.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 And if you can't understand how easy it is to have just a standard SSH server/client capability in the hardware\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nDammit Jim, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122m a photographer not an IT wonk.\n(Not strictly true in my case, but I see the use case for solutions abstracted from the bare metal.)\nRichard Butler is perhaps not fully versed in the networking stack and the associated software services that can be built thereon.\nFuji and Adobe will devote resources to this proprietary and non-robust solution.\nAnd this allocation of resources will be to the detriment of better approaches.\nFrame.io is a marketing driven solution, not a balanced engineering solution.\nWhy Fuji ties themselves to Adobe before they create other more open solutions is beyond me...but it may have to do with upfront $.\nPersonally I would not want any type of a server endpoint running on my camera. There are vast superior methods of pushing data out of an IoT these days.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153 Fuji and Adobe will devote resources to this proprietary and non-robust solution. And this allocation of resources will be to the detriment of better approaches.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nIn the meantime, production teams leveraging frame.io can get sh_t done. So there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s that. Sometimes perfect is the enemy. Done is good. Done is happy. Get things done.\nHello Nikon, are you listening?\nNot if Mk82 is their lead R&D guy, lol\nThere is already FTP upload available, which is a much better solution. And they do have NX Mobile Air for using your smartphone in between, in case you don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t have the network grip for the Z6II/Z7II.\n@CyborgKitty\"Not if Mk82 is their lead R&D guy, lol\"\nAmazing how someone can be so ignorant, and yet resolt only to personal insults because can't understand a technical facts explained to him.\nYou are exactly the person who deserves that when gear fails, you need to buy a new one because you don't understand reason to repair stuff. And you don't even understand what is the benefit to have a ILC in the first place instead a fixed lens to body. And you don't even understand that what is the benefit that when the manufacturer goes under, or even more likely, the partner of the manufacturer goes under, or that there comes a new better option available on the market, that you don't need to buy everything again because you can adapt the existing equipment for the new market situation without someone telling you \"You can't!\".\nGood that you are never in any situation to be leading anyone, as you don't understand a thing even if it would be twisted to you with a train track.\nSo Fujifilm can now do what. phones have been able to do for decades. Great work camera industry.\nIt took decades for phones to do what even compact cameras could do. Great job phone industry.\nWhat happened to the video?\nIt was uploaded to the wrong cloud service.\nI recently bought a H2s and compared to my previous Sony cameras, I like it but it has tooooooooooooooooons of bugs, both small and big, as well as missing features that seem just weird for a camera of this calibre.People complain about Sony meny (I'm talking about the older one), but is a milion times better than Fuji.\nI like the fact that it's a stacked sensor, fast speed camera that takes CFExpress Type B cards, but if it wasn't for that, I would've dumped it.\nFuji start working on software that actually matters instead of niche features like cloud upload!\nDid you update to the latest firmware? It makes a big difference. The camera has matured.As for the menus, being used to Sony, it's normal that you will need some time to become familiar with something different. Me being a long time Fuji user, I would probably hate the Sony menus as much as you hate the Fuji's.\nYeah it's the latest firmware. Unfortuantely the software is quite buggy, for example my lcd screen info resets from time to time, S-mode shows the screen bright but photos turn out dark (I made a long thread in Fuji X forum about it, it's just a missing feature) and the meny makes very little sense.\nSo this is simply an FTP preset for an external $1000 accessory? So the whole premise about camera and not a\nFT-XH being integrated is a lie, kinda?\nBut why, Fuji? For what purpose?\nI'm not sure your point. The built in wifi and antenna probably aren't sufficient to transmit high res Raws and video so you need the grip. Besides, can you imagine how quickly you would deplete your camera battery without the grip.\nA camera body is a very big device compared to a smartphone and many other embedded devices, so the grip should not be necessary for incorporating an adequate antenna.\nI don't understand why you would need the File transmitter grip for that?\nYes, Ethernet is not on the body itself unlike with other brands, but both WiFi and USB-C are. And that USB-C to ethernet adapters are viable is already shown by other brands.\nSo why the upsell on the grip?Also why just select and upload? Why no background transfer?\nWhere did you read no background transfer? I don't even have the grip and I can do background transfer to my computer...I think the \"select thing\" is that you can select what \"stream\" of movie is going to the cloud. They recommend the proxies, of course, because bandwidth. The huge high quality ProRes files staying on the memory card for use at render time.\n\"Welcome to the cloud revolution\". It is 2023 people, iCloud launched 12 years ago. It is more remarkable that wireless connectivity hasn't been included as a standard feature in these kinds of cameras for some time already - without any attachments needed.\nAs far as I am aware Fuji bodies have Wifi\nAlso, other companies just allow transfer over Wifi, Ethernet or USB-C (to ethernet)\nFuji just needs a reason to sell the grip it seems\nWifi yes, but seemless upload to the cloud while operating is what has been around for a decade and would hardly qualify as a \"revolution\" I'd think.\nIt's become child's play for phone companies, but a revolution for a camera company like Fuji.\nWell, the pro cameras from all major brands have FTP upload functionality, which can easily be hooked into all kinds of clouds. It is not super consumer friendly but it is not new. So on the pro side, this functionality always existed.\n@Tango. To be fair, optical zooms have been childs' play for compact cameras for half a century or more, but they are considered a revolution in phones.\nGetting there.How about connectivity and security features for these higher-end cameras.\nNow if they could just make the app seamlessly upload.. to my phone or tablet.\nI just skipped through the body of text, is this a way to constantly draw funds from fuji users (via cloud subscription)?\nNot unless you need the service that it offers.\nBut if you know of a robust collaborative platform used by professionals that doesn't entail fees, by all means post details.\nOur business uses Google Photos.\nIt's free and it's quite good.We used it to share albums with clients, they can add comments, they're notified of additional images/video as we populate the album etc.\nThe images can be uploaded by PC, Mac, Android device etc.\nFree, regardless of you have a Google product or not.\nReally fantastic.\nDropbox Replay (still in Beta as I know) has the same functionality without any additional fee. Frame.io offered (a couple of years ago at least) 2GB with free plan. It's ridiculously small for any real project but enough to get acquinted with the workflow. Meanwhile you can get up to 15GB on Dropbox (with some tricks though), but I never noticed if Dropbox Replay eats some of this available space. It allows 4K video uploads and have integration [at least] with DaVinci Resolve (I have no idea about other NLEs).\nBut my personal advise for small(?) video teams would be Blackmagic Cloud Store without any subscription fee and syncing over Dropbox and Google Drive:\nhttps://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/blackmagiccloudstore\nBTW you can use DaVinci Network libraries for collaboration without any fees and use DaVinci Cloud libraries for real time team work on a project for $5/month for one library (it can contain unlimited number of projects). You can add or delete libraries at any time (so only you decide how much and how long you need paid options) and your Cloud ID won't suffer, because it's free by default, you pay only for Cloud libraries. The integrity and capabilities of DaVinci Cloud are a way beyond what Frame.io has to offer.\nSurprisingly, I have to update my previous comment because today, after years of being in Beta stage, Replay is out of Beta. Now it offers something identical to Frame.io but with Dropbox integration:\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/replay\nConcerning DaVinci Resolve from Blackmagic Design, one week ago they introduced DaVinci Resolve 18.5 Public Beta with new feature called Presentations. This feature does exactly the same as Frame.io.There is no any information about fees and as far as I can see right now it's currently free of any charge in its Beta. And AFAIK the Blackmagic design politics if it will have some fee, it will be way less expensive than competitives or it possibly remain free of charge.All about Blackmagic DaVinci Resolve collaboration features:\nhttps://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/collaboration\nThanks for that info, Blackmagic yet again providing amazing products at very reasonable prices.\nAlways love the support Fuji show to their cameras and greatly support the staff of dpreview.\nHow one can love a company for their support, after they have sold a bugged and missing features, that are required to be waited to be fixed and implemented (if at all) in coming years?\nHow about getting the product out with features, and then IF they're is s bug, get it fixed as soon as it is reported to company?\nThat is Fuji Kaizen... Like example X-T1 was shipped with a Fn button that didn't work, you couldn't use it to anything. You needed to wait couple months to get a firmware update that added possibility to bind the function to that button.And people go \"I love you Fuji, everyone should be like you!\" with completely ignorant to major flaws in their products software.\nYou may also like\nMore about gear in this article\nThis year, plenty of amazing cameras, lenses, accessories and other products came through our doors.

For the first time in North America, Fujifilm will be showcasing four key new technologies in its market-leading REVORIA PRESS toner-based product line.\n\u201cWe\u2019re especially excited to share our expanded product portfolio with our customers at the PRINTING United Expo 2023,\u201d said Hidetoshi \u201cToshi\u201d Kino, General Manager, FUJIFILM North America Corporation, Graphic Communication Division. \u201cThis year, we have chosen to exhibit all our solutions from each segment of print, showing the total solution Fujifilm provides to our customers. As you will see, the spirit of Never Stop is very strong at Fujifilm. We Never Stop listening to our customers, addressing challenges and together, we Never Stop developing the next generation of print solutions.\u201d\nTo celebrate the advancements of the REVORIA PRESS series, a sneak peek of REVORIA PRESS GC12500, the market\u2019s first B2 size, cut-sheet digital press using dry toner technology, will be presented onsite at Fujifilm\u2019s booth B2506. With the J PRESS 750HS already leading the professional, level high quality and high productivity transition from offset to digital, Fujifilm has turned its attention to making B2 size printing easy and efficient in order to develop new markets including the high-production quick printer segment. REVORIA PRESS GC12500 can print double sided on a maximum paper size of 26 x 29.5 inches, the largest in the industry. GC12500 can print six pages per sheet, in A4 or letter size and can handle a variety of paper weights, from 64 to 450 gsm. Additionally, Fujifilm has dramatically shortened a typical work line by consolidating the feeder, stacker, and control panel on one side for the press operator.\nBuilding off the launch of the REVORIA PRESS PC1120, 6 color inline press and the E-1 Series Monochrome press earlier this year, Fujifilm\u2019s North American toner-based product lineup will also now include the REVORIA PRESS\u2122 EC1100, SC180, and APEOSPRO C810 models, all of which will be available for view onsite at Booth B2506.\nAPEOSPRO C810 also benefits from the first high-resolution (2400 x 2400 dpi) LED printhead, which creates a high-definition print from a very thin LED beam. The exposure unit produces very little vibration because there is no drive mechanism, meaning image reproduction is incredibly stable, and the LED printhead itself consumes very low levels of energy, which translates to low operating costs. APEOSPRO C810 also benefits from the use of Fujifilm\u2019s Super EA-Eco toner. In combination, the Super EA-Eco toner and LED printheads produce ultra-smooth gradations, and vibrant colors, and the combination of those products facilitate the reproduction of images with very fine lines and text. An additional \u2018gloss\u2019 function brings a beautiful sheen to print.\nThe entire REVORIA PRESS product line provides customers a wide variety of finishing options, including punch, staple, saddle staple, single fold, Z-fold half sheet/tri-fold, crease, face trim, full bleed trim, and square back.\nFujifilm\u2019s booth at the PRINTING United Expo 2023 will also feature live production and demonstrations of the company\u2019s popular UV inkjet wide format presses, including the Acuity Ultra R2 and Acuity Ultra Hybrid LED, and the 2023 Pinnacle award-winning J PRESS 750HS, and in collaboration with FUJIFILM DIMATIX division, live demonstration of inkjet print bar solutions.\nThe entire Fujifilm booth will be utilizing Fujifilm\u2019s ColorPath SYNC color management technology to characterize, profile, and ensure accuracy across devices and to industry standard printing conditions.\nFujifilm\u2019s booth B2506 will also feature dedicated product zones and application displays staffed with subject matter experts for print segments including commercial print, analog and digital packaging. In addition, for the first time, Fujifilm\u2019s booth B2506 will feature a \u201cPhoto Zone\u201d in partnership with Fujifilm\u2019s Imaging Division.

Updating the older XF 10-24mm, the new lens keeps the optics unchanged, but adds weather-resistance, improved optical image stabilization and a physical aperture ring.\nCovering an equivalent focal length range of 15-36mm in full-frame terms, the XF 10-24mm F4 R OIS WR is a high-quality wide-angle option for Fujifilm X-series shooters. Now featuring weather-resistance, the new lens should be a better companion for the similarly tough X-T4 and X-T3.\nDespite the sealing, the new lens is very slightly lighter than its predecessor (by 25g / 0.9oz) and optical image stabilization has been improved by one stop, bringing the total stabilizing effect to a rated 3.5EV (CIPA). When combined with the in-camera IBIS system of the X-T4, total stabilization increases to 6.5EV.\nThe new lens will be available next month, for an MSRP of $999.95 USD.\nPress release:\nFujifilm Introduces FUJINON XF10-24mmF4 R OIS WR lens\nNewly updated, ultra-wide angle zoom lens features weather-resistance and more\nValhalla, N.Y., October 15, 2020 \u00e2\u20ac\u201c FUJIFILM North America Corporation is pleased to announce the launch of the FUJINON XF10-24mmF4 R OIS WR Lens, the 36th interchangeable lens designed for Fujifilm\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s X Series digital camera system.

Having the updated OIS and weather sealing is what made me take the plunge. I am up in the mountains in Colorado and I am wondering if anyone out there has some guidance as far as filters... something to keep on there for everyday hiking around and then one VND to pop on and use with the tri-pod for motion blur, sunsets etc.... The VND I was looking at is the Urth nd8-128 offers (3-7 stops). As for CPLs is that event a think I should look at for this lens or is it too wide?\nI think it would turn more heads and get more interest in Fuji's system if they did something more like the Panasonic 10-25mm f1.8 m43 ($1400) or the Panasonic 20-50mm f3.5-f5.6 FF ($600) lenses. Split the difference and you'd get something like 14-35mm f2.8 at $999 and I think that'd be a real winner.\nNot comparable, both options you mention give 20mm equivalent focal length, whereas this lens is 15mm equivalent. That is significantly more wide angle.\nRight Johann3s. This lens is not what I think they're missing which was the entire point of my comment: To describe the type of lens they're missing they could have made instead of this.\nDoes it look to anyone else like the new 10-24 falls under the \"red badge zoom\" category on the updated roadmap?\nAbout time, it has always been a flawed design. I owned it and the mount broke very easily, had to be repaired by Fuji. Every time I pointed out how unsharp the edges are at 10mm, or how the flawed IS system is just as likely to add blur as to avoid it, the fanboys screamed in denial. Pretty pathetic to be honest. Now Fuji themselves decided it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not good enough, and interestingly the IS system is mentioned specifically.\nOK, yes, wow! Fuji now has an UWA zoom that is optically good, not gigantic, is stabilized *and* weathersealed, and which comes at a price that I could imagine myself being willing to pay! I've been eyeing Fuji for a long time as my next system, and the lack of this lens has been one of the main reasons why I wasn't happy with my options. I want something for landscape photography that I can take into the backcountry. That means something that's weathersealed, not too heavy, and which offers a range of focal lengths from ultra-wide to wide-normal. This is perfect! The 8-16mm 2.8 is a wonderful lens, but it's bulky and heavy, very expensive, and I just don't need f/2.8 for what I want to do. This new version of the 10-24mm f/4 would suit me down to the ground.\nNot to mention, the 8-16mm has a horrible fixed lens hood/massive front element which precludes the use of circular filters. As a backcountry landscape photography myself, I like to keep the systems simple and light so I prefer a good circular filter. The new 10-24 has me drooling. I've been working with the 12mm rokinon (excellent lens btw) and the 18-55 kit, but mMAN do I not enjoy having to switch lenses in the backcountry to go ultrawide. I was already looking at the 10-24. Curse fuji for now making me decide between this sexy new weather sealed update and the now-much-cheaper original 10-24.\nIt looks like Fujifilm is paying attention to customer requests, good stuff!\nMuch like the APSC Sony 10-18mm F4, this lens is a really rough value proposition.\nThis would be an 15-36 F6 on full frame but costs more than the Tamron 17-28mm F2.8, which is excellent.\nExcept that that Tamron lens is not available for Fuji camera's, so I think if you have a fuji camera and want a 10-24mm lens this is still a good value proposition ;).\nIf the only grocery with toilet paper in stock is selling it for $50 per roll, it doesn't mean that $50 for a roll is a \"good value.\"\nIt just means that you're going to be overcharged if you want toilet paper right now.\nThat comparison is only valid if the Tamron lens would be like 10 bucks\nThe principle is the same, regardless of your only option being 100x more expensive or merely 3-4x as expensive.\nRealistically a Tamron 15-36mm F6 would be quite cheap, likely $400 or less. But there's no market for such a lens to even find out.\nHow would this lens compare optically to a Fuji red badge lens? Looks a pretty good option, I already have the 16mm F1.4 Fuji lens.\nI don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t know about comparing but the mk1 is very good, it won\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t match that prime but realistically we shouldn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t expect it to.\nThe 10-24mm F/4,\nMark I, for what it is, produces wonderful images and is a very good value when on sale.\nThe wide end is not perfect, but good. It probably won't equal your 16mm at 16mm.\nOverall it is an excellent lens for landscapes.\nThe lack of weather resistance in a landscape lens such at the Mark I was an oversight by Fuji and the landscape photographers let Fuji know this.\nThe 8-16mm f/2.8 with the red badge and weather resistance, came later. It is wider and better optically at the ranges that overlap the 10-24mm. Many people feel it isn't worth the extra bucks to upgrade for the extra 2mm, better optics on the wide end and an extra stop.\nFor interiors, the extra stop has value.\nFor landscapes, probably not.\nIt is a matter of personal preference and what you shoot.\nThe 10-24mm Mark I is a terrific package in terms of size, range, optics and price.\nThe upgrades in the Mark II will make it even better.\n@Txoni--Yes, the 10-24mm is far more flexible than the\n8-16mm, particularly on the trail.\nThe 24mm on the long end does overlap the short end of the 16-55mm or the 18-55 and this is a good thing. It also reduces lens changes.\nFewer lens changes on the trail--always to\nthing given moisture or dust on the trail.\nThis is a big plus with this lens--it is actually covers a useful range for landscapes.\nThe size and weight of the 8-16mm is a consideration--let's face it how many times do we really need 8mm? on the trail?\nEverything I've read says that the 10-24mm is optically quite good, but the 8-16mm is better. The 8-16 is also much larger, heavier, and more expensive. It does offer a 12mm equivalent wide end, but some photographers might find more value in the 35mm equivalent long end of the 10-24, since its 15mm wide end is still quite wide. Also of course the 8-16 will give you f/2.8, but if you're shooting landscapes where you usually want deep depth of field anyway, that may not be worth the weight and size penalty.\nIgnoring price for a moment, there are pros and cons to both options and what's best for you depends on what your priorities are. However, the 8-16 also costs 50% more.\nOh, and of course the 10-24mm is stabilized whereas the 8-16mm is not. That may not matter too much with these UWA lenses (especially on newer Fuji bodies with IBIS) but it does help compensate somewhat for the slower maximum aperture.\nAllowing one to leave the tripod at home when hiking or doing the tourist thing, is really what a modern image stability system should enable.\nThe OIS on 10-24mm Mark I is okay but it is not the equal of IBIS on say an Olympus E-M1 Mark II camera which is very good and even better when paired with a 12-100mm lens with OIS.\nOne of the best travel kits made in terms of size, quality and capability (IMHO).\nSome find the kit pricey--yes, it is a bit, but it is really nice.\nOf course, the 12-100mm lens is not as wide as the 10-24mm, but its capabilities are what we are discussing.\nI do not have an X-T4 but I have read, Fuji did a nice job with the new system and it is now competitive with other makers.\nUpgrading the OIS on the 10-24mm mark II is the next step. Being able to leave the tripod at home when hiking or perhaps visiting a church or cathedral is the point.\nThe current Mark I version is fine for what it is, but not really state of the art.\nThe 8-16 can\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t take filters easily either, I\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d love to own it though... but the money is better spent on the 80mm macro in my case as the 10-24 does everything I need.\nThe zoom figures on the lens go from 10, 14,2018 and 24. What does the 2018 mean?\nLOL. I'm seeing 24, 20, 18, 14, 10\nThey go \"24 2018 14 10\", or if we add some more space: \"24 20 18 14 10\"\nI have the 10-24 f4 and it's a great lens but why they didn't do 2.8 version ?????\nThey would have to put a pod inide the box...\nSize!\nThey do an 8-16mm f/2.8 if you want that. It's excellent, albeit heavier and more expensive. This is for people who want something smaller, lighter, and cheaper and who don't need f/2.8. The 10-24mm is probably the better choice for most people. If you're shooting traditional landscape photography you normally use fairly narrow apertures anyway, so f/2.8 is not much of a benefit. You may spend a lot of time trekking to and from your shooting location though, in which case a lighter kit is very nice.\nBig day for FUJIFILM\nI have the first edition of this lens. I bought it a year ago, but it hasn't seem as much action as my other UWAs (Olympus 7-14mm and Nikon 16-35mm) had in the same period. COVID aside, it is partly due to the lack of WR and partly due to the fact that I found it to be a bit too soft in the corners. Maybe I have a bad copy - it was bought used. In any case, I will be interested in 2-3 years from now to upgrade for the WR.\nThe 1st edition of this lens is a favourite of mine when working with my X-T3 in a small space, or for a super-wideangle landscape. Great for video and Image Stabilization compliments the X-T3's lack of IBIS. I never had any problems with focusing and image quality/geometry, so this new version is surely recommended for its added Weather Resistance, as well as, a more effective IS system. Can't go wrong with this if you are after a super wideangle lens for your Fujifilm!\nI noticed that when shooting at 10mm the OIS isn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t fantastic and the camera selects when in aperture priority about 1/15th SS sometimes in dusk, but 1/80 is much sharper. This type of SS was easy to achieve with my Canon 10-18 IS. I love the lens optically and much prefer it to the canon offering, but not impressed with the OIS to be honest.\nSince I primarily use the IS for video shooting I did not notice this... Usually shutter speed is set to 1/50th for 25fps and 4K video seems critically focused.\nThis is the lens I been waiting for my since my X-E2 and recently X-H1, but maybe a little too late with Canon, Nikon, Sigma and Panasonic FF choices now being so very good.\nThis lens should have been WR from the very start, along with their WR cameras in the X-T series, but I am glad they got around to it anyway.\nBetter late than never, though.\nThe aperture ring is also a bonus!\nReasonable upgrade for a landscape photographers' workhorse.\nThis is exactly what I was looking for when I considered moving from m43 to Fuji because this would be the only lens I would use, and picking up a used X-T3 would be an amazing combination.\nThat ship has sailed for me however this was something I would hope Fuji would do.\nI loved my small 9-18 Oly mounted on the PEN F.\nI have done this move (m4/3 to Fuji). Don't expect an upgrade in picture quality, but I do love Fuji more.The files are, in my opinion, less \"clinical sharp\" but have a more distinct character to them. Out of the camera, they are simply amazing. Even in post-processing, they are much easier to work with than Oly's.\nThis is interesting to hear, after the continual stream of \"Fuji should\nget rid of X-Trans because it's so tough to process\" complaints on the forums.\nI haven't run into any notable difficulties with either format, myself.\n(I shoot both Fuji and Oly).\nWhat about the Oly files is tougher to work with in your experience?\n@Mr BoltonIn my understanding, third-party software was not up to the task when the first-gen of X-Trans sensor came out. We have come a long way since. Particularly with Capture One (both the free-for-fuji Express and the cheap-ish Pro version) does an excellent job.I found Olympus' files harder (in comparison to Fuji) for two reasons:1) Fuji RAW files, when opened on Capture One, come with the film simulation preselected. This gives you a nice overview of how the photo can look like (even at the time of shooting) and then you only need to do minimum adjustments - or you can switch to another film simulation at any point. Olympus RAW files are -in comparison- flat. You need to fiddle a great deal more to get pleasing colours or replicate something like 'Chrome' film simulation - Olympus JPEG engine is great but nowhere as good as Fuji's. Sure, you can use a preset or a LUT to get similar results with the Fuji. However, it feels like you have to do that something extra to get there.\nEven if that something extra is just one button, it is still an extra step. Plus, you can't \"preview\" the preset/LUT at the time of the shooting. This makes me second-guess any editing and spend more time trying out different looks.\n2) Fuji stores an amazing amount of details in its files. Olympus is not much behind, but it does have a preference to keep shadow details over highlights (at least in my experience, I have not done a side-by-side comparison). Fuji stores a good deal of information for both. Further, Olympus prioritizes keeping details over noise reduction. This gives you so much noise. I always had to use NR with my Olympus when pulling up shadow details. Never with the Fuji.\nAhh, this makes sense.\nAs a Linux user I can't get C1, but have other excellent options available.\nI would argue that keeping the details is most important because noise can be brought down but details cannot be brought back.. but I am not a pro so in reality it doesn't matter that much for me as long as the finished output looks good.\nI got some really amazing pictures out of Olympus' color presets and filter/scene modes.\nBut they are different than Fuji's 'advanced' shooting filters.\nI decided to not spend too much time trying to make one look like the other, each has its own merits.\nClassic Chrome film sim sells a lot of Fuji cameras, for sure.\nBut the Olympus 'dramatic tone' art filter has no equal on the Fuji-although they try with their 'dynamic tone' filter, it doesn't look as good.\nThank you for the well reasoned explanation.\n@Mr Bolton If you dial down noise, you still loose details. It is simply a \"pick your poison situation.\" I personally think that any modern 20mpxl (or more) camera gives you more than enough details. Even FIAP competitions are still at 1080p and 4K viewing!\nFor me, the biggest benefit of the Fujifilm's simulation is that I can see them at the time of shooting. It simply makes it easier to envision how I want the final shot to look and I have a \"head start\" at the post-process, saving some time.\nOlympus' color presets are not bad and the filters do get criticism quite unfairly. I like Olympus' dramatic tone. It is a good way to get a \"one-shot pseudo-HDR\" shot. The best way to replicate it (with Fuji or any other camera) is by using Photomatix HDR software. Still, as I shoot RAW, the filters do little good as they are not stored in the RAW files. This means that I had to use Olympus' editor, if I wanted to play around with them, adding another step/ software in the pipeline. 1/2\nFuji stores all of film simulation data in the RAW files. You can switch between them even from Capture One and Lightroom. It is small things like that, whcih for me made a huge difference at the end of the day.\nI need to be clear, Olympus' colours are great - except green, I never liked how Olympus render grass.\nAnyhow, I am glad you liked my answer! I really think that we are not only splitting hair now, that most of the differences between systems are down to personal preferences. Usability is far more important than tech specs, as any system can give you good enough results... 2/2\nI didn't know that Fuji raws stored all the film sim data within.\nWill have to investigate how to access this within Darktable, if it is possible.\nAlso agreed, the system you most enjoy using is generally the one you should pick.\nUnless you need a certain parameter that your favorite system doesn't have..\nsuch as the 100mp resolution of GFX 100.\nYou may need it for professional use, but prefer carrying a little E-M5 for travel because it's so much smaller, lighter, more agile.\nThis is Pentax tactics: Just update with WR and newer coatings, sell it as new and keep the price the same.Actually I liked what they did, keeping the price low.\nSo, what's bad about getting an improved lens for the same price?\nFurthermore you'll probably get some good deals on the old one now.\nToni, did I say it is bad? Read again what I said.\nYour right. I misunderstood.\nAccepting one's mistake is a rare virtue at this forum. I salute you (I am serious).\nTo be honest I get exact same impression like Toni from my first reading of your post. Strange thing. :)\nHi next user, thanks you. :-)\nPana had been doing something similar with a bunch of zooms, adding weather sealing and improving the AF/OIS mechanics (no new aperture rings tho, would've been awesome on the PL25)... I think in a lot of cases it's a very welcome move by existing users, I didn't even know Fuji's UWA wasn't sealed, that seems like a bad omission they've now corrected.\nTime to update 35 and 23mm f1.4 too\nI can't believe it uses the same optics as the previous model! All I need do to save myself a grand is wrap a plastic bag round it in the rain.\nI would have bought one if they'd promised it sharper at 24mm...\nFormula has same # Elements, same # of Groups, but has 4 ED elements instead of 3. So we'll have to wait to see what the comparison is, instead of guessing. Might be the same, who knows. As mentioned in another comment.\nFYI I was incorrect.\nIt says in the press release they've stuck to the same optical formula, it's pretty good though and my favourite lens.\nInteresting update. The original version is a lens I use a lot and provides excellent image quality, so optics remaining unchanged not a big deal it did not need updating really. Improvements what one might expect but not essential. If you do not own the 10-24 then it is a great lens, but if you dot not need Weather sealing pick up a secondhand original and use the saved cash on another lens. The new price is a little lower than the original.\nIf optics are the same, I am looking forward to good prices on the old one to snatch one!\nWish they\u00e2\u20ac\u2122d next update the 16-80 so that it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sharp from corner to corner throughout its zoom range.\nwell, they only released it like last year, didn't they?\nMy copy of the 16-80 suits me to a tee. It's one of my favourite picks on the H1.\nThe combo puts me in mind of my\nContax RTSIII 35-135mm That was my mainstay in an earlier photographic life.\nI'm more than happy.\nAh well Horses for courses. (smile).\nAnd sharp at the long end would have meant I kept mine.\n@pamelamotown I miss my RTS III, what a tank.\n@larkhon yes, and it's performance has been a disappointment to many.\n@JOrmsby: I know... my 18-55mm isn't that good at 18mm but the 16-80mm I had was even worse at 16mm. Thing is, 16mm is probably going to be 60-70% of shots taken with that lens. If it is not good enough, there's no point keeping the lens...\nThis is what Fuji really have to work on. My first 18-55 was OK but the replacement (breakage) is outstanding. My 16-80 was blindingly good up to 55mm but very soft thereafter - it got returned.\nOn the subject, I had a 55-200mm that was optically one of the best lenses I ever used but sent it back because of a manufacturing defect. The replacement was simply OK but really nothing special.\nHow hard is it to get some sort of consistency going here?\nIt's hard, doing actual and thorough QC at the end of assembly would raise costs a lot and unfortunately a ton of people never test their samples critically so I don't think it's something manufacturers wanna bother with... It's not just Fuji, it's virtually everyone AFAIK, outside of a few high end Zeiss/Leica lines and maybe some Sigmas. From what I've read most manufacturers just do optical QC along the process (checking elements are bonded and sanded correctly, etc) and all most do at the end is a simple check to make the lens is working.\n(cont.)\nGiven all that, it's actually kind of impressive how consistent most manufacturers are with most lenses TBH (there's plenty of offending outliers mind you), tho that isn't of much solace to those of us who get a bum sample... It's particularly irritating since CS will often not admit it and turn it back as \"within tolerances\" or whatever, so then the onus is in the buyer to return it if still within that window. A lot of smaller mirrorless lenses aren't even easily adjusted, so broad QC would just find rejects that go to the trash heap.\nIt's easy to guess why the bean counters would rather keep lower costs, lower prices, and the status quo.\nFuji are the only manufacturer I've had QC problems with. Are they all like this. I can count a litany of frustration that makes me reluctant to buy any more. But the forthcoming 70-300mm will be purchased and it isn't even critical testing that I do. If there's a visible difference that shouldn't be there it's annoying.\nPerhaps the ability to buy mail order and get an automatic right to return things has spoilt us to be less forgiving of variations?\nMaybe it has, or look at the glass half full, it's also made it pretty easy to return bad samples when you buy from places like Amazon. It's all luck of the draw IMO, I've seen people in other systems claim they never had an issue then one day they go thru 3 egregiously bad samples of one lens... I think at times it might happen in batches but that's just sheer speculation.\nRoger at LensRentals (who go thru *a lot* of lenses and have more insider info than any of us) has made some interesting tho generalized comments on this at his blog, and they don't even put Fuji lenses thru their testing so his comments were probably aimed more at CaNikon, Sony, Oly, and Pana... They've even posted \"heat map\"-like charts of the variation of lenses when they've tested a dozen of a given model (which they tend to do to rule out this very thing), it can be pretty wild for zooms.\nWish I had this lens in hand today.\nWell since the optics are unchanged you really only missing out on the new build if you have such an urgent need\nWR huge for me.\n@pather fan - Formula has same # Elements, same # of Groups, but has 4 ED elements instead of 3. So we'll have to wait to see what the comparison is, instead of guessing. Might be the same, who knows.\n@olivemoonstudioThey market it as the same\n@pather My apologies, the marketing material on the previous lens is incorrect in some places, but the lens diagram is correct. whoops!\nYou may also like\nLatest sample galleries\nLatest in-depth reviews\nThe Fujifilm XF 23mm F2 R WR delivers a 35mm full-frame equivalent field of view and stands out due to its small size and weather-resistant build.

        "raw_content": "The best of CES 2024\nCES 2024 has been a whirlwind for the Mashable team. Some products were bizarre, including the WeHead, which is designed to put a (creepy) face to AI. Others entertained us, including the TCL RayNeo X2 Lite smart glasses and LG\u2019s smart home robot.\nNow that we\u2019re headed back home, it\u2019s time for Mashable to look back at what we\u2019ve seen and determine the best tech products in the following categories: TV, laptop, car, tablet, phone, and wearable.\nAll of these products demonstrated some degree of innovation, allure, practicality, and technological advancement, eliciting feelings of intrigue, curiosity, and wonder.\nBest TV\nLG Signature OLED T\nA transparent TV might not be the most practical product. Why would you want a TV you can see through when the goal is to watch it? But that\u2019s where LG\u2019s innovation comes in. The LG Signature OLED T is a regular (albeit high-end) OLED TV that has a transparent mode when the contrast filter is lifted. This means when you\u2019re not watching it, the display seamlessly blends into the background.\nPlus, the OLED T comes with special designs and widgets for transparent mode that make it look like what Mashable's Stan Schroeder describes as a \"living sculpture.\" Before you ask, this is not just a concept TV. LG will actually be selling this futuristic display sometime this year. No word on price yet, but you can bet it costs about as much as a priceless work of art.\n\u2014 Cecily Mauran\nBest monitor\nAlienware 32-inch 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor\nMeet the world's first world\u2019s first 4K QD-OLED gaming monitor. It supports Dolby Vision, delivers a refresh rate of 240Hz, and offers an impressive responsive rate of 0.03 ms. Plus, according to what I've seen when I visited Dell's suite, it has top-of-the-line color performance, too.\nAnd guess what, it's only priced at $1,199.\nBest car\nRazer Lexus TX\nThis one gets in on a bit of a technicality because we didn\u2019t technically see it at a CES event. Instead, Razer had its promotional Lexus TX concept car sitting outside our hotel, which we ran across randomly at 11 p.m. one night. Serendipity!\nPut simply, it\u2019s a LAN party on wheels. Razer filled this 2024 Lexus TX with gamer chairs in the back rows, four widescreen gaming monitors, and even a desk and keyboard at one of the backseats. There\u2019s a series of RGB lights on the exterior that can change color on demand, too. It looks like a gaming laptop that\u2019s the size and shape of an SUV.\nThen you pop the trunk and see a docking station for four Razer gaming laptops and a built-in Xbox Series X. Razer\u2019s Lexus concept car may not be street legal, but it\u2019s our winner for best car at CES 2024.\n\u2014 Alex Perry\nBest tablet\nWacom Cintiq Pro drawing tablets\nI got a chance to test the Wacom Cintiq Pro at Showstoppers, and I was blown away by the number of nuanced tools that I got to use to facilitate my creativity as a drawing hobbyist. It delivers a 4K display, and whether it was the 27-inch, 22-inch or 17-inch, the tablet was spacious enough to tap into my affinity for drawing comics.\nThe Wacom Cintiq Pro comes with the new Wacom Pen, which felt ergonomic to the touch. It allowed me to use natural touch gestures, including rotating, zooming, and panning.\nFor anyone who is an artist, I'd highly recommend snagging one of Wacom's latest tablets on the market.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest laptop\nAsus Zenbook Duo\nThis dual-display laptop won our hearts, as it's able to transform into several different modes, including a lie-flat posture for sharing, a book-like mode that lets you multitask between two apps, and a stunning vertical workstation with two 14-inch displays, 3K OLED screen, and a 120Hz refresh rate.\nWhat makes it particularly striking is its pricing. Typically, laptops that facilitate multitasking functionality, including the HP Spectre Fold and the Lenovo Legion 9i, are quite pricey, climbing to $2,000 at the lowest end and up to $5,000 at the top end.\nSurprisingly, Asus' Zenbook Duo is only $1,500. Plus, it has a detachable keyboard that can be attached via Bluetooth or pogo pins, and it actually has a touchpad. Most keyboards in this class of laptop typically don't have touchpads, forcing you to navigate with your finger and smudge the display with your dirty little fingers. However, in the case of the Zenbook Duo, it has a touchpad, so you don't need to sully the display with your smears and ugly fingerprints.\nThe best part of the ZenBook Duo is its accessibility. Dual-display laptops are no longer out of reach for the average consumer.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest wearable\nXReal Air 2 Ultra\nWearables, and specifically AR wearables, were a big thing at CES 2024 this year. So, there are a lot of contenders for best wearable.\nTCL-incubated TCL RayNeo X2 Lite would easily steal the show with its real-time translations, complete with augmented reality captions. These wireless glasses were\u00a0impressive to see, but it still feels like an early work-in-progress version of what could be a superior future product.\nOn the contrary, XReal Air 2 Ultra was the most ready for primetime in the category that I tried. XReal is a leader in the AR wearable space and already had an AR glasses product that brings a crisp, clear HD in-glass display for on-the-go gaming and movie watching when you travel. The Air 2 Ultra upgrades those glasses into a light version of the Apple Vision Pro.\nWhat I really liked about XReal's approach here was that they seem to best understand the utility of the AR glasses they make. RayNeo and even Apple appear to believe that you will live in their product and choose the glasses over your smartphone or computer. XReal's approach is different. They seem to know that wearables, at least glasses wearables, are not there. Consumers are interested in using them for specific purposes, like playing video games while on an airplane.\nThe XReal Air 2 Ultra were also hands-down the most comfortable AR glasses I tried. And in this space, that alone would be enough to come out on top.\n\u2014 Matt Binder\nBest smart home\nSamsung Bespoke 4-Door Flex Refrigerator\nWhat struck me about Samsung's 4-Door Flex Refrigerator is that it can recognize 33 food items, thanks to its AI capabilities. This means that it can detect a variety of food stuff in your fridge, plus it can give you recipes based on what's inside.\n\u2014 Kimberly Gedeon\nBest concept\nBmind smart mirror\nEveryone wants an AI in everything now, including your mirror. Last year, Baracoda came to CES with BMind, a smart mirror with a focus on your personal wellness. Now, it\u2019s brought BMind back with a personal AI assistant that speaks to you about gratitude meditation and tips on how to be your best self on a bad day.\nMashable\u2019s AI reporter Cecily Mauran was able to get a hands-on experience with BMind and said that, unlike other smart AI assistants, Baracoda\u2019s CareOS takes privacy seriously. According to the company, the AI model and the information it receives is stored locally and it only connects to the internet if you want it to.\nIt\u2019s not available for consumers at the moment, as Baracoda instead is choosing to partner with mirror manufacturers. So don\u2019t be surprised if you see talking mirrors in the near future.\n\u2014 Chance Townsend\nUPDATE: Jan. 12, 2024, 5:22 p.m. EST This story has been updated to reflect the XReal Air 2 Ultra was Mashable\u2019s choice for \u201cBest Wearable.\u201d\nTopics\nCES"

        "raw_content": "October 4, 2023\nFujifilm To Exhibit Innovative Complete End-to-End Solution Product Portfolio at PRINTING United Expo 2023\nHANOVER PARK, ILL.\u00a0- FUJIFILM North America Corporation, Graphic Communication Division, announced today that it will be exhibiting its comprehensive print solutions at PRINTING United Expo 2023, October 18-20 in Atlanta. For the first time in North America, Fujifilm will be showcasing four key new technologies in its market-leading REVORIA PRESS\u2122 toner-based product line.\n\u201cWe\u2019re especially excited to share our expanded product portfolio with our customers at the PRINTING United Expo 2023,\u201d said Hidetoshi \u201cToshi\u201d Kino, General Manager, FUJIFILM North America Corporation, Graphic Communication Division. \u201cThis year, we have chosen to exhibit all our solutions from each segment of print, showing the total solution Fujifilm provides to our customers. As you will see, the spirit of Never Stop is very strong at Fujifilm. We Never Stop listening to our customers, addressing challenges and together, we Never Stop developing the next generation of print solutions.\u201d\nTo celebrate the advancements of the REVORIA PRESS series, a sneak peek of REVORIA PRESS\u2122 GC12500, the market\u2019s first B2 size, cut-sheet digital press using dry toner technology, will be presented onsite at Fujifilm\u2019s booth B2506. With the J PRESS 750HS already leading the professional, level high quality and high productivity transition from offset to digital, Fujifilm has turned its attention to making B2 size printing easy and efficient in order to develop new markets including the high-production quick printer segment. REVORIA PRESS GC12500 can print double sided on a maximum paper size of 26 x 29.5 inches, the largest in the industry. GC12500 can print six pages per sheet, in A4 or letter size and can handle a variety of paper weights, from 64 to 450 gsm. Additionally, Fujifilm has dramatically shortened a typical work line by consolidating the feeder, stacker, and control panel on one side for the press operator.\nBuilding off the launch of the REVORIA PRESS\u2122 PC1120, 6 color inline press and the E-1 Series Monochrome press earlier this year, Fujifilm\u2019s North American toner-based product lineup will also now include the REVORIA PRESS\u2122 EC1100, SC180, and APEOSPRO C810 models, all of which will be available for view onsite at Booth B2506.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0REVORIA PRESS EC1100 and SC180 -- designed to accommodate both commercial printing and quick, on-demand printing, the REVORIA PRESS EC1100 outputs approximately 100 pages per minute. Designed for smaller in-house print jobs, the REVORIA PRESS SC180 prints at approximately 80 pages per minute. These two new models are highly versatile and can handle a broad range of paper weights and various paper sizes, from standard to banner. For both models, the Air Suction Feeder design optimizes feed performance of all media, including paper carrying a lot of paper dust, pre-printed paper using powder, paper with uneven texture, and coated paper that is prone to feeding issues. Stable and high-speed feeding is achieved for various paper types, from lightweight to heavyweight, and from small sizes to long banner sheets.\n\u2022\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0APEOSPRO C810 is designed to produce superior, high-quality printing on a wide range of substrates, enabling users to quickly turn out jobs of any size. It can produce flyers, brochures, catalogs, and a range of other marketing collateral, including banners up to roughly four feet in length. \u00a0This printer is also ideally suited to the production of product mock-ups and other samples/prototypes. APEOSPRO C810 can accommodate a wide range of paper types, ranging from lightweight paper, cardstock, and postcards, to heavier, embossed paper and envelopes.\nAPEOSPRO C810 also benefits from the first high-resolution (2400 x 2400 dpi) LED printhead, which creates a high-definition print from a very thin LED beam. The exposure unit produces very little vibration because there is no drive mechanism, meaning image reproduction is incredibly stable, and the LED printhead itself consumes very low levels of energy, which translates to low operating costs. APEOSPRO C810 also benefits from the use of Fujifilm\u2019s Super EA-Eco toner. In combination, the Super EA-Eco toner and LED printheads produce ultra-smooth gradations, and vibrant colors, and the combination of those products facilitate the reproduction of images with very fine lines and text. An additional \u2018gloss\u2019 function brings a beautiful sheen to print.\nThe entire REVORIA PRESS product line provides customers a wide variety of finishing options, including punch, staple, saddle staple, single fold, Z-fold half sheet/tri-fold, crease, face trim, full bleed trim, and square back.\nFujifilm\u2019s booth at the PRINTING United Expo 2023 will also feature live production and demonstrations of the company\u2019s popular UV inkjet wide format presses, including the Acuity Ultra R2 and Acuity Ultra Hybrid LED, and the 2023 Pinnacle award-winning J PRESS 750HS, and in collaboration with FUJIFILM DIMATIX division, live demonstration of inkjet print bar solutions.\nThe entire Fujifilm booth will be utilizing Fujifilm\u2019s ColorPath SYNC\u2122 color management technology to characterize, profile, and ensure accuracy across devices and to industry standard printing conditions.\nFujifilm\u2019s booth B2506 will also feature dedicated product zones and application displays staffed with subject matter experts for print segments including commercial print, analog and digital packaging. In addition, for the first time, Fujifilm\u2019s booth B2506 will feature a \u201cPhoto Zone\u201d in partnership with Fujifilm\u2019s Imaging Division. The \u201cPhoto Zone\u201d will highlight Fujifilm\u2019s legacy of photo innovation with a gallery wall printed on J Press 750HS and REVORIA PRESS PC1120 illustrating the accuracy and precision of Fujifilm\u2019s technology and its continuing commitment to the photographer.\n\u201cDon\u2019t miss the opportunity to stop by our booth for a sneak peek at some future innovations Fujifilm is working on,\u201d said Mark Friedman, vice president, Marketing, FUJIFILM North America Corporation, Graphic Communication Division. \u201cWe\u2019re very proud of the advances we\u2019ve made in developing the latest, cutting-edge technologies that will keep driving the print industry forward.\u201d\nFUJIFILM North America Corporation, Graphic Communication Division, will be at PRINTING United Expo, Booth B2506, October 18-20, 2023, at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta.
