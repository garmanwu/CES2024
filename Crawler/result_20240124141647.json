The university enrolls over 3,000 international students each year, and sends more than 3,300 students on study abroad programs annually. As of 2018[update], Hanyang University had 777 partner universities in 76 countries.[4]\nHistory[edit]\nHanyang University was founded as Dong-A Engineering Institute on July 1, 1939, during the Japanese occupation of Korea. Dong-A Institute started with 630 students and 35 faculty in Jongno District, Seoul. After producing its first graduates in 1941, Dong-A tried to elevate itself to college status, to no avail. In May 1941, the Institute relocated and offered education specializing in engineering and technology to 100 students who had finished secondary school. In 1943, with Korea still under Japanese occupation, the institute was suspended from recruiting new students. This resulted in a temporary shutdown of the school on March 15, 1944, when the last 78 students graduated.[5][6]\nUpon the restoration of the nation's independence in August 1945, Dong-A Institute renamed itself the Engineering Institute for National Foundation. Institute founder Dr. Kim Lyun-joon foresaw the importance of industrial advancement in the reconstruction of Korea and established Hanyang University as a judicial and academic body. The board of trustees at that time included Myowook Lee, Byeongok Cho, Kwansoo Baik, Wonchul Lee, Waljoon Kim, Taeyong Choi, and Lyunjoon Kim, who had led the nation's independence movement. In July 1948, the school was accredited as the first four-year engineering college in Korea with Kim Lyun-joon as the first dean. Six engineering sub-departments were set up, as well as a secondary school.[5][6]\nDuring the Korean War, many of the school's facilities were destroyed and the professors and students were scattered. However, classes were continued in Busan with temporary teachers. Even during their refuge, the college fostered numerous competent science teachers by building a training center for secondary school teachers in the technical fields. In 1953, Hanyang University was authorized as a graduate school by the Ministry of Education.[5][6]\nCampuses[edit]\nSeoul[edit]\nThe Seoul campus is home to 15 colleges and 60 departments.[7] It comprises a variety of research centers, which are based on distinct academic fields. The Seoul campus has more than 60 buildings, including those of Hanyang Women's University and Hanyang Cyber University. In 2009, a new administration building was completed to commemorate HYU's 70th anniversary.[8] The Center for Students with Disabilities was also built the same year.[9] The campus also has a number of auxiliary facilities, which are unconnected to but affiliated with the university.[9] There is Infonopia Hanyang (\ubc31\ub0a8\ud559\uc220\uc815\ubcf4\uad00), which has a collection of 1.5 million books, 12,500 serial publications, 83,000 electronic journals, and 50 academic databases.\nERICA[edit]\nThe ERICA (Education Research Industry Cluster at Ansan) campus is located in Ansan, Gyeonggi Province, approximately 40\u00a0km south of Seoul.[10] In 2009, the ERICA campus of Hanyang University was designated as a government-supported public bicycle pilot school and received donations of infrastructure and bicycles, including public bicycle systems and storage stations.[11] ERICA Campus is home to 9 colleges and 42 departments.[12] The ERICA Campus is known for a program known as the Education Research Industry Cluster Program, which is intended to develop vocational skills.[13][14] The ERICA Campus has three on-campus dormitories[15] and five school cafeterias.[16] It also has an ecological park.\nGraduate Schools[edit]\nThe graduate programs of Hanyang University are divided into three schools: the General Graduate School, Professional Graduate School, and Special Graduate School.[17] Professional Graduate Schools focus more on vocational skills, while Special Graduate Schools focuses on research related to fieldwork. The General Graduate School offers 87 Master's programs and 85 doctoral programs.[17]\nPrograms[edit]\nSeoul campus[18]\nThe Seoul campus of HYU offers undergraduate programs in:\nERICA campus\nThe ERICA campus in Ansan offers undergraduate programs in:[19]\nGraduate school\nThe HYU Graduate School offers graduate programs in:\nInternational programs[12][20]\nFirst introduced in 2016, the G2 (English-Chinese) Language Education Program obligates the completion of an English and Chinese course and has an official grade of both languages as a mandatory requirement.\nResearch and development[edit]\nHanyang University maintains active research programs in biological sciences, natural sciences, medicine, natural resources and environment, media and communication, and business administration. Hanyang has designated \u201cOutreaching Research Competitiveness\u201d as one of its key strategic directions under the NEW HANYANG 2020 plan.[21] For its part, the Industry-University Cooperation Foundation (IUCF) is working to promote more individual and collaborative research at HYU by providing funding for research projects from their initial stage, and offering assistance in the publication of research papers in prominent international journals, among other duties.\nKey research accomplishments[edit]\nHYU's reputation for research has resulted in following key accomplishments:[22][23][24][25]\nReputation[edit]\nRankings[edit]\nJoong-Ang Ilbo University Ranking\nIn 2016, Joongang Ilbo ranked Hanyang University's Seoul Campus 2nd and ERICA Campus 9th in the country.\nIn 2017, Joongang Ilbo ranked Hanyang University's Seoul Campus 3rd and ERICA Campus 9th in the country.[39]\nIn 2018, Joongang Ilbo ranked Hanyang University's Seoul Campus 3rd and ERICA Campus 9th in the country.[40]\nKorea Economic Daily Engineering School Assessment\nHanyang University has been consistently ranked the #1 engineering school in the nation.\nIn 2016, Hanyang University Ranked First in 2016 Engineering School Assessment in the country.\nIn the \"2016 Engineering School Assessment\" conducted jointly by the Korea Economic Daily and Global Research, Hanyang University was ranked No. 1 with the total score of 299 points. Hanyang University won the highest score in an evaluation of the nation's 50 engineering schools, in terms of industry-university cooperation, technology commercialization, and start-up and job search support, as well as education and research quality. Runners-up included Sungkyunkwan University, KAIST, POSTECH, and Seoul National University.[41]\nQS World University Ranking\nHanyang University is ranked 157th on the QS World University list in 2023.\nThe World's Most Innovative Universities by Reuters\nHanyang has been named among the world's top 100 most innovative universities by Reuters. The ranking was determined by the composite score of several metrics that were focused on academic papers and patent filings. Reuters ranked Hanyang 5th among Korean universities and 62nd globally in 2015.[42]\nNotable alumni[edit]\nPublic Sector[edit]\nBusiness[edit]\nArts and literature[edit]\nSports[edit]\nEntertainment[edit]\nDisputes[edit]\nDuring the 2019\u201320 Hong Kong protests, some students in Hanyang University showed their support for Hong Kong. On 14 November 2019, it was reported that a number of local students in Hanyang University and Korea University were attacked and beaten up by students from China. The posters prepared by the Korean students were also destroyed. The dispute extended to the internet. Some Korean students asked those students to go back to China if they were so patriotic.[51]\nReferences[edit]\nExternal links[edit]"

Over the past years, it has become more apparent than ever: we face a climate crisis and air transport is responsible for up to 10% of humankind\u2019s contribution to global warming. But should students stop pursuing their dreams of studying abroad and sacrifice their future goals? We don\u2019t think so!\nWe see it as our responsibility to preserve our environment, live a sustainable life, and minimize the carbon footprint of each of our students. Consequently, Asia Exchange has chosen to work with\u00a0Atmosfair,\u00a0a non-profit organization that actively contributes to CO\u2082 mitigation and offers Co2 offsetting.

In 1948, it was the first private university that actually developed by the engineering department and in 1959, it expanded into different ranges. In addition, in 1979, Hanyang University built their second campus in Ansan, Gyeonggi-do, one of the biggest industrial complexes in our country. As of 2011, Hanyang University has 2 campuses with students in all from both college and graduate school. It is also operating a hospital that has a large scale of having approximately 1,400 sickbeds. This in all shows how big the university is and what kind of important role it play in our country. After Hanyang University was established, for 72 years, it has been concentrating its effort in the education theory of fostering talented students by following the idea of trying to become a university that can be of help to the society through practical method of study. As a result, between the 70s and the 80s, Hanyang University was acknowledged for discharging excellent students who have contributed to the country's phenomenal change in both the industrial area and modern age. Hanyang University was very proud of starting out in the area engineering, but now it is even more proud of the reputation that it carries as it slowly expanded the education range to medical, humanities, social sciences, performing arts, and much more.

Hanyang University's technology patriotism of philosophy that serves as a background to the school's establishment is 'Practical Method of Study' which has been in succession in the education tradition for a very long time. For this reason and due to the society's demand, the school has developed and stabilized itself as a group culture that can rapidly satisfy the needs of the society through education and research. Consequently, it has been deemed to be the university that has contributed the most to our country's modern age and industrialism. Since Erica campus is very close to the industrial complex, it has taken advantage of that geographical attribute by opening up the biggest Center for Business Incubation as well as a Technopark. Moreover, it is trying to construct the biggest ERICA cluster in our country so that it can focus on placing corporations and government research centers within the campus.\nAbout Hanyang University\nHanyang University was established in 1939 by Lyun-Joon Kim, who desired greatly for the advancement of the country through technology education.
