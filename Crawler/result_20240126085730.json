Our editors and medical experts rigorously evaluate every article and guide to ensure the information is factual, up-to-date, and free of bias.\nThe Sleep Foundation fact-checking guidelines are as follows:\nTable of Contents\nSleep had a moment in the limelight this year. As a\nthird of Americans still don\u2019t get enough sleep,\nTrusted Source\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\nAs the nation\u2019s health protection agency, CDC saves lives and protects people from health threats.\nView Source\nwe tried a lot of new trends to improve our nightly outlook. We invested in expensive sheets and fancy alarms that double as sunrise clocks. We tested out sleep tourism and rested in luxury hotels with elaborate sleep sprays and silk face masks. We even relied on\nclassic American actors and their soothing voices\nTrusted Source\nNew York Times\nThe New York Times is an American newspaper based in New York City with worldwide influence and readership.\nView Source\nto lull us to sleep. This year was great for many reasons, but a highlight was our newfound emphasis on sleep health.\nAccording to Google Trends, \u2018sleep\u2019 hit an all-time high as a search topic in 2023. Specific searches such as, \u2018Why am I tired all the time\u2019 were especially common as Americans flocked to Google to troubleshoot their sleep issues.\n\u201cWe live in a world that glamorizes the grind, which means millions of people are living in a chronic stress state,\u201d says Sarah Silverman, PsyD, a behavioral sleep medicine specialist who trained at the Stanford Sleep Medicine Center. \u201c[This] leads to numbing behaviors such as watching Netflix for hours or mindlessly scrolling social media to avoid daily stressors.\u201d\nOver the past year, Americans sought to fix their sleep issues through a number of avenues. According to a November 2023 SleepFoundation.org survey of 1000 Americans, 20% of us struggled with night wakeups, and 17% simply couldn\u2019t fall asleep. So, we tried some new things. Some 27% of us limited our caffeine consumption, and 25% considered a smart mattress. 15% of respondents even tried sleep divorce\u2014sleeping separately from their partner\u2014to fix their sleep woes.\nBut did all those\ntrending TikTok videos\nTrusted Source\nAmerican Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM)\nAASM sets standards and promotes excellence in sleep medicine health care, education, and research.\nView Source\nactually change our sleep behavior? We took a look at the past year in sleep. Here\u2019s what we found.\nWhy Were We Suddenly Interested in Sleep?\nSleep is a basic human need and something we\u2019ve always required to function in daily life. So, it\u2019s interesting to note that 2023 was when the topic popped onto the radar for so many folks. There isn\u2019t any single reason, but some experts still think Covid-19 is to blame.\n\u201cThe significant worsening of sleep during the pandemic was the biggest driving force\u2026 With so many more people working from home and losing that routine, we saw sleep patterns worsen overall.\u201d\n\u2013Dr. Angela Holliday-Bell, physician and Certified Sleep Specialist\n\u201cThe significant worsening of sleep during the pandemic was the biggest driving force, I think,\u201d says Dr. Angela Holliday-Bell, a board-certified physician and certified sleep specialist. \u201cWith so many more people working from home and losing routines, we saw sleep patterns worsen overall.\u201d\nDr. Holliday-Bell also thinks that our newfound interest in sleep comes from the availability of so much new information. People are exposed to novel ideas and concepts on social media, and there are a lot more sleep-focused tech gadgets on the market today. \u201cWith the advent of things like sleep trackers, people have become more aware of poor sleep habits,\u201d she says.\nSleep disorders made headlines in 2023 too. In June, the\npress reported that President Biden began using a CPAP machine for sleep apnea,\na condition that causes pauses in breathing and disrupts sleep during the night. This announcement launched sleep apnea into the spotlight for many people who hadn\u2019t been familiar with it.\nQuirky Sleep Hacks Filled the Internet\nOn TikTok, several sleep-related hacks took the country by storm. Bed rotting\u2014lounging in bed all day by choice\u2014was one of them, sweeping the Internet over the summer. This past spring, \u2018Sleepy Girl Mocktails\u2018 were all the rage. Viewers mixed up tart cherry juice-based concoctions purported to provide the best-ever night of sleep.\nEven though these trends became Internet-famous, data surrounding their effectiveness is inconclusive. According to survey respondents, only 13% tried bed rotting, which may be a good thing. \u201cSpending too much time in bed can weaken your sleep drive,\u201d Silverman says. She also notes that there is limited research to support tart cherry juice as a sleep aid.\nMaura Jenkins, a 24-year-old freelance writer based in Denver, Colorado, first learned about mouth taping after listening to a podcast. This is the increasingly popular practice of taping your mouth shut at night in an effort to decrease fatigue and snoring and increase concentration levels during the day. Mouth taping saw a surge this year after it trended on TikTok.\nAfter noticing all the sleep-related conversations online this year, Jenkins was inspired to improve her own. \u201cI thought I was a bad sleeper and had to deal with the cards I was dealt,\u201d she says. But all the online talk led her to mouth taping\u2014and she says it\u2019s really working for her.\n\u201cWith mouth taping, I\u2019m falling into a deeper sleep and wake up feeling so rested,\u201d Jenkins says. She notes that she can recall dreams from the night before, which she couldn\u2019t do previously. That said, only 7% of survey respondents have tried mouth taping.\nBut, 45% of respondents said they took a shower before bed to improve their sleep, making it the most popular sleep hack. Another 26% relied on a weighted blanket or opening a window.\nMeanwhile, 12% of respondents tried using a sleep tracker for the first time in 2023. Sleep trackers\u2014gadgets that monitor your sleep and report on the length and quality\u2014have grown quite popular, with brands like Garmin, Fitbit, Apple Watch, and Oura all making rings, bracelets, or watches. Katie Levy, a 39-year-old technology consultant in Bellingham, Washington, began using the Whoop bracelet to figure out how her sleep quality and quantity affect her life.\n\u201cIt\u2019s a part of my routine now,\u201d Levy says. \u201cIt\u2019s one variable that helps me make sure I\u2019m fueled properly and rested for the activities I like to do.\u201d But she also says that there is some anxiety that comes with seeing poor data in the morning. Levy notes that she just tries to remember that sleep tracking is but one variable among others (like exercise and diet) that helps to try to get sufficient sleep.\nSleep Trends Actually Worth Following\nWith TikTok and social media throwing sleep hacks at us all year long, it may feel daunting to now find one that is actually vetted by science. According to both Dr. Holliday-Bell and Silverman, there is one concept to latch onto: circadian rhythms, our bodies\u2019 internal 24-hour clocks. Both sleep specialists agree that any innovative products emphasizing our unique circadian rhythms are worth a look.\n\u201cSleep gadgets \u2026 such as light therapy glasses for the morning and red light at night will have a significant effect on people\u2019s sleep,\u201d says Dr. Holliday-Bell. Light therapy glasses expose people to various wavelengths of light to help manage our internal clocks and encourage better nighttime sleep. She believes that a lot of sleep disruption boils down to circadian disruption, so realigning those rhythms could be a powerful solution.\n\u201cStructuring your day versus night from more of a circadian-aligned standpoint has been shown to lead to better health outcomes and increased longevity\u201d\n\u2013Sarah Silverman, PsyD, behavioral sleep medicine specialist\nSilverman agrees, noting that bio-individuality is crucial. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a one-size-fits-all approach to addressing individual health needs,\u201d she says. As a starting point, Silverman suggests learning about your chronotype to determine basics like whether you\u2019re an early bird or a night owl. Use that information\u2014rather than the latest TikTok trends\u2014 as a guide rail for further decisions. \u201cStructuring your day versus night from more of a circadian-aligned standpoint has been shown to lead to better health outcomes and increased longevity,\u201d Silverman says.\nMethodology\nThe survey commissioned by SleepFoundation.org was conducted on the online survey platform Pollfish in November 2023. Results are from 1,000 survey participants in the United States who were ages 18 and older at the time of the survey. All respondents attested to answering the survey questions truthfully and accurately.\nGot a hot tip?

This connected anti-stress ball inflates and deflates, guiding breathing exercises conducive to falling asleep.\n\"I was super skeptical,\" said Michael Broes, co-founder of the Belgian start-up, before explaining that these exercises enable you to synchronize your heart rate with your breathing rate, a key element in relaxation.\nAnother sleep-disturbing factor is bed temperature.\n\"We made a lot of market surveys and asked a lot of people around the world and the main issue with bad sleep is temperature,\" said Daniela Kooijman of Variowell, a German company that has developed heating and cooling strips for mattresses.\nMany manufacturers have invested in temperature control systems for different body zones on either side of the bed.\nLike the Chinese company DeRucci, whose AI-inflated mattresses change shape according to the sleeper's position and analyze his or her sleep.\nZhu Huan, with DeRucci's smart sleep division, said the products are the result of a decade of research and development.\nThe price of the perfect bed: between $3,000 and $20,000, depending on the options.\n\u00a9 2024 AFP\nExplore further\nFacebook\nTwitter\nEmail\nFeedback to editors\n10 hours ago\n0\nJan 24, 2024\n0\nJan 22, 2024\n1\nJan 22, 2024\n0\nJan 22, 2024\n0\n3 hours ago\n4 hours ago\n7 hours ago\n7 hours ago\n9 hours ago\n9 hours ago\n10 hours ago\nJan 24, 2024\nJan 24, 2024\nJan 24, 2024\nRelated Stories\nAug 11, 2023\nApr 18, 2023\nApr 11, 2022\nApr 6, 2023\nMay 23, 2023\nOct 17, 2017\nRecommended for you\nJan 17, 2024\nJan 17, 2024\nJan 9, 2024\nDec 28, 2023\nDec 21, 2023\nDec 7, 2023\nUse this form if you have come across a typo, inaccuracy or would like to send an edit request for the content on this page.\nFor general inquiries, please use our\ncontact form.\nFor general feedback, use the public comments section below (please adhere to guidelines).\nPlease select the most appropriate category to facilitate processing of your request\nThank you for taking time to provide your feedback to the editors.\nYour feedback is important to us.

Please also consider subscribing to WIRED\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nOur team of consumer tech reporters has been in Las Vegas since the weekend, tracking all of the new products being announced at CES. Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

As described by Embr Labs, the Ember Wave wrist-worn device delivers soothing cool or warm waves of temperature to the inside of the wrist to help users drift off to sleep, diminish nighttime bursts of warmth or night sweats that can disrupt sleep, and prevent returning to sleep, and help keep users from waking throughout the night.\nPocket Kado, the winner in the Sleep Disorders and Conditions category, describes their product as the world\u2019s first science-backed virtual pet game to help users sleep. Through gameplay, users can develop their sleep hygiene and maintain routines that align with their circadian rhythm, which also may help users live well with insomnia, including if they have completed Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for Insomnia (CBT-I).\n\u201cWe congratulate Embr Labs and Pocket Kado for winning our 2023 SleepTech Award.

Most models measure 72 inches wide by 84 inches long. These dimensions make it the longest mattress size. While many think of the California king as the largest size option, standard kings \u2013 which measure 76 inches wide by 80 inches long \u2013 technically offer more surface area. A California king is ideal for couples who want a spacious sleep surface, including those who share their bed with children or pets. King and California king models usually share the same price-point.\nA single sleeper may enjoy the roominess of a California king, but we primarily focused on criteria that matter most to couples when choosing our top picks for this list. These factors include durability, edge support, motion isolation, temperature control, and responsiveness for sex. Value is another key consideration, since California king sizes are one of the most expensive options for any given model.\nWhat\u2019s The Best California King Size Mattress?\nCalifornia king is the longest standard mattress size, giving you 7 feet of length, and also one of the widest options for couples.

You can choose from four firmness levels, all of which pair adaptive comfort layers with zoned coils to create a very balanced feel. Our field testers who sleep on this mattress point to its consistent pressure relief and excellent overall support.\u201d\n\u2013 Logan Foley, Managing Editor\nPros\nHybrid design cushions the body without sacrificing support\nZoned coils push back against the weight in your midsection\nFour firmness options\nCons\nFoam layers may emit some strong off-gassing odor at first\nCo-sleepers likely to feel each other\u2019s movements\nMattress Type\nInnerspring\nFirmness Options\nMedium Soft (4), Medium Firm (6), Firm (7), Firm (8)\nPrice Range\n$1,149 \u2013 $2,049\nTrial Period\n120 nights (30 night requirement)\nThe WinkBed is a versatile hybrid mattress available in four firmness levels. The balanced construction and multiple firmness options make the mattress a great choice for a wide variety of sleepers \u2013 especially those seeking a combination of surface-level cushioning and strong overall support.\nWhat It\u2019s Made of\nThe four firmness levels of the WinkBed are medium soft (4), medium firm (6), firm (7), and firm (8). The mattress features a Euro-top padded with adaptive foam, which is infused with cooling gel intended to disperse body heat. High-density polyfoam beneath the top layer provides additional contouring and support. The base layer contains pocketed coils arranged in a zoned layout, ensuring extra reinforcement for the midsection and minimal sinkage along the perimeter. The entire mattress is encased in a Tencel cover.\nMost WinkBed models share the same basic design, but they vary slightly to produce different firmness levels. Most notably, the medium soft model has an extra polyfoam layer to confer softness. The firmest model, known as the WinkBed Plus, is composed of polyfoam and latex layers on top and a zoned coil base on the bottom.\nHow It Performed\nEdge support is one of the WinkBed\u2019s key strengths due to the zoned coils. Temperature control is another highlight, thanks to the breathable Tencel cover and strong airflow throughout the coil support core. These features make the WinkBed a suitable option for couples.\nDuring our tests, the medium firm WinkBed was one of the most versatile models. The mattress earned rave reviews from back and stomach sleepers weighing up to 230 pounds, as well as side sleepers weighing 130 to 230 pounds. Many testers attributed the mattress\u2019 exceptional comfort to its mid-level firmness and ultra-supportive feel. The medium soft model was best suited for side and back sleepers up to 130 pounds, while the firmer models were most beneficial for back and stomach sleepers over 130 pounds.\nWinkBed mattresses ship free to the contiguous U.S. Customers may purchase White Glove delivery and old mattress removal as well. The mattress comes with a 120-night sleep trial and lifetime warranty.\nMost Comfortable Mattress\nHelix Midnight\n20% off sitewide + 2 free pillows with mattress purchase\n8.99\n/10\nTest Lab Score\n9\n/10\nCustomer Score\n\u201cThe affordably priced Helix Midnight has a balanced design that should appeal to a wide range of sleepers.

This design benefits side sleepers who need a bed that supports the body but also cradles areas with pressure buildup.\nWhat It\u2019s Made of\nThe comfort system in the Helix Midnight is made of two foam layers. The top layer is Memory Plus Foam, a proprietary memory foam that cradles the body to support the spine and reduce pressure but also offers more bounce and retains less heat than traditional viscoelastic foam. This springiness is complemented by an underlying layer of transition polyfoam that fortifies the comfort system against an excess amount of sinking or sagging. The support core is made with individually wrapped coils that are strengthened around the edge.\nHow It Performed\nThe Helix Midnight has a medium firm (6) feel that should feel comfortable for a broad swath of sleepers. With ample contouring from the Memory Plus Foam, this model is excellent for most side and back sleepers, especially those between 130 and 230 pounds. The contouring cushions the shoulders, hips, and spine while the coil system amps up responsiveness to support the lumbar region. The responsive surface also makes it easy to change positions and move on the mattress.\nAt an accessible price-point, the Helix Midnight is a solid choice for people who want a quality bed but are working with a tight budget. For those with a bit more to spend, the Helix Midnight Luxe adds another layer of memory foam, plus an enhanced coil core with a zoned support system.\nAfter delivery, customers have 100 nights to try out the Helix Midnight with the option to return it for a full refund. A 10-year warranty protects against mattress defects.\nBest Value Mattress\nSilk & Snow Mattress\n$150 off\n8.14\n/10\nTest Lab Score\n9\n/10\nCustomer Score\n\u201cThe all-foam Silk & Snow is a solid pick if you\u2019re looking for that cradling hug only memory foam can deliver. Side sleepers on our team were especially impressed, as were back and stomach sleepers under 130 pounds.\u201d\n\u2013 Jeremy Klein, Senior Product Expert\nPros\nTriple-layer foam design offers strong contouring to reduce pressure buildup\nMemory foam layer has above-average density to prevent excessive sinkage\nCover is removable and machine-washable\nCons\nHot sleepers may overheat\nDeep \u201chug\u201d reduces ease of movement\nMattress Type\nFoam\nFirmness Options\nMedium (5)\nPrice Range\n$600 \u2013 $900\nTrial Period\n100 nights (30-night requirement)\nThe Silk & Snow Mattress is an all-foam bed that offers excellent contouring for sleepers who experience painful pressure buildup. The bed carries an attractive price-point given the quality of its materials, especially compared to other beds in similar price ranges.\nWhat It\u2019s Made of\nThe mattress features three layers of foam and has a medium (5) feel. It begins with a top layer of memory foam infused with a cooling gel. This foam has a higher density composition than some competing memory foam beds, which generates stronger support. The next layer is made of polyfoam that balances cushioning with support, while the bottom layer is dense and supportive to create a sturdy base for the bed. The removable and machine washable cover is made of a polyester and spandex fabric blend.\nHow It Performed\nDuring performance tests, we found that the Silk & Snow\u2019s foam layers excelled at relieving pressure buildup in areas like the shoulders, hips, and spine, which exert more pressure on the bed surface during sleep. The foam also absorbed a lot of motion, so our testers barely felt each other\u2019s movements when sharing the bed. This is an asset for couples, especially if you wake easily when your sleep partner moves at night.

Customers have the option to pick between two mattress heights, with no difference in feel.\nWhat It\u2019s Made of\nYou can choose between three firmness levels: soft (3), medium firm (6), and firm (8). All three models have a Euro-top followed by two thin layers of polyfoam and memory foam, which provide some cushion as well as lumbar support. A transitional layer of individually pocketed minicoils provides extra support while creating minimal motion transfer. Below, the hourglass coil support core has a foam encasement reinforcing the perimeter, helping provide support right up to the edge of the bed. The entire mattress is wrapped in a tufted organic cotton cover with a natural thistle fire retardant.\nHow It Performed\nDuring our tests, we found the dual coil system provided excellent relief for sleepers who are susceptible to uncomfortable pressure buildup. Side sleepers, in particular, gave the mattress high marks since this position tends to put pressure on the shoulders and hips. The mattress may also appeal to people who run hot during sleep. The top layer of coils is situated close to the surface, so this layer goes a long way toward promoting airflow and helping maintain a cool sleep surface.\nSaatva offers a 365-night sleep trial and a lifetime warranty. Orders in the contiguous U.S. include free White Glove delivery and old mattress removal.\nBest Mattress for Side Sleepers\nNolah Evolution 15\nCheck Offer at NolahMattress.com\n9.09\n/10\nTest Lab Score\n9.8\n/10\nCustomer Score\n\u201cSide sleepers like me don\u2019t always have the best experiences on hybrids, but the Nolah Evolution\u2019s deep foam system really sets it apart from the competition.

You can choose between medium (5), medium firm (6), and firm (8) options, which Nolah has named Plush, Luxury Firm, and Firm, respectively. While materials and specifications vary a bit between models, all three feature several cooling features and a foam comfort system that hugs pressure-prone areas.\nWhat It\u2019s Made of\nThe support core is built from pocketed coils that are zoned and reinforced at the edges. A layer of polyfoam rests above the core and prevents sleepers from sinking too deeply into the mattress, even when using the softest model. Proprietary graphite-infused polyfoam called AirFoam gently cradles your body and helps draw excess heat away from you while you sleep.\nHow It Performed\nEach model features a quilted Euro-top that cushions without affecting the support level. In addition to the AirFoam, the Evolution 15 includes a heat escape gusset, thermal conductive fabric, and a layer of wool and cotton that are all included to help regulate temperature. A carrying handle and non-skid base allow for easy use. The zoned coil layer provides more robust support around your lower back and midsection while allowing more give beneath your shoulders and legs.\nSix standard sizes are available, as well as a split king size for people who own adjustable beds. Nolah provides a 120-night sleep trial as well as a lifetime warranty, though you can opt out of the free trial for added savings. Free shipping is available to shoppers in the contiguous U.S. and you can choose to add old mattress removal and set up at checkout.\nBest Mattress for Couples\nLeesa Sapira Hybrid\nCheck Offer at Leesa.com\n8.91\n/10\nTest Lab Score\n8.8\n/10\nCustomer Score\n\u201cThe Leesa Sapira Hybrid\u2019s thoughtful design elevates it over many competing models. Most of our testers had good things to say about the mattress in terms of pressure relief, temperature control, and easy movement.\u201d\n\u2014 Tom Ryan, Director of Product Testing\nPros\nAerated foam and ventilated coils promote airflow to help the mattress sleep cool\nPerimeter reinforcement in the support core protects the edges from excessive sinkage\nAbove-average pressure relief compared to other hybrid models\nCons\nBack and stomach sleepers over 230 pounds may experience uncomfortable sinkage\nPotential for foam off-gassing in the first few days after unboxing\nMattress Type\nHybrid\nFirmness Options\nMedium Firm (6)\nPrice Range\n$1,349 \u2013 $2,299\nTrial Period\n100 nights (30 night requirement)\nThe Leesa Sapira Hybrid is designed with balanced comfort in mind. Thick foam layers over a sturdy support core of pocketed coils allow the mattress to excel in several key performance areas, including pressure relief, edge support, and temperature control \u2014 all qualities that are important for couples seeking a new bed.\nWhat It\u2019s Made of\nThe Leesa Sapira Hybrid\u2019s comfort system contains a top comfort layer of polyfoam over a secondary memory foam layer. The polyfoam is punched with large holes intended to promote air circulation near the surface of the mattress. This layer has a lightly responsive feel, whereas the memory foam molds to your body\u2019s contours as you sink into the surface. This creates a feeling of both sleeping \u201cin\u201d and sleeping \u201con\u201d the mattress.\nThe Sapira Hybrid also features a transitional layer of dense polyfoam over a pocketed coil system and a foam base layer. The coils are zoned for added reinforcement along the perimeter to provide pushback and reduce sinkage. A knit polyester cover encases the entire mattress.\nHow It Performed\nThe Leesa Sapira Hybrid is considered medium firm (6), so sleepers should expect gentle contouring and strong overall support. Among our testers, the mattress received the most positive ratings from side sleepers who weigh at least 130 pounds, and back and stomach sleepers under 130 pounds.\nThe Sapira Hybrid also scores points for temperature control, thanks in large part to the aerated foam layer and steady air currents flowing through the coil system. Other major strengths include edge support and ease of movement. The responsive coils ensure most people can move across the surface without feeling trapped by the mattress, while the perimeter feels exceptionally sturdy.\nLeesa offers free ground shipping for customers in all 50 states. Sapira Hybrid orders include a 100-night sleep trial with free returns after a 30-night break-in period, and those who keep the mattress also receive a 10-year manufacturer\u2019s warranty.\nBest Mattress for Back Pain\nBear Elite Hybrid\nCheck Offer at BearMattress.com\n8.41\n/10\nTest Lab Score\n9.4\n/10\nCustomer Score\n\u201cIf you struggle with back pain, our tests show the Bear Elite Hybrid should provide enough contouring on the surface to alleviate your pressure points and sore spots.

The Bear Elite Hybrid is a hybrid with foam layers that relieve pressure and evenly distribute weight, while a coil system keeps your body on an even plane. With three firmness options to choose from, you can pick the design best suited for your sleep position and body type.\nWhat It\u2019s Made of\nThe Bear Elite Hybrid comes in medium (5), medium firm (6), and firm (8) options. All three models begin with a quilted cover and layer of adaptive memory foam. Underneath is a polyfoam transitional layer that acts as a buffer between your body and the coils. These comfort layers vary in firmness depending on which firmness option you choose. Pocketed coils reinforce the sleep surface and strengthen the edges of the mattress. The coils rest on a polyfoam base layer for extra stability.\nThe cover is made of a proprietary fabric blend that integrates Celliant, a material engineered to absorb your body heat, turn it into infrared energy, and confer it back to you to promote recovery. The cover is also infused with phase change material (PCM) that helps regulate temperature.\nHow It Performed\nThe medium firm and firm options of the Bear Elite Hybrid are easy to move across without sinking or feeling stuck. This can be attributed to a coil system that makes the surface bouncy and reinforces the perimeter, which may appeal to couples who prioritize a responsive mattress for sex. The Celliant-blend and PCM cover effectively keeps the surface cool by offsetting heat retention from the foam layers. Steady airflow through the coil layer provides additional thermoregulation.\nThe medium model is best suited for side and back sleepers up to 130 pounds, since these sleepers need a fair amount of cushioning to cradle the shoulders, hips, and spine. The medium firm model felt most comfortable to side sleepers over 130 pounds and back sleepers up to 230 pounds. The firm option earned its highest marks from stomach and back sleepers over 130 pounds.\nBear\u2019s 120-night sleep trial allows you ample time to test the Bear Elite Hybrid and decide whether it meets your needs. Should you decide to keep the mattress, you\u2019ll also qualify for a lifetime manufacturer\u2019s warranty.

Across all firmness options, the mattress is designed with cooling features that should keep the bed at a comfortable, cool temperature for hot sleepers.\nWhat It\u2019s Made of\nShoppers can choose between a medium soft (4), medium firm (6), and firm (7) version of the mattress. All models begin with a top layer of proprietary CopperFlex foam, which conforms to the body and provides targeted relief to areas of the body that need it most. This is followed by a TitanFlex foam layer, which balances additional contouring with a slightly bouncy feel. The medium soft and medium firm options then feature a 1-inch layer of memory foam, which enhances pressure relief, while the firm model uses a layer of VariFlex to give the bed a firmer feel. If you prefer more cushioning from your sleep surface, the optional \u201cCloud\u201d foam layer can be added to the top of your comfort system for an extra fee.\nUnderneath the comfort layers is a sturdy coil system zoned to offer stronger support to the lower back while relieving pressure in areas like the shoulders and hips. The cover is composed of a soft fabric infused with TitanCool, a phase change material (PCM) designed to keep the bed surface cool.\nHow It Performed\nGiven its thick foam comfort system, the Aurora Hybrid excels at relieving pressure in areas that are prone to painful pressure buildup at night. During tests, the two softer models earned especially high marks from back and side sleepers under 130 pounds. Side sleepers between 130 and 230 pounds also found these firmness levels comfortable, thanks to the even mix of cushioning for the shoulders and hips and support for the lower back. The firm model appealed most to back and stomach sleepers who weigh over 130 pounds. Hot sleepers found the bed very comfortable, thanks to air circulation through the coils and PCM in the cover.\nCustomers receive a 120-night sleep trial with their purchase, and Brooklyn Bedding offers a 10-year warranty with the mattress.

This hybrid model has a foam and coil design that cushions your body while still offering plenty of sturdiness to keep you well supported.\nWhat It\u2019s Made of\nThe surface of the mattress is quilted with an inch of memory foam infused with a cooling gel. This is followed by a thicker layer of TitanFlex foam, which contours to the body but less so than the memory foam. Beneath is a transition layer made of Energex foam with a firmer feel, followed by a thick layer of TitanCaliber coils that generate strong support. For an additional fee, you can add a GlacioTex Cooling Cover. This is made with phase change material that helps keep the surface cool.\nHow It Performed\nWith an overall medium firm (6) feel, the Titan Plus Luxe felt very supportive during our tests, while still offering pressure relief for areas like the shoulders and hips. If you need a lot of support but have a co-sleeper who favors strong pressure relief, this is a nice happy medium. This design felt comfortable for a wide range of testers on our team, though it was most comfortable for side sleepers who weighed over 230 pounds and back sleepers between 130 and 230 pounds.\nStrong coils reinforce the bed\u2019s perimeter, so we found the edges didn\u2019t sag much when we sat on them. Airflow through the coils helps reduce heat retention, so hot sleepers shouldn\u2019t overheat excessively. If you\u2019d like to ensure a cooler surface, you can always purchase the cooling panel.\nThe Titan Plus Luxe ships for free and comes with a 120-night sleep trial.

The premium materials offer more comfort than the average hybrid model, and they boast several certifications to ensure the bed is as eco-friendly as it is comfortable.\nWhat It\u2019s Made of\nThe mattress begins with a plush quilted Euro-top and organic cotton cover. Next is a layer of wool that cushions the body and serves as a fire retardant, followed by an additional wool layer. The wool enhances the plushness and regulates temperature thanks to the material\u2019s natural breathability. A Talalay latex layer balances contouring and bounce, while the sturdy steel coils provide sturdy support for your entire body. Extra reinforcement along the longer sides of the bed helps prevent sagging on the edges.\nThe cotton is GOTS-certified organic, the latex has certification from the eco-INSTITUT, and the entire mattress is GREENGUARD Gold-certified to show it has met rigorous health and safety standards.\nHow It Performed\nData-Driven Results You Can Trust\nOur team at Sleep Foundation relies on rigorous hands-on evaluations as well as years of experience in the sleep product industry. We understand that mattress comfort is largely dependent on individual needs and preferences, so our team includes all sleeping positions with different body types. This way, we can be inclusive of as many sleepers as possible in our California king mattress picks.\nHow Our Testing Process Works\nTo find the best California king beds, we performed various tests using special tools to measure pressure relief, temperature neutrality, and motion isolation. Our testers also sit, lie down, and move around on the mattress surface to evaluate firmness, support, and edge support. The top performers in our tests are reflected in the list of picks above.\nIf you\u2019re interested in learning more about our evaluation criteria, read our\u00a0product research methodology\u00a0below:\nmotion isolation\nMotion isolation refers to how well a mattress\u2019 materials absorb and reduce motion transfer across the surface. Mattresses with high marks in this category are most beneficial for couples and other co-sleepers.\ntemperature control\nTemperature neutrality is most important for hot sleepers and those living in warmer climates. Many mattresses use breathable materials that circulate more air, like coil support cores, latex, and cotton to combat overheating.\npressure relief\nMattresses can reduce pressure buildup in a sleeper\u2019s joints using thicker comfort layers to cradle pressure points. Comfort layers made from foam and latex tend to perform well in this category.\noff gassing\nOff-gassing refers to odors from volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions or other material smells. These odors usually release after a new mattress is unboxed, but they are temporary and relatively harmless.\nease of movement\nSleepers may prefer mattresses that allow them to change positions without restriction. Mattresses with more responsive materials like latex tend to facilitate more effortless movement throughout the night.\nedge support\nEdge support refers to the sturdiness of a mattress perimeter. Lack of reinforcement along the perimeter forces sleepers to lie closer to the center to avoid slipping.\nsex\nResponsive mattresses made with latex comfort systems or coil support cores typically rank highly for sex. These components also circulate more air, making them a good option for couples who tend to overheat.\nbody weight\nBody weight is crucial to determining your firmness and support needs, but sleeping position and general preferences are also important factors. Our picks based on body weight are subjective, so we encourage sleepers to test multiple firmness levels.\nDive Deeper \u2013 In-Depth Mattress Guides\nIf you\u2019re still not sure a California king mattress is the right choice for your needs, you can review our detailed recommendations broken down by size.\nBest Mattress by Size\nSee More\nWhat are the Main Differences Between a King and a California King?\nKing and California king size beds\u00a0differ in terms of their measurements\u00a0and how much space they take up. The two beds have the\u00a0following measurements:\nTaller people who tend to sleep stretched out might prefer the California king since it measures 7 feet in length. People with pets might also prefer the additional length, so pets can sleep comfortably at the end of the bed.\nThe size and shape of your bedroom can also influence which king size you prefer. The beds take up the following square footage:\nBedding is another factor to consider when choosing between a standard and California king. The standard king mattress is more common, so there are more bedding options for that size and it\u2019s likely easier to find low-cost bedding.\nWhat to Look For in a Mattress\nDifferent people need different characteristics in a mattress depending on their preferences, sleep position habits, and body weights. The following factors determine how a mattress feels to you, how long it will last, how well it supports you throughout the night, and more.\nTypes of Mattresses\nThere are five major mattress constructions on the market today: innerspring, foam, latex, hybrid (a combination of coils with foam or latex), and airbed. Generally, since the mattresses within each category are constructed similarly, they share commonalities and features.\nThat being said, there is plenty of variation within each mattress type category as well. Individual models of mattresses within a larger group fall across a spectrum in terms of quality, materials used, and performance.\nHybrid\nDefinition: Hybrid mattresses are an attempt to combine the best characteristics of different mattress types into a single bed. Hybrids contain a coil support core and comfort layers of either memory foam or latex. They are usually cooler and have stronger edge support than all-foam beds while providing more cushion than the average innerspring mattress.\nWidely Comfortable: California king mattress shoppers often share a bed with a partner, kids, or pets. Hybrids can be a good choice for bed sharing because they tend to stay temperature neutral due to airflow through the coil layer. Their feel is often a mix of responsiveness and conforming, which can be a good compromise for people with different preferences.\nInnerspring\nDefinition: Springs make up the support core of innerspring mattresses and create a bouncy, responsive bed. Innersprings tend to remain temperature neutral and provide a firm sleeping surface. As one of the oldest mattress technologies, innerspring mattresses are some of the most affordable beds available.\nCooling Firmness: Innerspring mattresses allow for a lot of airflow and, as a result, remain temperature neutral throughout the night. People who sleep hot or share a bed will find that an innerspring mattress doesn\u2019t trap heat the way some all-foam or hybrids might.\nLatex\nDefinition: Latex is made from natural or synthetic rubber and can be used in a mattress\u2019s support core, comfort layers, or both. Latex mattresses tend to be the longest lasting and can potentially last decades. Sleepers who enjoy a soft yet responsive mattress surface will be happy with a latex mattress.\nResponsive Comfort: Latex provides cushion and contouring without sinkage. People who share a bed can enjoy the softness of latex without worrying that they will sink too far into the bed or into each other.\nAirbed\nDefinition: Airbeds, not to be confused with inflatable air mattresses, are beds that use air chambers instead of coils, foam, or latex as their support core. Often, the air levels in the mattress can be controlled, allowing sleepers to instantly make their mattresses softer or firmer to meet their needs.\nAdjustable Support: Many airbeds have separate, adjustable firmness levels on each side of the bed, which is a major benefit to people who share a bed. If you fall in a different weight group or have different mattress preferences than your sleep partner, you could adjust only your side of the bed in many airbeds.\nFoam\nDefinition: Foam beds are known for the \u201chugging\u201d sensation of memory foam, though not all foam beds are extremely conforming. Foam makes up both the support core and comfort layers, although some beds have additional comfort layer materials as well. Foam beds can tend to trap heat, so many are constructed with infusions of cooling material to help sleepers stay temperature neutral.\nContouring Relief: Foam mattresses can be a good choice for people who share a bed with someone who prefers a different sleep position. Memory foam tends to provide the most cushion and pressure relief, and a well-constructed foam bed will be supportive of all sleep positions.\nLast Things to Consider When You\u2019re Buying a California King\nStill have questions?\nOur product experts have extensive experience testing just about every sleep product on the market.

Sleep Approved.\nGetting a good night\u2019s sleep is hard enough without having to worry about snoozy topics like foam density and coil tension. With that in mind, our product testing team has toiled over 4,000 sleep products (including 1,934 mattresses)\u00a0 in our Seattle-based Test Lab over the past eight years so sleepers like you can rest easier.\nWhat we\u2019ve learned by going under covers has dictated how and why we test what we do, what we look for in a bed and a bed company, and which tools and products can ultimately lead to better sleep.\nAs product experts and self-proclaimed sleep nerds who find tactile joy in feeling fabric between our fingers, monitoring real-time sleep data, and (yes!) jumping on beds, we stay up-to-date on the science of sleep and sleep-tech trends to provide data-backed recommendations that can change minds and make sweet dreams.\nIn our Test Lab you\u2019ll find tech to monitor things like heat retention, motion isolation, and pressure mapping, and you\u2019ll also see the occasional sleep-health expert drop by to adjust a firmness rating and offer pro tips on syncing the sleep environment with sleep hygiene.\nWe know sleep is highly subjective, but our goal at the Test Lab is to help take the guesswork out of your sleep journey to lull you into your best-slept self.\nI guess you could say we\u2019re just that bed-icated to high-quality sleep.\nJump to: Welcome to the Test Lab | How We Test | Meet Our Product Testing Team | How We Rate Other Sleep Products\nWelcome to the Test Lab\nLocated in Sleep Foundation HQ, the Test Lab is stocked with hundreds of sleep products and state-of-the-art testing equipment. We evaluate each product using the same set of performance criteria, using a scale of 1-10 to rate mattress performance.\nHow We Rate Sleep Products\nOur overall ratings factor in qualitative insights from sleepers of different sizes and sleep positions, manufacturer specifications like firmness, price, and durability, and quantitative measurements across the six performance categories illustrated below.\nFirst, a few notes regarding manufacturer specifications. We reference firmness ratings from mattress companies, but designate our own ratings given performance criteria. We measure firmness on a scale of 1 (softest) to 10 (firmest). We generally don\u2019t recommend beds that rank below a 2 or above an 8, as they aren\u2019t great options for most sleepers. Learn more in\u00a0our guide to mattress firmness.\nWhen it comes to durability, the average lifespan of a mattress is 6-8 years. While we don\u2019t keep mattresses in the Test Lab for that long (we do bring them home for monthlong stretches, however), we do look closely at the quality of materials used in the construction of the bed to make general assumptions about its longevity. You can read more about\u00a0how long a mattress should last\u00a0on this page.\nThe products featured on our site have MSRPs that fall within ranges we would expect to see across similar categories and models. Actual pricing may fluctuate based on deals and sales.\nHow We Test Mattresses\nOver the years, we\u2019ve heard tons of different things from sleepers about what they look for in a bed, and the majority of it boils down to feel. Is it supportive? Does it sleep hot? Can I easily get in and out of it? Since not everyone can or wants to hop down to their local mattress retailer to lay on beds, we created the below criteria to test and quantify how a bed\u00a0feels.\nFor each of the tests, our foremost considerations are\u00a0sleeping position\u00a0and body weight, as the amount and distribution of weight on a mattress can affect how the mattress feels. Most individuals who weigh more than 230 pounds will have similar needs for a mattress in terms of firmness, thickness, and comfort layers. This holds true for sleepers under 130 and those who fall between that range.\nLearn More: How We Determine Body Weight Ratings\nWe rate each mattress we review for all sleeping positions (back, side, and stomach) on a scale of 1 (poor) to 10 (excellent). If you are a combination sleeper, assume that you need a mattress that scores highly in each position you sleep in.\nMotion Isolation\n/10\nMotion isolation refers to how much movement you can feel from the other side of the bed. A mattress that rates highly in this category allows you to keep sleeping when your partner is moving around or gets up before you do. We measure motion isolation with a vibrometer. This measures the intensity of vibrations across a mattress as a tester moves between sleeping positions.\nLearn More: How We Determine Motion Isolation Ratings\nTemperature Control\n/10\nWhile some luxury and high-tech beds offer active cooling or heating features, this test measures how well the materials inside the mattress stay temperature neutral throughout the night. This is especially important for sleepers who tend to wake up sweating. We measure this by placing a heating element on the mattress for an extended period of time, and then using a heat gun to measure how much heat the mattress retains after 5 minutes.\nLearn More: How We Determine Temperature Control Ratings\nPressure Relief\n/10\nYour body creates natural pressure points, like your hips and shoulders, where your weight is more concentrated. When you lay on a mattress, one that relieves pressure well will conform (contour) to your body, which helps to reduce pain and promote restful sleep. We test for pressure relief by placing a pressure pad on top of the mattress, having a tester lie on it, and measuring the amount of pressure on their hips and shoulders.\nLearn More: How We Determine Pressure Relief Ratings\nOdor Potential\n/10\nMost new mattresses emit chemical odors after unboxing. Most of these odors come from the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) found in synthetic foam. After unboxing each mattress, we use a VOC meter to measure the concentration of these compounds in the room at intervals of 10 minutes, one hour, three hours, and 24 hours, relative to a room with normal VOC levels.\nLearn More: How We Determine Odor Emissions Ratings\nEase of Movement\n/10\nGetting in and out of bed should be easy. If a bed rates poorly in this category, it generally means it\u2019s not a good choice for people with chronic pain or those who toss and turn a lot. We measure ease of movement through a number of subjective tests, and we also look at a mattress\u2019s response to pressure changes by placing a 15-pound kettlebell on its surface for a set amount of time and measuring how quickly the bed regains its original shape.\nLearn More: How We Determine Ease of Movement Ratings\nEdge Support\n/10\nMany people like to sleep close to the edge of their bed or use it as a place to sit to get ready in the morning, so it\u2019s important that a mattress can hold your weight and doesn\u2019t collapse around the edges. To test for edge support, testers sit and lay around the perimeter of the bed to see if compression increases over time. Then we place weights around the edges and measure the distance that the edge compresses downwards.\nLearn More: How We Determine Edge Support Ratings\nMeet Our Product Testing Team\nSit in on one of our spirited roundtable discussions about our favorite sheets, and you\u2019ll see that we mean it when we say we\u2019re sleep nerds.
