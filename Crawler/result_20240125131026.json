And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already won the Innovation Lion Grand Prix, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most respected benchmark for creative excellence.\nSee how his work will change the way we all work.\n1. Industry and academia are at a critical nexus.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Accessibility has oftentimes been seen as something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the technology landscape. But the opportunity is, I believe, seeing accessibility as a gateway to creativity and as a differentiator.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a university, a major automotive manufacturer, a computer developer or a soft drink company, there are opportunities right now, with torchbearers and leaders to reinterpret not only what accessibility was but what it can be to help truly bring delight and joy to so many people that haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to engage with products and brands because there has been inaccessibility, or there has been ableism. And those are things that hopefully we try to push off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n2. Enter inclusive design.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153My title wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t around five years ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still relatively new in the industry amongst peers and colleagues, both at VML as an agency as well as amongst our clients. So, being able to find those that are on the client side, whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Ford Motor Company or any other major global clients, hearing from individuals on those teams that are passionate about disability and inclusion and bring epiphanies to other people who maybe aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as embedded in accessibility, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly a powerful paradigm and fulcrum shift to see that.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Being able to translate those insights into momentum in accessible and inclusive designed advertising campaigns, omnichannel communications, retail experiences and innovations is something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n3. The societal impact.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Professionally, businesses are actioning on disability inclusion where even just a few years ago, they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t.

        "raw_content": "More From Forbes\nMy Top 10 Revolutionary Discoveries At CES 2024: AI, Robotics, Web3\nLisa Martin and Sandy Carter on CES Live\nThe Consumer Electronics Show (CES) is more than an event; it's a crystal ball into the technological marvels that will shape our world in the next half-decade. This year's CES, a melting pot of over 135,000 technology enthusiasts and innovators, showcased over 4,300 exhibits that spanned the spectrum of human ingenuity.\nHere's a snapshot of my top ten groundbreaking favorites:\nThe FQ Women Walk the Floor\nThe event at CES by Female Quotient was a powerful testament to women's growing influence in technology. It provided a platform where a diverse group of leaders \u2013 from visionary C-Suite executives to groundbreaking female founders and tech giants \u2013 converged to share their insights. They discussed strategies and initiatives aimed at narrowing the gender gap within the industry.\nWomen Walk the Floor at CES\n\u201cWe are all about creating a space and culture where we all feel welcome and like we belong. Here we all are walking the CES floor together, the most amazing thing we could possibly imagine because a woman alone has power but collectively, we have impact.\" - Shelley Zalis, Founder & CEO of The Female Quotient at the 2024 Women Walk the Floor Tour at CES. This is a significant milestone in our journey toward a more inclusive industry, making it a crucial highlight of my list.\nHydrogen Powered 18-Wheelers (or Class 8 Semi-Trucks)\nThe convention center was abuzz with the sight of Nikola 's Class 8 zero-emission truck, a progressive innovation that marks a new chapter in sustainable transport with hydrogen-powered fuel cells. The zero-emission semi-trucks, with a remarkable range of up to 500 miles, signify a leap towards a greener future. Pedro Garcia's insights on their developmental journey, which included extensive applications of the virtual world of Altair's simulations and data analytics tools, provided a fascinating narrative on how these behemoths transitioned from digital prototypes to the tarmac. \u201c\"At CES, as the industry discussed hydrogen's role in the future of transportation, the sight of the Nikola hydrogen fuel cell electric truck in action on the roads around the convention center affirmed 2024 promises to be a pivotal year for the transportation industry and especially Nikola,\" said Pedro Garcia, Nikola Global Head of Product Development. \"In showcasing the operational capabilities of our Class 8 zero-emission truck that is in production and being delivered to customers, we brought the future to life. Here's to an inspiring journey ahead, as we contribute to a more sustainable and innovative tomorrow.\" This innovation is a harbinger of the hydrogen economy, securing its spot on my list.\nPedro Garcia in front of the Nikola Hydrogen Powered 18 Wheeler at CES\nBest High-Yield Savings Accounts Of September 2023\nBest 5% Interest Savings Accounts of September 2023\nDeep Orange 14 from Clemson University\nThis year, the Deep Orange 14 autonomous vehicle, a product of Clemson University's bright minds, was a beacon of hope for disaster-stricken areas. The collaboration with the U.S. Army culminated in a vehicle that can navigate treacherous terrains to deliver aid without endangering human lives. This marvel of engineering, with over 900 parameters under constant surveillance, is at the forefront of autonomous research and deserves its acclaim for pushing the boundaries of technology for the greater good.\nDeep Orange 14 from Clemson University\nFlux Web3 Decentralized Cloud\nAmidst the clamor for genuine decentralization, the Flux Cloud emerged as a paradigm shift for developers seeking to build on a truly decentralized web3 infrastructure. This platform is a cornerstone for future applications, promising an escape from the centralized grip of web2. According to Blockworks, more of the world\u2019s largest Web2 game companies will embrace web3 in 2024. And per web3 statistics, projections indicate that the web3 industry could reach a valuation of approximately $14.5 trillion by 2030 and up to $11 trillion by 2024. Its potential for enhancing scalability, flexibility, and censorship resistance is why it's a key feature of my list.\nFlux Cloud at CES\nTransparent TVs by LG\nThe magic of LG's Signature OLED T was easily seen as it seamlessly transitioned between transparency and vivid display in the midst of ooos and ahhs! This year, LG's promise to commercialize the 77-inch wonder is a bold step towards redefining the aesthetic of living spaces. It's a statement of elegant functionality and serves as a window to a world where technology and design converge in harmony. Its inclusion on my list is due to its visionary approach to home entertainment.\nTransparent TV with Sandy Carter, COO\nAI from Pets to Pores to Pebbles\nAI's omnipresence at CES was emphatically showcased in applications ranging from pet health to personal wellness. The Invoxia Minitailz struck a chord with pet lovers, offering a glimpse into the well-being of our furry companions through advanced biometric tracking. Meanwhile, the Calm Stone's novel approach to stress reduction through AI-assisted breathing exercises represented a new frontier in personal health tech. In addition, Loreal introduced the Giorgio Armani Meta Profiler. The Meta Profiler's use of AI for analyzing skin health was another standout, illustrating AI's potential to tailor and enhance the retail experience. This diverse application of AI across various facets of life is why it's integral to my list.\nThe Calm Stone\nRobotics in Pools and PT\nRobotics were everywhere too! \u201cLanguage models aren\u2019t just for IoT anymore. Given the ease with which interfaces like ChatGPT can interpret prompts into commands, there will be a new class of tools emerging that seeks to combine the best of natural language processing and perception hardware,\u201d said Brandon Minor, co-founder and CEO of Tangram Vision said while speaking to the Robot Report. \u201cThis feels like a natural extension from an engineer\u2019s point of view, and success would add a layer of \u2018magic\u2019 to any tech demo.\u201d And we saw some magic too! The Aiper Scuba Series redefines pool maintenance with its cordless robotic cleaners. But in the robotics area, what caught my attention at CES was WiRobotics. This nifty device acts like a mini exoskeleton for your lower body, providing subtle, motorized assistance that helps with walking.\nYong-Jae Kim - Founder, CEO - WIRobotics and Sandy Carter, COO Unstoppable\nIts design is cleverly intuitive\u2014a belt pack equipped with retractable robotic arms that support and enhance leg movements. It's a godsend for physical therapy patients, aiding in movement and improving balance without being obtrusive. When I tested it, the difference was noticeable; my strides felt lighter and I was able to walk with increased speed. Priced at $2,300, the WiRobotics is an investment in health, claiming to reduce the energy required for walking by 20%. It's a standout addition to my list because of its potential to revolutionize recovery times, making it an essential tool for those on the path to regaining their mobility.\nThe Emergence of AI Companionship \u2013 Introducing Wehead\nAt this year's CES, a notable innovation was introduced by an American startup: Wehead. This groundbreaking AI companion robot presents a human-like face on a screen, forging a new frontier in digital interaction. My experience with Wehead was remarkable, engaging in conversation with an AI that seemed almost human. The developers designed it with a noble purpose: to offer companionship to those who might feel isolated or lonely.\nReflecting on George Ritzer's analysis in 'The McDonaldization of Society', Wehead stands in stark contrast to the impersonal automation that has come to define modern services, like those of fast-food chains, which expedite efficiency at the cost of human interaction.\nWeHead - Virtual Companion\nWehead aims to restore some of that lost connection, providing a 'face' and a 'voice' in scenarios where human contact is scarce. It's a poignant response to the social isolation prevalent in our fast-paced world and represents a meaningful use of technology to enhance human connection.\nThis is why Wehead has earned a place on my list \u2013 it's not just about the technology itself, but about how it can serve to alleviate the loneliness that touches so many lives.\nLongevity with the Phantom Neo by Bodyfriend\nThe Phantom Neo massage chair by BODYFRIEND represents a leap in health and wellness technology. By integrating PEMF (Pulsed Electromagnetic Field) technology, this chair doesn't just offer relaxation but a daily therapeutic regimen, potentially extending the 'Healthy Life Year' of users. Its revolutionary approach to daily well-being is why it's featured on my list.\nBodyfriend\nVirtual Content Creation.\nSony turned my head at CES with its integration of Smode XR technology. Smode XR harnesses the power of extended reality (XR) to meld the physical with the virtual, opening up a world of possibilities for virtual production shoots and live events. I saw a mini movie being made with real-time compositing, integrating to create stunningly immersive virtual environments, showcasing video of larger views than were shown in a real life picture. The potential of Smode XR in transforming television production, film, and live performances is immense, promising a new era of entertainment that is as limitless as the imagination of its creators. This innovation made my list because I think that creators are the future economy!\nThe Future of Content Production\nInnovate.\nAt the end of CES 2024 , these ten innovations stand as beacons of progress, each with the potential to redefine aspects of our lives. However, my iphone is filled with so many innovations from too many companies to mention. From fostering diversity to propelling sustainable transportation, from enhancing personal health to providing companionship, the future is being shaped today.\nAnd as I reflect on the showcases that left an indelible mark on me, I'm filled with anticipation for what the next year's CES will reveal about our path forward. You must join me next year!"

The stage for another decade of success is set, as the program has earned numerous awards, including:\n- #4 Graduate Entrepreneurship Program in the South by The Princeton Review, 2023\n- #1 Online MBA in South Carolina by Online MBA Report, 2023\n- #17 Hybrid/Online MBA Business Analytics Program by The Princeton Review, 2022\n- Top 10 World\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Best MBA Programs for Entrepreneurship by Poets&Quants, 2024\n- Top 50 In-Person MBA Nationally by The Princeton Review, 2023\nAdditionally, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s earned a reputation as one of the top 25 online MBA programs in the U.S., the top 5 in the South and the number one in South Carolina, with more than 94% of graduates landing employment just three months after graduation.\nView more on our decade of success at Greenville ONE: http://go.tig.rs/ufbonl.\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n207,708 followers\nLife after Clemson.\u00c2\u00a0\u00f0\u0178\u00a7\u2018\u00f0\u0178\u00a6\u00af\nAs global head of inclusive design at VML.\nJosh Loebner, PhD \u00e2\u20ac\u212222 is carving a new path at the top of one of the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most powerful advertising and marketing groups, leading the ad industry\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first Inclusive Experience Practice. And he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s already won the Innovation Lion Grand Prix, the world\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s most respected benchmark for creative excellence.\nSee how his work will change the way we all work.\n1. Industry and academia are at a critical nexus.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Accessibility has oftentimes been seen as something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s part of the technology landscape. But the opportunity is, I believe, seeing accessibility as a gateway to creativity and as a differentiator.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a university, a major automotive manufacturer, a computer developer or a soft drink company, there are opportunities right now, with torchbearers and leaders to reinterpret not only what accessibility was but what it can be to help truly bring delight and joy to so many people that haven\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t been able to engage with products and brands because there has been inaccessibility, or there has been ableism. And those are things that hopefully we try to push off.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n2. Enter inclusive design.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153My title wasn\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t around five years ago. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s still relatively new in the industry amongst peers and colleagues, both at VML as an agency as well as amongst our clients. So, being able to find those that are on the client side, whether it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s with Microsoft, Coca-Cola, Ford Motor Company or any other major global clients, hearing from individuals on those teams that are passionate about disability and inclusion and bring epiphanies to other people who maybe aren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t as embedded in accessibility, it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s truly a powerful paradigm and fulcrum shift to see that.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Being able to translate those insights into momentum in accessible and inclusive designed advertising campaigns, omnichannel communications, retail experiences and innovations is something that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s powerful.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\n3. The societal impact.\n\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Professionally, businesses are actioning on disability inclusion where even just a few years ago, they weren\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t. So, this is truly phenomenal.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd\nTo view or add a comment, sign in\n207,708 followers\nGiovanni Orlandi is the second student in the University's history to win the Churchill Scholarship!

Of all the gadgets, apps, and concepts on display, we have found this collection of products to be exemplary. These things are fun, they are useful, and they solve a particular problem by using technology in a new way. They may exhibit smart design or groundbreaking feats of engineering. Or the product's creator may have simply seen the future and was able to realize it in an object you can touch, hold, ride, or wear. This is the best of CES 2024.\nBest Health Tech: Vivoo at Home UTI Diagnostic Test\nIf you\u2019re a woman, getting a urinary tract infection is one of life\u2019s more common and miserable afflictions. Six out of 10 adult women experience them. It burns when you pee, and the infection travels up to your kidneys, then you have to pee all the time. Health tech company Vivoo follows up on the success of last year\u2019s smart toilet gadget with an at-home UTI diagnostic test kit. If you suspect you have a UTI, instead of scheduling a doctor\u2019s appointment and peeing in a cup, you download the app, pee on a stick, and scan the strip with your phone. Vivoo\u2019s deep learning image processing helps determine the results, which you can then send to your doctor to get a prescription to clear up the infection, as well as some necessary and immediate relief. The company also offers vaginal pH test strips so that you can be proactive about preventing future infections. The tests are currently awaiting FDA clearance, but later this year they will be available for next-day delivery via Amazon and other online retailers. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Smart Home: Eureka Dual Washing Bot\nNo one has ever said, \u201cI wish my washer, dryer, robot vacuum, and robot mop were all in one device.\u201d But once you\u2019ve seen this domestic mashup, you can never unsee it. And you will want it to be a part of your life; the combination of several large, bulky cleaning appliances in one convenient location makes a lot of sense. Eureka\u2019s robot vacuum lives in the pedestal beneath the combo washer-dryer unit, and it comes out of hiding to clean the floors. The robovac has all the advanced AI dirt detection smarts you\u2019d expect, but the real innovation here is purely mechanical. The robot mop\u2019s dirty water tank drains into the same pipe as the washing machine. With one fell swoop, you solve time, energy, space, and the hassle of having to empty stinky floor-cleaning water into a sink. Right now, this bot combo is only available in China due to a licensing issue with the name by which the company wants to sell it in North America. But when it does become available in the United States, we\u2019ll be jumping on that washing, drying, robot vacuuming and mopping train, too.\u2014Adrienne So\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Camera: Abode Edge Camera\nAbode\u2019s brand-new security camera caught our attention at CES for one big reason: its crazy W-Fi range. The Abode Edge Camera has a Wi-Fi HaLow system made by Morse Micro, giving it over a mile of wireless range. Your mileage may (literally) vary depending on your property\u2019s environment, of course. But instead of attaching the security camera to the outside of your home to get it as close to the Wi-Fi router as possible, you can simply connect the base station to your Wi-Fi network, then place the camera anywhere on your property and mount it facing your home instead of away from it, giving you a better view of your whole house. A six-month battery gives you the freedom to put it whenever suits you best without worrying about a power source. The camera has object detection to distinguish things like packages, pets, and people. It also has face recognition to identify known visitors. You can program it to only alert you about certain things, or faces it doesn\u2019t recognize. The Abode Edge will be available within the next few months for $199. Abode is also launching a single-camera subscription plan at $4 a month to access the AI features and up to 10 days of footage. \u2014Nena Farrell\nBest Transportation: Supernal S-A2\nNormally we'd run a mile for saying the best transportation reveal at CES was a flying car. But here we are. Supernal's eVTOL, the S-A2, is clearly much more than a pipe dream for the company, a division of the Hyundai Motor Group. If Supernal is true to its word, you'll see this all-electric pilot-plus-four-passenger vehicle in the skies in just four years time, whisking people over distances of 25 to 40 miles at max speeds of 120 mph at up to 1,500 feet above the ground. Not only is the design striking (and honed using biomimicry based on, of all things, the shapes of bees), it's apparently going to be almost unfathomably quiet. In the vertical takeoff and landing phases, it clocks at 65 dB, which is less noisy than your dishwasher. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Outdoors: Milo Action Communicator\nIf you\u2019ve ever gone skiing or backpacking in a group, you know that the worst part of the day is when you\u2019re supposed to meet up at the end and someone has wandered off. There you are, tired, cold, and grouchy, with no idea if your friend is just being slow, if they\u2019ve died, or if they are simply dawdling while looking at a lizard. Milo reimagines the old familiar walkie talkie as a modern voice communication platform for small groups. Clip a palm-sized device to the outside of your jacket or backpack strap, then chat freely without worrying about clicking the right button or finding the right frequency. Milo is hands-free and phone-free, and MiloAI will talk to you when you need hands-free help fast\u2014e.g. \u201cAlex is in range,\u201d or \u201cHey Milo, talk to Sara\u201d. Milo can send and receive signals to other units up to 5,000 feet\u00a0away in clear terrain, which is nearly a mile. The battery lasts all day on a single charge, and you can use either Bluetooth or a wired headset to listen and to chat. It\u2019s the only thing better than having to choose between hiking or having friends. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Weird: Looking Glass Go\nBrooklyn-based Looking Glass has been creating holographic displays for years, and its latest version is a compact 6-inch digital frame called the Looking Glass Go. The screen is sharper and thinner than ever, and you can load spatial photos or 3D holograms onto it. You can even chat with 3D characters from Looking Glass\u2019 Lifeforms app on the display. But what\u2019s especially notable is the ability to add any 2D photo\u2014even those from a Polaroid\u2014and have it still deliver an incredible 3D effect on the display. This feat is possible thanks to a smart use of generative AI, which the Go uses to fill in the edges of a 2D image to give it that extra depth and make it look holographic. It\u2019s quirky, and largely a fun little gizmo to play around with (that costs $300), but much like Google\u2019s Project Starline, Looking Glass Go drums up a world where our screens aren\u2019t just flat and boring. And it does this without asking you to don annoying headsets. Yay! \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Parenting: Droyd Venym Electric Scooterboard\nBefore I had kids, I never would have guessed how many ways my own offspring would find to scoot and slide across everything. Forget bikes and scooters, they will literally slide down hills on cardboard or spin around on the floor in mixing bowls. Toy manufacturer Droyd\u2019s electric scooterboard is quite the upgrade. It\u2019s an electric version of a popular toy that consists of a sit-on panel with handles and spinny wheels. (I\u2019m not proud that I know this, but I do.) Droyd\u2019s version is intended for kids 4 and up. It looks a lot like a tarantula, all black with four spindly legs. It also comes with stickers so your kid can personalize it and make it look a tad less fearsome. Your child can control dual motors with two push-button accelerators. If it looks and seems kind of dangerous, don\u2019t worry: it\u2019s speed-capped at 3 mph. All it can do is make your kid a little dizzy and a lot delighted. \u2014Adrienne So\nBest Software: Apostrophy OS\nThere\u2019s a new mobile operating system in town called Apostrophy OS, and it just debuted on the MC02, a $750 smartphone from the Swiss electronics company Punkt. Based on GrapheneOS, which is itself based on Android, Apostrophy replaces every element of Google\u2019s presence from the software, giving you a a privacy-focused alternative to Android that also doesn\u2019t sit in a completely walled garden like Apple\u2019s iPhone. Since Apostrophy isn\u2019t collecting or selling your data, you will need to pay a $15 monthly subscription to use the OS (it\u2019s free for the first year), but you\u2019re paying for the peace of mind. Every part of Apostrophy is built and operated out of Switzerland too, from the built-in VPN to the pre-installed apps like the email client and calendar. The company says Punkt is its first device partner, but it has already signed up another manufacturer, which will debut a device later this year. We\u2019ve seen companies come and go at trying to offer a more privacy-focused version of Android, but they\u2019ve almost all faltered when it came to apps\u2014if you can\u2019t use the apps available on Android and iOS, you\u2019re doomed to obscurity. Apostrophy knows this, so it offers an app store based on the F-Droid open source app store with access to a limited number of vetted apps like Signal. There\u2019s also a built-in wizard that helps you add the Google Play Store and Google Services Framework, enabling you to run any Android app you want. These apps are all sandboxed, meaning the underlying system access Google enjoys with Android isn't present here. (App developers will still be able to gather data about your app usage, but it\u2019s restricted to their own apps.) The handset itself seems fairly simple, with a 6.7-inch screen, a 5,500-mAh battery, and 6 GB of RAM. There\u2019s a 64-megapixel primary camera, but I expect the photos it captures aren\u2019t going to wow you. The good news is we won\u2019t have to wait long to see what the full experience is like\u2014the MC02 ships in the next four weeks and you can order it now. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest Mobile: Clicks\nMiss the days of the physical keyboard on your smartphone? A handful of companies over the years have tried to bring a BlackBerry-esque smartphone experience back\u2014even Blackberry itself. Turns out, that might not be the right approach. Enter Clicks Technology, a company formed by people that have never stopped dreaming about buttons, including YouTube gadget reviewer Michael Fisher, better known as MrMobile, and folks from fxtech, which has previously made Android phones with slide-out keyboards. Clicks is a case that adds a physical QWERTY keyboard to the iPhone. It makes for a long phone, but it\u2019s cute and it has backlit keys! The beauty of Clicks is how the iPhone\u2019s virtual keyboard never pops up unless you force it to, giving valuable screen real estate back to you as you type. Mac and iPad keyboard shortcuts are supported too. Typing on Clicks certainly felt fun, but the more I used it, it's the shortcuts that really started to win me over. The case is available only for the iPhone 14 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro, and iPhone 15 Pro Max, costing between $139 and $159 depending on the model, and you can order it now. Select models start shipping in February. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Home Theater: LG CineBeam Qube\nOne trend from CES this year has been huge TVs, so it\u2019s refreshing to see LG come up with a solution to ever-expanding inches with a projector that is so dinky, and so nicely designed, that it could well be a character in one of the Disney animated films you can play through it. To give you a mental picture of how small the CineBeam Qube is, it measures just over 3 inches thick and 5.3 inches tall and deep. The Qube can throw out 4K images from 50 up to 120 inches, has a 450,000:1 contrast ratio, auto screen adjustment with auto-focus, and can display \u201cdigital images that enhance the ambience of the space\u201d if you want it on when not watching it. Brightness is a little low, though, with a modest 500-lumen, so get ready to turn down the lights on movie nights. Speaking of which, yes, you can hook up the usual streaming services via LG\u2019s webOS or use the HDMI eARC or USB C ports. Audio is built-in via a 3-watt mono speaker. But it\u2019s all about that diminutive, attractive design, isn\u2019t it? Oh, and see that handle? It can rotate 360 degrees so you can carry the 3.3-pound projector from room to room. Smart, small, stylish. No price yet. \u2014Jeremy White\nMichael Calore\nGear Team\nElana Klein\nMichael Calore\nBest PC: Lenovo ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid\nLenovo showed off 40 or so new products at CES 2024, but the ThinkBook Plus Gen 5 Hybrid was the coolest things we saw from the brand, and the coolest PC overall. This looks like an ordinary Windows laptop, but you can actually pull the entire display off the keyboard. When you do, that screen immediately turn into an Android 13 tablet. Meanwhile, if you connect the keyboard to an external monitor, you can continue using Windows since all of the Windows computing components are housed in the keyboard half of the assembly. There\u2019s also a button on the keyboard to switch the operating system between Android and Windows when the screen is docked so you can use Android with a keyboard and trackpad too. We\u2019ve seen a lot of 2-in-1 laptop designs over the years but this one is unique and streamlined. It\u2019ll cost roughly around $2,000 and will go on sale in the second quarter of the year. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nBest Accessory: Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit\nAt CES there was a near endless number of Qi2 wireless chargers, but the mobile accessory that left a lasting impression was Belkin\u2019s Auto-Tracking Stand Pro With DockKit ($180). This MagSafe charger for the iPhone launches very soon and doubles as a 360-degree swiveling tripod for your iPhone\u2019s camera. The hook here is that you don\u2019t have to do anything to make sure you\u2019re always framed properly in the shot. It\u2019s one of the first products to support Apple\u2019s Works With DockKit program, and this allows the Stand Pro to pair with the iPhone\u2019s camera via NFC. After pairing, the device will swivel to always try and keep you in the frame, whether you\u2019re using the rear or selfie camera. It also doesn\u2019t matter which app you\u2019re using to access the camera. You can dock the iPhone and start a presentation in Microsoft Teams or you can start filming a dance on Instagram Stories and move around the room with no worries of not being in the scene. It can be plugged into the wall or run off a battery for around five hours. We\u2019ve seen this kind of subject-tracking tech seep into laptops, webcams, iPads, and smart displays. Soon we\u2019ll stop asking our friends to film us and just start doing everything ourselves by using stuff like this. \u2014Julian Chokkattu\nGear Team\nJulian Chokkattu\nSimon Hill\nMichael Calore\nElana Klein\nSimon Hill\nParker Hall\nAdrienne So\nWIRED COUPONS\nTurboTax coupon code: 10% off DIY tax software\nH&R Block tax software: Save 20% - no coupon needed\nInstacart Promo Code: Save $50 on Your Order\nExtra 20% Off sitewide - Dyson promo code\nCapture More Savings: up to 20% off all GoPro cameras\n+30% Off with your Samsung promo code\nMore From WIRED\nReviews and Guides\n\u00a9 2024 Cond\u00e9 Nast.

        "raw_content": "Copyright \u00a9 2024, Quiller Media, Inc.\nContact Us | Privacy Policy\nHere are the best new devices from CES Unveiled 2024\nCES Unveiled 2024\nOn Sunday, CES 2024 kicked off with its annual Unveiled media event that highlights various brands launching new products for the coming year. AppleInsider was on the ground for the event, and here are our favorite products to be announced.\nThere will be much more to see throughout CES, but Unveiled is a great start to the massive technology show. Current trends include many Qi2 devices, Matter support for vacuums, and lots of new connected devices.\nDreameBot X30 Ultra smart vacuum\nDreame was at CES showing off its latest vacuum, which has a few neat tricks that aim to solve a few of the biggest pain points for robotic vacuums.\nFirst, the company is offering a new add-on blade attachment that will even work with select existing vacuums. This brush head uses its built-in blades to shred hair as it is sucked up before delivering it to the dustbin.\nAccording to Dreame, this new brush design will prevent 100 percent of tangles that exist today. They gave us a demo on the show floor by feeding in pet hair that was quickly swept away.\nThe second innovation is a new attachment for the bottom of its auto-empty docking station. It has squeegees that move and clean the bottom of the docking station so that users will never have to clean it themselves.\nExoBrew home beer brewer\nComing to the US this year is the ExoBrew home beer brewing machine. It's an all-in-one brewer that cuts out all of the mess and hassle that typically accompanies home brewing \u2014\nplus it removes most of the pungent smell.\nUsers have full control over the beer they brew, choosing either a ready-to-go kit that has everything included or shopping at a local brewer supply shop and creating their own flavors.\nIt's powered by the company's app that walks you through every step of the process. The app is also great for beer discovery, helping you identify beers you like based on the flavor profiles you select.\nWithings BeamO home checkup\nGoing beyond a thermometer, the new Withings BeamO is the ultimate tool for an at-home wellness checkup. This singular device has multiple sensors, allowing you to use it as a stethoscope, SpO2 sensor, ECG, and thermometer.\nResults are displayed on BeamO's colorful LCD display and uploaded via Wi-Fi to the company's app. The app syncs through the Apple Health app like its other connected health products.\nWhen doing a Telehealth appointment, you can share the tests with your doctor in real-time. If you take them on your own, you can share them with your family or your doctor, including ECG results and audio recordings of your heart and lungs.\nIt's currently pending FDA approval before its US rollout.\nGovee smart lights\nAfter withholding support for Apple Home for the longest time, Govee is now adding support by way of Matter. At CES 2024, the smart home brand has several new lighting products including an updated AI sync box and second-generation neon light strip.\nThe Matter-enabled neon light strip has multiple addressable zones for great control, is made of a new, more flexible material, and has new clips that make it easier to shape into any picture you want.\nFor the sync box, it has improved AI analytics that allows it to show cool lighting effects based on the game you're playing on-screen. Instead of reacting to the colors, it is able to react to what you do, like scoring a goal or eliminating an enemy.\nUgreen NAS\nExpanding its portfolio from power supplies and batteries, Ugreen is showing off its new collection of network-attached storage devices.\nThere is a range of devices that go from a two-bay drive to an eight-bay design. They have various ports on them, including front-facing upstream and downstream Thunderbolt 4 ports, an SD card reader, and several USB-A.\nOn the back is HDMI output for multimedia usage. These new drives are powered by Intel processors on the inside and are designed to be some of the fastest on the market, including 10Gb Ethernet.\nUgreen also has a more portable NAS that can hold up to four NVMe SSD modules and can double as a docking station, but it has built-in Wi-Fi for creatives on the go.\nThe new lineup will be available this spring.\nMui Board Gen 2 Matter controller\nAfter demoing various versions of its products over the last two years, Mui is finally ready to start selling its second-generation wooden smart controller. It is now live on Kickstarter for backers.\nThe Mui Board 2 has a Matter certification already completed and will allow it to set various scenes or control any of your Matter devices in your home, from lights to thermostats.\nIt can also display different information on your smart home, such as sensor statuses, weather, and more.\nJ5create Thunderbolt 5 dock\nThere are few Thunderbolt 5 host devices on the market, and no Apple ones yet, but we saw a few docks start to show up here at CES.\nOne of the first we ran across was from J5create. The front of the dock has an audio output, USB-A port, two Thunderbolt ports, and SD/microSD card readers.\nThe back has two more Thunderbolt ports, two USB-A ports, and a 2.5Gb Ethernet port.\nThere's no firm release date or price, but J5create expects it to be available later this year.\nXgimi IMAX 4K projector\nSmart projector purveyor Xgimi has a gorgeous new device that it is showing off this year. It's a 4K smart projector that can move on its own to find the best wall and angle when set up in your home. It is able to rotate and tilt to get the best positioning.\nIt's also IMAX-enhanced for exceptional picture quality when watching your content. Like Xgimi's other projectors, it supports Apple AirPlay.\nAround the back, it has several ports, including two HDMI and two USB-A. We'd have preferred USB-C ports, but we still appreciate the IO.\nIt has a very unique appearance that matches high-end home theater systems. There are wooden slats along the front and sleek silver down the sides.\nTargus Ergo Flip Mouse\nContinuing its eco-friendly push, Targus has a new range of bags that are created from ocean-bound plastics. They felt great, but what struck us was its new innovation, an award-winning mouse.\nThe Ergo Flip looks like your typical ergonomic mouse, but the top is held in place magnetically. You can just lift it up, rotate it 90 degrees, and turn it into a left-handed mouse.\nThis is the only mouse on the market that is able to move from left-handed to right-handed so quickly. It was seamless and is great for multi-use locations where there may be left or right-handed users.\nHyper Magsafe, Qi2, & Thunderbolt 5\nThere were too many products on display at Hyper's booth to touch on here (but we covered them all already). Just the same, we wanted to highlight our favorite few here.\nLike many others, Hyper has an expansive lineup of Qi2 accessories coming to market. The one that jumped out to us, though, was an updated version of its existing 4-in-1 charger.\nIt has an adjustable Qi2 puck, a fast charging Apple Watch puck, and two lower Qi chargers for smaller devices. Plus, it folds in half for travel.\nWe also took a look at its new tool-less MagSafe SSD enclosure. This new Hyper MagSafe SSD can magnetically connect to your iPhone 15 Pro or iPhone 15 Pro Max and connect via USB-C.\nThere's a second USB-C PD input port so that you can power your iPhone at the same time. This could be a great solution for creators filming in ProRes format.\nHyper has its own Thunderbolt 5 dock too. It's very compact and is a slick, dark grey color that looks great in person.\nThe back of it has two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, an Ethernet port, and two Thunderbolt 5 ports. On the front is a CFExpress Type-B slot, a full-size SD card reader, a headphone jack, another USB 3.2 Gen 2 port, and a power button.\nInvoxia Minitailz smart collar\nThe latest version of Invoxia's smart dog collar is dubbed Minitailz, and it is much smaller than its predecessors. This means it will support more dogs than before.\nThis smart collar will monitor your pet's activity to help keep them healthy, can track their location via GPS should they run off, and can even detect AFib.\nIt connects to the Invoxia app, where you can subscribe for a monthly fee to track your pet's whereabouts.\nBelkin Qi2 & DockKit Auto Tracking Stand\nFinally, Belkin had a new array of Qi2 devices on display at Unveiled and the first product to use Apple DockKit.\nIt is offering three new Qi2 battery packs that have ranging capacities and built-in kickstands that work vertically or horizontally.\nThe popular BoostCharge Pro has been updated with Qi2, giving it a new sleeker look and USB-C power. It now has an adjustable puck instead of a fixed one.\nThe Belkin Auto-Tracking Stand Pro with DockKit stole the show, though. It pairs to any phone running iOS 17 with just a tap via NFC.\nOnce connected, it gives you a little bow and locks onto your face. It supports up to 10 users with the current version of DockKit.\nYou can move quickly all around thanks to its 360-degree range of motion. It is able to tilt up and down and works with the front and rear-facing cameras in portrait and landscape modes.\nIt will be available very soon for $179.99.\nBased in Columbus, Ohio, Andrew O'Hara has spent the last eight years embedded in all aspects of the digital space from leading digital marketing teams to front-end web development and design. He started producing vid...\n3 Comments\npulseimages\nWas hoping Nintendo would give more info on the upcoming Switch successor.\nbeowulfschmidt\nSeems more likely for them to hold their own event for that, especially now that E3 is history.\nlaytech\nAre those sponsored devices in that article as nothing interested me whatsoever.

        "raw_content": "Filed under:\nCES 2024: all the TVs, laptops, smart home gear, and more from the show floor\nBy\nJacob Kastrenakes, a deputy editor who oversees tech and news coverage. Since joining The Verge in 2012, he\u2019s published 5,000+ stories and is the founding editor of the creators desk.\nShare this story\nCES is where the tech industry rings in the new year. Each January, just about every corner of the industry shows up with announcements and previews that set the stage for the year to come. Expect news around laptops, TVs, smart home gadgets, transportation tech, gaming, smartphones, wearables, virtual reality, and a whole lot more.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off with a day of press conferences on Monday, January 8th, featuring Samsung, LG, Nvidia, Sony, and more. Then the show floor officially opens on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th in Las Vegas, Nevada.\nIt\u2019s going to be a busy week. There\u2019s likely to be a bunch of virtual reality news as companies race to compete with Apple\u2019s Vision Pro headset, smart home companies will continue to jam tech into more parts of our home (and hopefully get more organized in the process), and there\u2019s certain to be a wave of new laptops, tablets, and handhelds powered by a new series of mobile-friendly chips.\nAs always, The Verge\u2019s team will be on the ground covering the event\u2019s biggest news. You can tune in below to follow along with the latest.\nTODAY, Two hours ago\nThomas Ricker\nUnlike LG\u2019s transparent OLED TV, Sammy\u2019s transparent MicroLED display is still just a prototype, but it\u2019s the first time Samsung is showing it in public. As a reminder, MicroLED \u2014 first seen in\u00a0\u201cThe Wall\u201d at CES several years ago\u00a0\u2014 has many of the same benefits as OLED (like self-lit pixels) without the organic downsides or chance of burn-in. But MicroLED is still too expensive despite the seamless panels getting\u00a0smaller and more TV-like\u00a0in recent years.\nTODAY, 7:33 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nI\u2019ve looked through LG\u2019s new transparent OLED TV, and seen something special\nTransparent display prototypes have had a presence on the CES show floor for many years. They\u2019re a guaranteed way to wow people and showcase the unique capabilities of an OLED panel. But LG has seemingly decided that the time has come to ship a real, bonafide transparent TV that people will actually be able to buy this year. At some undisclosed date. For what\u2019s certain to be an exorbitant amount of money.\nThe company has announced the OLED Signature T (you can guess what the T stands for) here at CES 2024. The product that LG demoed for press in Las Vegas isn\u2019t exactly \u201cfinal.\u201d The 77-inch display won\u2019t be changing at all, but the company hasn\u2019t decided whether it\u2019ll come bundled with all the side furniture you see in these photos or if it\u2019ll sell those items separately.\nTODAY, 7:10 AM UTC\nThomas Ricker\nThe Signature OLED T \u2014\u00a0T for transparent \u2014 is a new 77-inch 4K TV that\u2019ll go on sale later this year. It\u2019s not the best TV for the money, but this is something you\u2019d buy just because you can.\nTODAY, 3:31 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nI\u2019m a sucker for Sharge\u2019s charging gear because it looks like nothing else, and that continues to be true of the new Sharge 170 model and especially the \u201cInternet Hostkey\u201d in my CES hands-on gallery below. Be warned that the Hostkey comes in a wimpy 40Wh capacity model in addition to its reasonable 72Wh one. Here\u2019s my video with a few earlier Sharge products.\n1/4\nTODAY, 3:30 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nI\u2019m at CES Unveiled, and the Palmplug is a neat little wearable glove. There\u2019s sensors on each finger for hand tracking, haptic feedback, and LED lights so you can have visual cues too.\nThere\u2019s a lot of potential applications (VR is an obvious one) but the one I found most interesting is TheraPlay. It pairs the Palmplug\u2019s hand tracking with a health tech game that helps stroke patients regain mobility. While the patient gets to play a game, their doctor gets metrics to see how recovery is going.\nTODAY, 3:16 AM UTC\nSean Hollister\nHere at CES 2024, Hyper, J5Create, and Belkin have items on display with the latest in docking and magnetic charging technology \u2014 but sadly, none of it is plugged in. Maybe because we\u2019re still waiting on Windows laptops and Android phones to adopt the tech. (There\u2019s nothing to dock yet, right?)\nI\u2019m seriously looking forward to 240W charging and 120Gbps speeds from my USB-C ports, though, not to mention a \u201cMagSafe for Android.\u201d\n1/11\nTODAY, 3:00 AM UTC\nChris Welch\nSamsung\u2019s new OLED TV could make annoying glare a thing of the past\nSamsung\u2019s third-generation QD-OLED TV, the new S95D, comes with a unique trick compared to its predecessors: it\u2019s got a glare-free display that the company claims all but eliminates any noticeable reflections. This should prevent annoying distractions when you\u2019re watching the TV on a sun-drenched day and trying to enjoy your content.\nAnti-reflective coatings are nothing new on high-end TVs \u2014 Samsung, LG, and Sony are all pretty good at them as it stands \u2014 but Samsung seems to have gone a step beyond that with the special panel treatment being used here, and it insists there are no negative impacts on viewing angle or color distortion as a result.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nEmma Roth\nBelkin made an iPhone dock that can track you around the room\nBelkin is releasing a motorized iPhone dock that swivels and tilts to track your movements while on camera. The device, called the Belkin Stand Pro, costs $179.99 and appears to be the first to adopt Apple\u2019s DockKit framework, allowing you to connect the device to your iPhone without having to install a third-party app.\nThe Stand Pro\u2019s cylindrical base is capable of rotating 360 degrees, while the MagSafe-equipped motorized arm can tilt up and down with 90 degrees of movement. Once you pop an iPhone 12 or newer onto the stand, you can pair it to your device with NFC. From there, you can open any app with a camera \u2014 like FaceTime, Instagram, TikTok, WhatsApp, or Microsoft Teams \u2014 and the dock will automatically shift the iPhone to keep you (or your subject) in frame when video chatting or filming.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nVictoria Song\nWithings\u2019 latest gadget combines a thermometer, pulse oximeter, EKG, and stethoscope\nWithings always shows up to CES with a futuristic health tech device in tow, and this year is no different. The company\u2019s latest gadget is the $249.95 BeamO, a so-called multiscope that measures your temperature, takes electrocardiograms, reads blood oxygen levels, and works as a stethoscope to monitor heart and lung health.\nThe device itself resembles some of Withings\u2019 other contactless thermometers, but it contains photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors, electrodes, a digital stethoscope, and a second-gen version of the infrared temperature sensor in the Withings Thermo. You\u2019re probably more familiar with PPG sensors as the green LED you find in most smartwatches that measures heart rate by shining light into the skin. The sides of the BeamO also have electrodes to enable EKG readings for atrial fibrillation detection.\nTODAY, 1:00 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe new $1,499 Freo X Ultra and $469 Freo X Plus vacuum mops showcased at CES can internally store collected dust within a disposable dust bag, compressing it down into tight parcels that won\u2019t need emptying for up to 60 days.\nIt\u2019s not quite self-emptying, but credit to Narwal for developing new ways to make automated cleaning tech even lazier.\nTODAY, 12:30 AM UTC\nJess Weatherbed\nThe tech accessory provider introduced a bunch of new products at CES that make use of the new MagSafe-like charging standard, such as the $149.99 HyperJuice 4-in-1 Qi2 Charging Stand and the $129.99 HyperJuice 10,000mAh Qi2 Power Bank.\nIt\u2019ll be a few weeks until they\u2019re available to purchase, but customers hunting for Qi2 products are already spoiled for choice given the numerous offerings already announced by brands like Nomad and Anker.\nJan 7\nJennifer Pattison Tuohy\nRobot vacuums are becoming impressively autonomous, but they still need our help to clean them, like when hair gets wrapped around their brushes. Dreame thinks it\u2019s solved this problem with a new automatic hair-cutting tool.\nThe Anti-Tangle Tricut brush cuts hairs wrapped around the brush, so you don\u2019t have to mess with those annoying knife tools.\nThe brush is debuting at CES 2024 along with the new $1,700 DreameBot X30 Ultra. Both are available for pre-order on February 28th, and the brush will be compatible with the excellent L20 Ultra.\nJan 7\nThomas Ricker\nXgimi launches its brightest projector yet, hides another inside a ceiling lamp\nXgimi has two new projectors for the US: its brightest ever 4K smart projector and a 3-in-1 unit that\u2019s also a ceiling light and Bluetooth speaker. Both long-throw projectors run Google TV.\nXgimi says its 4K Horizon Max can produce 3,100 ISO lumens from its \u201cDual Light 2.0\u201d laser and LED hybrid light source. It\u2019s worth noting, however, that Xgimi has admitted to overstating brightness scores by as much as 27 percent in the past \u2014 something it corrected only after facing a lawsuit from Epson.\nJan 7\nVictoria Song\nAcer is bringing its glasses-free 3D screen to a more affordable laptop\nDespite the pictures, I solemnly swear that, in person, that astronaut on the new Acer Aspire 3D 15 SpatialLabs Edition was reaching their arms out to me. I\u2019ve rolled my eyes at 3D displays before, but this time, it looked so realistic that I poked the astronaut\u2019s tummy like it was the Pillsbury Doughboy. I wasn\u2019t wearing glasses, and the whole thing was equal parts weird and cool. That\u2019s exactly the sort of thing you expect to see at CES 2024 on some far-out, high-end concept tech, but this 3D laptop is coming out next month for around the same price as a 15-inch M2 MacBook Air.\nTo be fair, $1,399 for a laptop isn\u2019t nothing \u2014 especially when you consider that\u2019s the starting price. However, it\u2019s pretty dang affordable as far as Acer\u2019s SpatialLabs devices go. Acer introduced its SpatialLabs 3D tech a while back on a ConceptD laptop for creators and then later to the Predator Helios 300. Those laptops are a whopping $3,500 and $4,000, respectively. This is the first time we\u2019ve seen a SpatialLabs laptop in this price range, which opens up the platform to more artists, developers, and creatives.\nJan 6\nThomas Ricker\nJackery\u2019s rooftop tent is also a powerful solar generator\nJackery has converted the humble rooftop tent into a powerful solar generator that lets any car escape the grid for a weekend or longer. Although it\u2019s just a concept on show at CES right now, Jackery says it will put the tent into production sometime near the end of 2024.\nThe retractable solar panels are said to produce up to 1000W when the car is parked and the tent is open and facing south. That\u2019s enough to generate 4.96kWh per day in the Western US, or 4kWh as you move east, according to Jackery\u2019s estimates. There\u2019s no mention of its resilience to wind, but that\u2019s hardly a concern for a concept parked on ugly carpet inside the Las Vegas Convention Center.\nJan 5\nTom Warren\nMSI\u2019s Steam Deck competitor has leaked, and it\u2019s powered by an Intel Meteor Lake chip\nMSI is reportedly readying a new handheld gaming PC to rival Valve\u2019s Steam Deck and competitors like the Asus ROG Ally and Lenovo Legion Go. After a brief teaser yesterday, pictures of MSI\u2019s Claw handheld have appeared on X (formerly Twitter), spotted by VideoCardz. (Yes, Claw is the actual name, so get your GIFs ready in the comments section.)\nThe Claw looks similar to Asus\u2019 ROG Ally, complete with offset thumbsticks with what appears to be RGB lighting. Leaked benchmarks suggest MSI\u2019s handheld will be powered by one of Intel\u2019s latest Meteor Lake processors, a surprise choice given both Lenovo and Asus opted for AMD\u2019s Ryzen Z1 Extreme processor instead.\nJan 5\nChris Welch, Andrew J. Hawkins\u00a0and\u00a05 more\nWhat to expect at CES 2024\nNo single event of the year delivers more tech news than CES. The annual trade show is the starting point for each year in tech, giving companies a chance to announce their next wave of products or tease the ambitious, far-out, and often strange new projects they\u2019ve been working on behind the scenes.\nThis year\u2019s show kicks off from Las Vegas on Tuesday, January 9th and runs through Friday, January 12th, but you should expect news to start coming out as soon as, really, right now. Companies have been trickling out announcements over the past week, and many will try to preempt the conference with announcements in the days before the show floor opens up.\nJan 5\nVictoria Song\nEnjoy talking to your new voice-controlled smart bidet\nFor most people, flushing $10,000 down the drain for an entire smart toilet is a bit much. But if you\u2019ve always wanted a fancy toilet, Kohler is kicking off CES 2024 with a more accessible option. The $2,149 PureWash E930 is a voice-controlled bidet seat that lets you transform your existing toilet into a much smarter one. As in, you can now boss your toilet around.\nThe appeal of bidet seats is that they let you turn your boring toilet into a much fancier one for a fraction of the price. Kohler\u2019s had bidet seats for years, but the difference with the PureWash E930 is that it has Amazon Alexa and Google Home compatibility, which means you can use your digital assistant of choice to activate the bidet spray, warm air dryer, and UV cleaning features. (And best of all, you don\u2019t have to touch anything.) It also works with the Kohler Konnect app so you can set your own preferences and presets.\nJan 5\nJay Peters\nTesla\u2019s first smart home partner is Samsung SmartThings\nAhead of CES 2024, Tesla and Samsung announced today that they\u2019re teaming up on energy management for smart homes. Users of Samsung\u2019s SmartThings platform will be able to connect to Tesla products like the Powerwall home battery so that you can keep track of things like energy production and your usage.\nWhen connected to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy can sync with the \u201cStorm Watch\u201d feature so that you\u2019re notified of heavy weather on a Samsung phone or TV, for example. In addition to the Powerwall, SmartThings Energy will be able to connect to other Tesla products, including its electric vehicles, Solar Inverter, and Wall Connector charging solutions.\nJan 4\nNathan Edwards\nRazer updates Blade 16 and 18 with new displays\nRazer is teasing a major set of display upgrades for the Blade 16 and Blade 18 gaming laptops ahead of a full unveiling of the updated laptops next week at CES.\nThe Blade 16 is getting what Razer says is the world\u2019s first 16-inch 240Hz OLED panel, co-developed with Samsung, while the Blade 18 will get a 165Hz 4K LED panel with G-Sync. Both panels will be Calman Verified and individually factory calibrated. Like the current Blade display options, they\u2019ll show 100 percent of the DCI-P3 gamut.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nBetween Asus, Lenovo, and now MSI, it feels like every major PC gaming brand is lining up to compete with Valve\u2019s Steam Deck. MSI\u2019s Instagram teaser for next week\u2019s CES announcement doesn\u2019t give too many hints about the specs or features of its competitor. But it does seem to confirm it\u2019ll have plenty of fan grills and RGB.\n1/3\nJan 4\nChris Welch\nSony is no longer abiding by the industry norm of announcing its latest and greatest TVs at CES each year.\nThe company skipped Vegas and waited until last March to introduce its 2023 lineup. And even then, the lauded A95 QD-OLED TV didn\u2019t actually ship until the fall. Sony is clearly working on a much different timeline than other TV makers these days.\nSo it should come as no surprise that Digital Trends\u2019 Caleb Denison is reporting that new TVs won\u2019t be part of Sony\u2019s CES 2024 presence. It sounds like the company has made some impressive Mini LED backlighting advancements that will appear in upcoming models \u2014 whenever they\u2019re ready.\nSony is still holding a press conference on January 8th, so maybe we\u2019ll get another look at Afeela at this year\u2019s show.\nJan 4\nJay Peters\nWith the new Remo Plus DoorCam 3 Plus LTE, AT&T\u2019s LTE network can serve as a backup if the camera\u2019s Wi-Fi connection drops out. This isn\u2019t the first security cam with cellular connectivity, but it\u2019s nice to see the feature coming to more cameras.\nThe DoorCam 3 Plus LTE will launch around late March, with pricing available in a similar timeframe, according to AT&T\u2019s Mike Van Horn.\nJan 4\nJon Porter\nDell\u2019s new 120Hz ultrawide monitors max out at 40 inches and 5K\nDell has a pair of new ultrawide monitors it\u2019s showing off ahead of CES, the 40-inch UltraSharp 40 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U4025QW) and the 34-inch UltraSharp 34 Curved Thunderbolt Hub Monitor (U3425WE). They\u2019re going on sale next month, with the larger model starting at $2,399.99, and the smaller at $1,019.99.\nAlthough Dell\u2019s announcement blog post notes that the monitors are targeting the likes of content creators, data scientists, and engineers rather than gamers, both monitors come with gaming-friendly 120Hz refresh rates. It\u2019s a part of Dell\u2019s aim for them to minimize eye-strain. To this end, they both also feature reduced blue light output, and have built-in ambient light sensors that adjust brightness and color temperatures on the fly. The monitors have been given a five-star certification for eye comfort by the testing organization T\u00dcV Rheinland.\nJan 4\nEmma Roth\nLG just made the fastest OLED gaming display yet\nLG Display, a manufacturer that makes and sells displays to other companies, is showing off a new OLED display that could soon appear in high-end gaming monitors. At 27 inches, this 1440p panel pairs a speedy 0.03ms response time with a 480Hz refresh rate \u2014 making it the fastest in OLED displays so far.\nLG\u2019s new screen is even better than the one in the 32-inch OLED \u201cDual-Hz\u201d gaming monitor (32GS95UE) it announced in December. While this monitor similarly offers a refresh rate of up to 480Hz, you have to toggle the display down to 1080p to take advantage of that speed.\nPagination\nVerge Deals\n/ Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox daily.\nThe Verge is a vox media network\n\u00a9 2024 Vox Media, LLC.

        "raw_content": "Inside CES 2024: A Recap of the Trade Show\u2019s Most Exciting Tech\nCES 2024 featured impressive state-of-the-art tech powering some of the most innovative devices.\nConsidered the Mecca of consumer tech, CES is one of the most anticipated trade shows of the year. And with good reason, as CES revelations tend to impress. Some of the most iconic CES product reveals include the Atari 800 in 1979, the CD in 1981 and the DVD in 1996, Commodore 64 in 1982, plasma televisions in 2001, 4G LTE and cloud-based music in 2011, 4K streaming in 2014, and more.\nHowever, not everything introduced to the market at CES turns to gold. In fact, most of the tech that captures the imagination with an impressive demonstration fails to capture the market.\nThis time, techies continued to display their new wares and inventions, including state-of-the-art televisions, smart devices, computers, cars, spatial computing, and more. Spiceworks News & Insights separates the noise from the genuinely revolutionary tech at CES 2024. Take a look.\nBest of CES 2024\n1. TVs\nSouth Korean consumer electronics major LG introduced its 77\u201d transparent 4K OLED TV, which is see-through when not in use and turned off. The invisible TV, called LG Signature OLED T, also features a contrast setting to resemble a conventional OLED TV, although why would anyone want to do this?\nLG\u2019s model also features the company\u2019s wireless tech for audio-visual transmission.\nSimilarly, Samsung also introduced its transparent OLED TV, a transparent MicroLED, and a transparent LCD one. Of the three, the MicroLED truly deserved the \u2018transparent\u2019 tag, not because of its screen panel but because of its design, which omits the bordering frame. Samsung\u2019s transparent MicroLED also performed the best in terms of brightness.\nThe Samsung MicroLED TV\u2019s one cm thickness and high pixel density also make it an attractive prospect compared to LG\u2019s, except the latter\u2019s product is going on sale in 2024 and is way more affordable.\n2. NVIDIA Special Address\nBefore CES 2024 kicked off, American semiconductor company NVIDIA conducted its three-day Special Address besides making its presence felt with a huge exhibition.\nThe company announced various hardware and software offerings, including three new graphics cards, viz., GeForce RTX 4080 Super, RTX 4070 Ti Super, and RTX 4070 Super, all of which double as gaming-cum-local AI dev chips.\nHowever, NVIDIA\u2019s broad spectrum of AI software for various use cases has allowed it to emerge as a key enabler of AI and forget partnerships with multiple companies across several sectors, some of which were displayed at CES 2024.\nSee Mor: AI and Beyond: Insights From NVIDIA Special Address at CES 2024\n3. Semiconductors by AMD, Intel\nAMD debuted its new Ryzen 8040 series mobile processors with AMD RDNA 3 integrated graphics and XDNA AI neural processor unit (NPU) to take on Intel. Based on the AM5 platform and the Zen 4 architecture, the 8000G series can offer a boost of up to 5.1 GHz.\nWhile AMD\u2019s new chips have the serious potential to dent Intels\u2019 revenue from the Meteor Lake lineup (even with the multi-chiplet module architecture), the company is focused on a refreshed Raptor Lake lineup of five new stock-keeping units (SKUs). This suggests the company expects mobile computing chips to be at the forefront of the semiconductor battle this year.\nIntel\u2019s five new 14th Gen Core HX platforms include those for Core i5, Core i7, and Core i9.\n4. AI\nAI is the biggest thing in tech right now, with everybody wanting to get in on it to improve their products. For others, it is simply a way to make their products more marketable. Nevertheless, AI and generative AI are the talk of the town, and without conflating the two with each other, look at the best AI tools and services at CES 2024.\nThe rabbit r1 is a new device on the market intended to make human interaction with smartphones more efficient. The $200 device has a unique form, a SIM card slot, a 2.88-inch display, a 2.3GHz MediaTek Helios P35 processor, 128 GB storage, and 4 GB RAM, supports Wi-Fi and Bluetooth, and eliminates the need to perform the tedious tasks of pulling out your smartphone, unlocking it, heading to the app you need to access, opening it, entering the relevant details, and getting the results.\nNope, we\u2019re not mocking it. The device indeed leverages an innovative technique based on a custom-made large action model to perform tasks as a human would as opposed to AI-driven assistants such as Alexa. It accepts inputs from the user through the camera and mic and interacts with apps on the smartphone to perform tasks such as booking an Uber or ordering a pizza.\nrabbit r1\u2019s initial two batches of 10,000 units were sold out as soon as they were introduced. rabbit r1 is available for preorder in the U.S., Canada, Japan, South Korea, the U.K., France, Italy, Germany, Netherlands, Ireland, Spain, Denmark, and Sweden.\nSpeaking of AI, the conversation would remain incomplete without the product that spurred the age of generative AI \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT. Volkswagen announced its vehicles would have ChatGPT preinstalled in the Passat, Tiguan, Golf, and its electric vehicles.\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also making strides in generative AI. The company showed off its new generative AI-driven Alexa, initially announced at its Devices and Services event in fall 2023. Alexa now derives its conversational skills from a custom-built large language model (LLM) to answer and address open-ended queries, something the previous Alexa Answers contributors-based tech couldn\u2019t deliver.\n5. Robotics\nCES 2024 visitors also got a glimpse of an updated Ballie, Samsung\u2019s personal home assistant, albeit only in a video. The robot now has a projector that detects posture, facial angle, etc., to project relevant media on the wall, the ceiling, or the floor. Ballie connects to and manages home appliances to deliver a personalized experience and, while the user is away, keeps them updated on the situation at home.\nOn the other hand, LG also introduced an AI agent intended to provide users with a \u201cZero Labor Home\u201d experience. The robotic agent features multi-modal functionality to perform housekeeping tasks using LG\u2019s smart home platform ThinQ. Like Ballie, LG\u2019s smart robot connects to home appliances for a personalized experience and is mobile.\n6.
